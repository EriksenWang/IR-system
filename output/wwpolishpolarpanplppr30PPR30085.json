    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe the current state of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard as an extension of the inventory of\nHagen et al. (1993)\n. The ice masses of Svalbard cover an area of ca 36 600 km 2 and more than 60% of the glaciated areas are glaciers which terminate in the sea at calving ice-cliffs. Recent data on the geometry of glacier tongues, their flow velocities and front position changes have been extracted from ASTER images acquired from 2000-2006 using automated methods of satellite image analysis. Analyses have shown that 163 Svalbard glaciers are of tidewater type (having contact with the ocean) and the total length of their calving ice-cliffs is 860 km. When compared with the previous inventory, 14 glaciers retreated from the ocean to the land over a 30-40 year period. Eleven formerly land-based glaciers now terminate in the sea. A new method of assessing the dynamic state of glaciers, based on patterns of frontal crevassing, has been developed. Tidewater glacier termini are divided into four groups on the basis of differences in crevasse patterns and flow velocity: (1) very slow or stagnant glaciers, (2) slow-flowing glaciers, (3) fast-flowing glaciers, (4) surging glaciers (in the active phase) and fast ice streams. This classification has enabled us to estimate total calving flux from Svalbard glaciers with an accuracy appreciably higher than that of previous attempts. Mass loss due to calving from the whole archipelago (excluding Kvitøya) is estimated to be 5.0-8.4 km 3 yr -1 (water equivalent -w.e.), with a mean value 6.75 ± 1.7 km 3 yr -1 (w.e.). Thus, ablation due to calving contributes as much as 17-25% (with a mean value 21%) to the overall mass loss from Svalbard glaciers. By implication, the contribution of Svalbard iceberg flux to sea-level rise amounts to ca 0.02 mm yr -1 . Also calving flux in the Arctic has been considered and the highest annual specific mass balance attributable to iceberg calving has been found for Svalbard.

    "full_text": "Climate warming is more pronounced in the Arctic than in the mid-latitudes (cf. ACIA 2005, IPCC 2007). The response of glaciers to climate change is a good mea-sure of long-term climate trends and the environmental consequences of warming. There is much evidence that Svalbard glaciers are very sensitive to climatic change, presumably because the influence of the North Atlantic ocean current system (Walczowski and Piechura 2006). The ice masses of Svalbard cover an area of ca 36 600 km 2 and are among the largest glaciated areas in the Arctic (Hagen et al. 1993;Dowdeswell and Hambrey 2002). Glaciers that flow into the sea and terminate in an ice cliff from which icebergs are discharged are called tidewater glaciers (Van der Veen 1996) and the breakage of icebergs from the cliff is termed \"calving\". The term calving glaciers is also used; these are defined as glaciers calving brash and icebergs into lakes, fiords or open sea (Post and Motyka 1995). Tidewater glaciers are a characteristic feature of the Svalbard environment. They constitute more than 60% of the total ice-covered area. A recent study by Dowdeswell et al. (2008) indicates that calving from the Austfonna ice cap (8120 km 2 ) on Nordaustlandet, NE Svalbard alone amounts to 2.5 km 3 yr -1 . This represents as much as 30-40% of the annual ablation from this ice cap. This is a general indication of the importance of tidewater glaciers for the mass budget of Svalbard ice masses.\n\nClimate warming affects tidewater glaciers through changes in the surface mass balance components, the dynamic response of glaciers, and the influence of warmer water on the ice cliff -ocean water interface. Generally, without taking into account active surges of glaciers discussed later in this paper, increased production of icebergs is a result of the dynamic response of glaciers terminating in the ocean to a warmer environment. Such a process has been evident in Greenland over the last few years (e.g. Dowdeswell 2006;Rignot and Kanagaratnam 2006;Nettles et al. 2008). The greater the transfer of glacier ice from land to the sea, the greater the eustatic sea level rise. We consider that this effect was underestimated by the last IPCC Report (IPCC 2007).\n\nSvalbard glaciers contribute to global sea level rise because of their negative mass balance. Mass loss due to calving is still not properly studied. Existing estimates of the volume of icebergs lost by calving are both rather crude (Dowdeswell 1989;Lefauconnier and Hagen 1991;Hagen et al. 2003a;Dowdeswell and Hagen 2004) and variable, presumably due to the limited availability of data. To better estimate the mass of ice calved by tidewater glaciers in Svalbard, more data about the glaciers themselves and processes responsible for calving are needed.\n\nA detailed glacier inventory of the Svalbard archipelago was compiled by Hagen et al. (1993) in the \"Glacier Atlas of Svalbard and Jan Mayen\". But almost all of the data presented there were derived from topographic maps at a scale of 1:100 000 (prepared from aerial photos taken in 1936) and more recent aerial photographs taken before 1990. As a result of the retreat and thinning of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard observed since the beginning of the 20th century (e.g. Koryakin 1975;Jania 1988aJania , 2002;;Hagen et al. 1993Hagen et al. , 2005) ) this inventory needs to be updated. The aim of this paper is to document the current status of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard, especially in terms of the nature of their calving fronts and present dy-namic state. The paper aims to continue the work of Hagen et al. (1993) focusing only on the tidewater glaciers. Glaciers draining into lakes with no contact with the sea are not considered.\n\nRecent data on the geometry of glacier tongues, their flow velocities and front position changes have been extracted from satellite imagery. Characteristics of all tidewater glaciers of Svalbard were examined (see Appendix) and compared with data presented by Hagen et al. (1993). A more precise estimate of ice mass loss by calving from the whole archipelago is another objective of this work. The calculation of ice fluxes is based upon observations of calving glaciers on satellite images and very sparse ground survey data (published and unpublished). The main sources of data used are ASTER images acquired from 2000-2006, mainly in July and August (cf. Table 1). The relatively long intervals between acquisition dates for many ASTER image pairs are due to the infrequent breaks in the cloud cover in the ablation season. The Svalbard glaciers\n\nThe Svalbard archipelago is located at the NW limit of the European continental shelf between 76.50-80.80°N and 10-34°E. It consists of four main islands: Spitsbergen, Nordaustlandet, Barentsøya, Edgeøya (Fig. 1) and ca 150 smaller islands. The total area of Svalbard is 62 800 km 2 and ca 60%, or about 36 600 km 2 of this area is covered by glaciers (Hagen et al. 1993). Various types of glacier are found. Dominant by area are the large continuous ice masses that are divided into individual ice streams by mountain ridges and nunataks. Small cirque glaciers are also numerous, especially in the alpine regions of western Spitsbergen. Several large ice caps are located in the relatively flat areas of eastern Svalbard. These ice caps calve into the sea. The total length of calving ice fronts in Svalbard is about 1000 km. All margins are grounded (Dowdeswell 1989). Maximum ice thicknesses of 500-600 m occur in Amundsenisen in South Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap in Nordaustlandet. The total ice volume of Svalbard is estimated to be ca 7 000 km 3 (Hagen et al. 1993).\n\nPermafrost conditions prevail in Svalbard and the depth of permafrost varies from 50 to several hundred meters. However, the glaciers in Svalbard are often polythermal, which means that some parts of the ice masses are temperate (at the pressure melting point) while other parts are at sub-freezing temperatures. In general the lower and thinner parts of the glaciers are frozen, to a depth of as much as 100 m. The consequence of this is that the thinner glaciers are often frozen to the ground. The thicker glaciers have temperate parts from which water drains throughout the year. Large icings are often formed in front of land-terminating polythermal glaciers when meltwater slowly drains out of the glacier during winter and freezes on the cold frozen ground. Winter drainage can often be observed in front of tidewater glaciers as an upwelling of water at the calving front.\n\nOwing to the low ice temperatures and fairly low accumulation rates, the flow rate of Svalbard glaciers is generally low. In general, glaciers that terminate on land flow much more slowly than tidewater glaciers. Typical surface velocities are less than 10 m yr -1 close to the equilibrium line altitude of glaciers that terminate on land, whereas some calving glaciers have much higher velocities -100 m yr -1 or more. Kronebreen in Kongsfjorden is by far the fastest flowing glacier in Svalbard, having a velocity of about 2 m d -1 , or 700-800 m yr -1 at the calving front.\n\nSurging glaciers are common in Svalbard (Liestøl 1969;Jania 1988a;Lefauconnier and Hagen 1991;Hagen et al. 1993;Dowdeswell et al. 1991;Jiskoot et al. 2000). A surge event results in a large ice flux from the higher to the lower regions of a glacier, usually accompanied by a rapid advance of the glacier front and, in the case of tidewater glaciers, by increased iceberg production. For instance, the 1250 km 2 Hinlopenbreen, which surged in 1970, calved about 2 km 3 of icebergs in a single year (Liestøl 1973). Table 1 and Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2. Sketch of coverage of Svalbard by ASTER (solid frame) and Landsat 7 (dashed frame) imagery used in this inventory (Nos. of scenes correspond to Nos. in Table 1).\n\nObservations of front positions indicate a general retreat of glaciers in Svalbard over the last 80 years. The Little Ice Age ended in Svalbard about 100 years ago, when most glaciers reached their maximum Holocene extent.\n\nAnnual mass-balance measurements have been made on several (<1%) Svalbard glaciers for up to 40 years. Consistent with the general recession, most of these glaciers have a negative mass balance, but with no discernible change in trend. The winter accumulation undergoes an inter-annual variations but they are fairly small. The mean summer ablation is also stable with no obvious trend. However, there are large inter-annual variations in the annual net mass balance and the summer ablation clearly controls these variations. While low-altitude glaciers are shrinking steadily, glaciers with high-altitude accumulation areas have mass balances closer to zero or even positive in some years.\n\nEstimates of the total mass balance of Svalbard glaciers vary between -5 to -14 km 3 yr -1 or a specific net mass balance of -0.12 to -0.38 m yr -1 , equivalent to a sea level rise of 0.01 to 0.04 mm yr -1 (Hagen et al. 2003a, b). There are thus still large uncertainties about the overall mass balance and the calving flux. In this paper we will attempt to improve the latter estimate.\n\nThe optical sensor ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) on board the Terra satellite has proved to be a useful tool for glacier mapping and monitoring (e.g. Paul et al. 2002;Paul and Kääb 2005;Svoboda and Paul 2007;Bolch et al. 2008;Molnia 2008; http://www.glims.org/). ASTER imagery has relatively high spatial resolution in the visible and near visible IR bands (15 m and 30 m), and ASTER's along-track stereo sensor allows photogrammetric DEM generation. ASTER images have previously been used for studies of Svalbard glaciers (e.g. Dowdeswell and Benham 2003;Kääb et al. 2005;Kääb 2005). Owing to a dearth of cloud-and snow-free ASTER images of Svalbard, however, three Landsat 7 images were also used in this study. The images used are listed in Table 1 and shown on Figs 1 and 2, and were acquired over 7 summer ablation seasons.\n\nThe most important morphometric features of all tidewater glaciers are: (1) glacier area, (2) length of centerline, (3) glacier mean slope, (4) length of crevassed zone, (5) area of crevassed zone close to the active calving front, and (6) length of ice cliff. These features were measured on the geocoded ASTER and Landsat 7 images using ArcGIS software. The surface velocity fields of glacier termini were derived from ASTER image pairs and from published and unpublished ground survey data.\n\nThe delineation of glacier basins is crucial for a proper glacier inventory. The boundaries of the Svalbard tidewater glaciers were mapped automatically (Fig. 3a) using the ratio of ASTER bands 3 (15 m resolution) and 4 (30 m resolution) to generate a glacier mask, and by automated raster line to vector conversion. A panchromatic False Colour Composite (FCC) of ASTER bands 432 was used to manually delineate those glaciers for which expert knowledge was needed (Fig. 3b).\n\nIn several cases, the definition of ice cliff lines by automatic classification of glacier areas was problematic because it was difficult to distinguish between the glacier and ice floating on the water (icebergs, ice brash probably mixed with sea ice-floes) close to the calving cliff (Fig. 4a).

DEMs prepared from the ASTER stereo bands (in PCI Orthoengine software) were used to delineate boundaries between individual glacier basins. Definition of glacier boundaries was achieved by visual supervision of the \"watershed\" procedure in the ArcGIS software system and other methods such as slope and aspect analysis (Fig. 5). In cases where slopes are low, as in the vicinity of ice divides and in ice cap interiors, the delineation of any particular glacier basin is difficult. The same is true in respect of glacier tributaries and confluences. In such cases, delineation is necessarily subjective (cf. Jania 1988b; Hagen et al. 1993). The length of the glacier along its centre-line, the length of the active calving front and the length of the terminal ice cliff were derived manually using ArcGIS software. Other specific methods applied in this study are outlined in subsequent paragraphs.\n\nThe inventory of tidewater glaciers listed in the Appendix contains an identification number for each glacier, the name of the glacier unit, information on the satellite imagery employed to map the glacier, data on the length and area of the glacier, the length and area of the terminal crevassed zone, the length of the terminal ice-cliff, the average ice-marginal retreat rate (area of glacier retreat divided by the length of the ice cliff), the retreat rate measured along the glacier center-line, a symbol for the glacier front type, and an estimate of the calving intensity (Table I in the Appendix). The system used for the identification of glaciers in this work is the same as that used in Hagen's et al. (1993) inventory. It includes the number of regions of Svalbard (see Appendix: Fig. 12), the glacier identification number from the World Glacier Inventory (WGI) and the name of glacier basin. Some glaciers which were formerly confluent are now separated, owing to significant recession (Fig. 6a, b). Other glaciers that are still confluent have very different dynamics, in which case they are classified separately for the purpose of our inventory. They still have the common WGI identification number (Appendix -Table I), but are given either separate names derived from topographic maps (see an example on Fig. 6b) or consecutive numbers (for instance Vasilievbreen 1, Vasilievbreen 2, cf. Fig. 6c). 94 Małgorzata Błaszczyk, Jacek A. Jania and Jon Ove Hagen The inventory includes data on the area of the glaciers. It must be emphasised, however, that the \"area of tidewater glacier\" is defined differently from that of its \"total basin\". When a tidewater glacier has a compound basin, only that part of it feeding the calving front was taken into consideration and presented here as the \"glacier area\". This implies that tributary glaciers clearly separated from the main basin by moraines were not included in the \"glacier area\" measurements. Similarly, marginal sections of tidewater glaciers that terminate on land were not included in the area calculation. This reflects the general objective of this paper, which is the assessment of the dynamics of tidewater glaciers and the calculation of iceberg fluxes from them. As a result, data on the glacier area presented in the atlas of Hagen et al. (1993) are not directly comparable with the values presented in this inventory.\n\nFor the large ice caps of Nordaustlandet, the \"areas of glacier basins\" were taken from Hagen et al. (1993). Owing to incomplete ablation season coverage by ASTER scenes, Landsat 7 images were substituted for these areas. A consequence of this was that it was not possible to define ice divides and glacier borders by the method described earlier. The other parameters for that island were updated using the methods described earlier. Low-resolution ASTER images (150×150 m) available in the LP DAAC inventory (http://edcimswww.cr.usgs.gov/pub/imswelcome/) were used in the categorization of Kvitøyjøkulen (on the small island Kvitøya, NE Svalbard).\n\nAll fronts of Svalbard tidewater glaciers have been analyzed and compared with Hagen's et al. (1993) inventory. Detailed visual analysis of ASTER images (RGB -bands 321) enabled us to identify the present state of their termini (i.e. whether the glacier terminates on land or in the sea; Fig. 7, Fig. 10). In several cases, it was difficult to define the glacier state solely on the basis of an ASTER image e.g. Eidembreen (Fig. 7a). The tongue of this glacier has contact with a lake, but no canal can be identified between lake and sea on the 2001 ASTER image. Therefore this glacier was not identified as a tidewater glacier.\n\nAll glaciers terminating in the ocean at an ice-cliff longer than 150 m were classified as tidewater glaciers. Owing to shading by mountain ridges the fronts of some very small glaciers were hard to identify on ASTER images. Snow cover on, and the presence of sea-ice close to glacier fronts on some June images caused further classification problems.\n\nIn total, 163 glaciers were classified as tidewater glaciers in this study (Appendix -Fig. 12). This number includes 11 glaciers that were characterized as \"land based\" in Hagen's inventory, but which are now in contact with the sea. Presumably these glaciers either advanced into the sea or have retreated from a frontal moraine shoal or peninsula into deeper water. 14 glaciers characterized as \"calving glaciers\" by Hagen et al. (1993) no longer extend into the sea (Fig. 7b).\n\nASTER image pairs acquired a minimum of one year apart provide a good overview of glacier front fluctuations. Nevertheless, inter-annual variations in the rate of terminus position changes of tidewater glaciers have to be surveyed carefully and their effects separated from those of seasonal fluctuations (winter advance and summer retreat). Our data analysis provides snapshots of margin position changes and confirms that most Svalbard calving glaciers are now in recession. We measured the average front fluctuation of 39 glaciers, for which pairs of summer ASTER images separated by several years are available (cf. Fig. 8). Results are shown in Table I  (Appendix). Two methods of measurement were used:\n\n(1) front retreat along the glacier center-line and (2) average terminus retreat (area of that part of the glacier which has retreated, divided by the length of ice-cliff measured on the first image). The majority of glaciers in our survey have retreated at an average rate of 30-150 m yr -1 . Changes in the margin position of 9 glaciers were close to zero, while two glaciers have advanced (Vestre Torellbreen by 80 m in 2005-2006and Chydeniusbreen by 200 m in 2001-2002)).\n\nPublished data confirm a general recession of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard. The retreat of Hansbreen, for example, is as much as 40 m yr -1 (Jania 2006). Other glaciers flowing into Hornsund Fiord have retreated by 30-50 m yr -1 during the last few decades (Głowacki and Jania 2008), as have those draining Austfonna. Individual drainage basins of this ice cap retreated a few tens of meters per year on average, whereas the ice-cliff of Etonbreen retreated at an average rate of 120 m yr -1 (Dowdeswell et al. 2008). The front of Nathorstbreen retreated 14 km (ca 135 m yr -1 ) between 1898 and 2002, with rates varying from 77 to 250 m yr -1 (Carlsen et al. 2003). The terminus recession of Aavatsmarkbreen was as much as 700 m (100 m yr -1 ) during the period 2000-2006. Other glaciers in the Forland-sundet area (NW Spitsbergen): Konowbreen, Osbornebreen and Dahlbreen are also retreating relatively quickly (Grześ et al. 2008).\n\nNevertheless, several glaciers have surged at relatively rapid rates in recent times (e.g. Tunabreen, which advanced about 1400 m during the period 1999-2004). According to Dowdeswell and Benham (2003), the terminus of Perseibreen advanced at rate over 400 m yr -1 between June 2000 and May 2001 and this rate increased to over 750 m yr -1 between May and August 2001. From 1995 to 1998 the ice-front of Fridtjovbreen advanced 4000 m in 33 months (Lønne 2003). The average recession rate for the entire population of Svalbard tidewater glaciers was estimated as about 30 m yr -1 .\n\nThe flow velocities of tidewater glaciers vary on different time scales (diurnal, seasonal and interannual). Therefore, the time interval between measurements is an important influence on the results. Certainly, velocity data acquired over short time periods (e.g. by InSAR) are not necessarily representative of the annual mean velocity. There are few direct measurements of the velocity of Svalbard tidewater glaciers. Owing to a dearth of repeat ground survey measurements for areas close to glacier termini, a feature-tracking technique was applied to sequential ASTER imagery from 2000-2006 in order to determine surface velocities near several glacier fronts (Table 2).  Several previous studies of the velocities of Svalbard glaciers have used this feature-tracking method (Lefauconnier et al. 1994;Rolstad et al. 1997;Dowdeswell and Benham 2003;Kääb et al. 2005). However, they only relate to fast-flowing and surging-glaciers, and used image pairs acquired only a short time apart. Only Kääb et al. (2005) derived an annual surface velocity field for the lowermost 10 km of the fast-flowing Kronebreen. For the present work, the available images were of sufficient quality and the time periods between successive ASTER image acquisitions were long enough that the frontal velocity fields of 27 glaciers could be measured for one-year and two-year periods.\n\nThe annual surface velocities of glaciers were derived from measurements of horizontal displacements of surface features (crevasses, supraglacial moraine elements) that could be unambiguously recognized on successive images. An example is shown in Fig. 8. In the absence of ground control-points, one ASTER image was used as the reference co-ordinate system for a second image. Dowdeswell and Benham (2003) suggested that the velocity error from this source is probably within a half to one ASTER pixel (7.5-15 m yr -1 ). The estimated accuracy of velocity measurements derived from repeat ASTER images in this study is probably better than ± 30 m yr -1 .\n\nFor 16 very slow or stagnant tidewater glaciers, very small terminal crevassed areas were noted. For these glaciers there was no measurable surface velocity on ASTER images (15 m resolution) in the region near the glacier fronts, even over a two-years interval (marked with stars in Table 2). Such glaciers are probably in the quiescent phase of a surge cycle.\n\n162 11 Monacobreen 700-800 1995-1996 (active phase of surge) Murray et al. 2003b 172 14 Odinjokulen N <30* 2001-2002 ASTER (MB) 172 15 Tommelbreen <30* 2001-2002 ASTER (MB) 173 02 Sven Ludvigbreen <30* 2001-2002 ASTER (MB) 174 04 Moltkebreen <30* 2003-2006 ASTER (MB) 174 06 Hochstatterbreen <30* 2003-2006 ASTER (MB) 211 08 nameless 238 1995 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 221 02 Palanderbreen 36-49 1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 222 08 Aldousbreen 95-142 1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 222 09 Frazerbreen 307 1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 222 10 Idunbreen 232 1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 232 03 S Franklinbreen 35-74 1995/1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 232 04 N Franklinbreen 14-49 1995/1996 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 241 03 Sabinebreen <11 1995 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 242 01 Rijpbreen 128 1995 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 251 06 Duvebreen 170-205 1995 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 252 02 Nilsenbreen 84 1995 (winter) Sharov and Etzold 2005 Table 3): glaciers with registered surge (dots) and glaciers with evidence of surge in their morphology (triangles).

In the active phase of a surge, the ice flow velocity increases by several orders of magnitude. Fast down-glacier transfer of ice is observed, the glacier surface becomes badly crevassed (cf. Fig. 10d), and frontal advance is often noted (Meier and Post 1969). After a surge, glaciers may stagnate for periods of decades or even centuries. Thinning of the glacier tongue and frontal retreat have commonly been observed during the quiescent phase of a surge cycle.\n\nThe active phase of surging affects the ice flux from tidewater glaciers (cf. Table 2) and the calving rate is naturally increased. Based on published data, 55 tidewater glaciers (33% of all tidewater glaciers) have been considered as surge-type (Table 3, Fig. 9). However, a new approach to the evaluation of the number of surge-type glaciers within the population of Svalbard tidewater glaciers has been made in this study. On the basis of publications, unpublished reports, personal communications and interpretations of aerial photographs and satellite images (e.g. folded foliation and looped medial moraines visible on glacier surfaces), up to 43% of Svalbard tidewater glaciers could be classified as surge type (Fig. 9). These glaciers were probably actively surging at some time during the 20 th century.\n\nThe calculation of the volume of ice lost by calving of icebergs from a tidewater glacier is possible when the following quantities are known: (1) the velocity of the glacier averaged over the cross sectional area of the glacier terminus, (2) ice-cliff area, (3) glacier front advance or retreat. It can be described by:\n\nwhere: Q c is the volumetric flux of icebergs, V is the mean ice flow velocity, C is the cliff length, H is the ice thickness and X is front retreat (positive) or advance (negative).\n\nThe estimation of iceberg production from the whole Svalbard archipelago requires these data for every tidewater glacier on the archipelago but we have no data of any kind for most glaciers. Therefore, we have tried to approximate the annual rate of ice movement from the pattern and size of the zone of crevasses on each tidewater glacier in Svalbard.\n\nOur classification of tidewater glaciers according to their dynamics is based on the size of the crevassed zone close to the glacier termini. A relationship between glacier velocity and the occurrence of crevasses was used to estimate the dynamics of all tidewater glaciers in Svalbard. This approach is predicted upon a simple assumption: when glacier speed is high, more crevasses are noted in the frontal part of a glacier and the area of crevassing is larger (i.e. a fast glacier produces a larger crevasse system near its front).\n\nCrevasses on tidewater glaciers are generally parallel or semi-parallel to the ice-cliff and their origin is related to the increase of tensile stresses in the lower reaches of the glacier (cf. Van der Veen 1999), as longitudinal gradient in flow velocity rises when the ice approaches the glacier terminus. Although undulations in the underlying bedrock surface may influence the size and pattern of a crevasse field to some extent, flow velocity is assumed to be the primary influence. In active phase of a surge cycle, a substantial part of glacier is usually heavily crevassed (cf. Fig. 10d).\n\nAs linear features, crevasses are easily identified on the surface of glaciers registered on Terra-ASTER satellite images (even when their width is less than 15 m). It is possible to define the distribution and patterns of crevasses semi-automati- cally using the remote sensing texture analysis (MaZda, cf. Fig. 4b) and GIS software (e-Cognition, ArcGIS) supported by manual digitization of crevassed areas. Data on the near terminus velocity of different types of glaciers were required for classification of glaciers according to their dynamics. Flow velocity measurements for 46 glaciers were obtained (Table 2). From these measurements made over the last two decades we used velocity data from only 33 glaciers. Analysis of the dynamic status of tidewater glaciers was based on several characteristics: length of glacier, length of crevassed zone, area of glacier, area of crevassed zone and length of cliff, as acquired from satellite imagery. Owing to the difficulties with determining of crevasses zone due to snow cover on glacier front, some of the velocity information was rejected. 16 apparently stagnant glaciers that currently have very small crevassed areas and no discernible motion (cf. Table 2) fall into first category of \"very slow or stagnant glaciers\". The morphometric features of a further 17 glaciers were compared with their mean annual flow velocity (Table 4).\n\nThe highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71) was found between 17 glacier velocities and the length and area of crevassed zones. In practice, it is easier to measure the linear extent of the crevassed zone upstream from the ice-cliff along the centerline than to measure its area. A multiple regression with use of both parameters, length and area of crevassed zones, was also calculated, but correlation coefficient of regression equation was too low (r = 0.56). Therefore parameter \"length of the crevassed zone\" was used for further velocity and calving flux assessments. In order to estimate the velocities of all the tidewater glaciers in the archipelago, the glaciers were classified into four groups with different dynamics (Table 5): (1) very slow or stagnant glaciers with velocities (Vg) in the range 10 ± 5 m yr -1 and length of crevassed zone (Lc) of 0-300 m, (2) slow-flowing glaciers with Vg of 70 ± 30 m yr -1 and Lc of 300-1000 m, (3) fast-flowing glaciers with Vg of 200 ± 50 m yr -1 and Lc of ³ 1000 m, (4) surging glaciers (in the active phase) and fast ice streams with Vg > ca 700 m yr -1 and Lc of a few kilometers. Ranges (estimated errors) in velocities in individual groups are assumed on the basis of sparse data on glacier motion. Examples of the different dynamic categories of glaciers are presented in Fig. 10.\n\nEvery tidewater glacier on Svalbard was assigned to one of the above groups and an average velocity for a given dynamic type was applied to all glaciers of that type. Special attention was paid to those glaciers that have recently surged. Their surfaces are heavily crevassed but they are slow moving or even stagnant. Thus, every glacier with traces of a surge on its surface was examined individually by applying the feature tracking method to ASTER images from different years to determine its velocity. Other sources of data (publications, unpublished information) were also used for this purpose.\n\nThe classification presented allowed us to approximate the average flow velocity of every tidewater glacier in the archipelago on the basis of length of the crevassed zone. As a result of classification, very slow or stagnant glaciers constitute 49% of Svalbard tidewater glaciers, while slow glaciers make up 30% of the whole tidewater glacier population, and fast glaciers make up 19%. Only 2% of all tidewater glaciers were surging during the 2000-2006 study period.\n\nData on the cross-sectional area of the calving termini of glaciers are essential for the calculation of ice discharge into the sea. Such data are not available for the majority of Svalbard tidewater glaciers. Therefore, estimates of the cross sectional areas of all calving tongues were based on measurements of the lengths of Table 4 Correlation coefficients between velocity of glaciers (Vg) and their morphometric parameters.

The length of all tidewater glacier cliffs was measured using geocoded AS-TER images (Table 6). This amounts to 860 km, a figure which is 16% shorter than that proposed by Dowdeswell (1989) -1028 km. This may simply reflect reduction of seaward margins of tidewater glaciers in around last 40 years.\n\nThe average ice thickness near the terminus was estimated from airborne and ground-based radio echo soundings of some dozens of glaciers and from the very sparse data on ocean depth close to the present ice front positions (Dowdeswell et al. 1984;Drewry and Liestøl 1985;Hagen et al. 2003a). From this data average thickness of glacier fronts in the archipelago is estimated to be about 100 m ± 10 m.\n\nAn extensive analysis of images has enabled us to obtain other data necessary to estimate the annual calving flux of ice from Svalbard glaciers to the ocean in the first years of the 21 st century. The calving loss from glaciers with stable ice front positions was estimated to be about 5.2 km 3 yr -1 ± 1.5 km 3 yr -1 (Table 7).\n\nTerminus position changes of about 30 tidewater glaciers were measured and, for the purposes of calculation of the calving flux, an average retreat rate by 106 Małgorzata Błaszczyk, Jacek A. Jania and Jon Ove Hagen Table 6 The length of ice cliffs on the main islands of Svalbard: L 1 - Dowdeswell (1989); L 2 -from ASTER satellite images. Island Length of ice cliffs L 1 [km] L 2 [km] Spitsbergen 484 388.4 Nordaustlandet 306 272.3 Edgeøya 79 68.7 Prins Karls Forland 17 8.9 Barentsøya 23 8.8 Storøya 13 12 Kvitøya 106 100 Sum 1028 km 859.1 km 30 m yr -1 was assigned to the whole population. Taking into account the mean recession rate of all the tidewater glaciers, the total length of ice-cliffs (860 km) and the average thickness of glaciers at the terminus (100 m), the additional calving ice flux as a result of glacier retreat was estimated to be 2.28 km 3 yr -1 . The total calving flux from Svalbard glaciers (excluding Kvitøya) was estimated to be 7.5 km 3 yr -1 . Overall uncertainty on the calving flux is derived assuming: average ice thickness of 100 m ± 10 m, mean ice flow velocity and error of velocity according to Table 5, the average front retreat of 30 m yr -1 ± 10 m yr -1 , the cliff length from Table I (Appendix) and error of the cliff length of ±15 m. These quantities are the best possible values based on our observations. Sum of individual errors of calving flux of all glaciers amounts to 1.9 km 3 yr -1 .\n\nThus, the total calving flux from Svalbard glaciers was estimated to be in the range 5.6-9.4 km 3 yr -1 of ice (5.0-8.4 km 3 yr -1 water equivalent -w.e.) with the best estimate of 7.5 ± 1.9 km 3 yr -1 (6.75 ± 1.7 km 3 yr -1 w.e.).\n\nThe present analysis of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard is based on examination of ASTER satellite images from the period 2000-2006, while data in Hagen's et al. (1993) inventory were collected from sources of different origin and age. Recent data have shown that there are 163 tidewater glaciers in Svalbard. Compared to the previous inventory, 14 glaciers have retreated from the sea to land during the last 30-40 years, and 11 formerly land-based glaciers are now in contact with the sea.\n\nIn this inventory, tidewater glaciers were classified into four groups on the basis of their dynamic state and frontal crevasse patterns: (1) very slow or stagnant glaciers, (2) slow-flowing glaciers, (3) fast-flowing glaciers, (4) surging glaciers (in the active phase) and fast ice streams.\n\nOur estimates of total mass loss due to calving from Svalbard glaciers (excluding Kvitøya) yield values of 5.0-8.4 km 3 yr -1 (w.e.) with the best estimate being 6.75 ± 1.7 km 3 yr -1 (w.e.), which is substantially more than the calving flux of 4 ± 1 km 3 yr -1 (w.e.) given by Hagen et al. (2003a) and significantly less than the value estimated by Lefauconnier et al. (1993), 7.44-9.94 km 3 yr -1 .\n\nThe differences between these estimates stem from assuming general velocity for the whole archipelago. Hagen et al. (2003a) estimated the average velocity of calving fronts through the archipelago at 20-40 m yr -1 , and general retreat of glacier fronts at 10 m yr -1 . Lefauconnier et al. (1993) calculated linear calving (flow velocity plus retreat of the front) on 75 m per year for Spitsbergen and 100 meters per year for the islands of the eastern Svalbard. Therefore, Hagen et al. (2003a) result is smaller because they assumed too low velocity for all Svalbard glaciers. Results of Lefauconnier et al. (1993) are giving too high values, because they esti-mated the calving flux by averaging velocities of few glaciers larger and faster than the majority of their population.\n\nThe total surface runoff from Svalbard glaciers due to melting of snow and ice was estimated by Hagen et al. (2003a) as roughly 25 ± 5 km 3 yr -1 , which corresponds to a specific runoff of 680 ± 140 mm yr -1 . This is only slightly more than the annual snow accumulation. Taking this value into account and knowing the area of the tidewater glaciers studied (21210 km 2 ), the total amount of meltwater discharged from them can be estimated as 14.5 ± 3 km 3 yr -1 (w. e.). Thus, the mass loss by calving from these glaciers is on the order of 47% of the surface melting and constitutes ca 32% of the total mass loss from all the Svalbard tidewater glaciers. Comparison of total melting (25 ± 5 km 3 yr -1 ) from Svalbard glaciers with our estimates of mass loss due to calving suggests that calving contributes ca 17-25%, with a mean value of 21% (compared to 16% in Hagen et al. 2003a) to the overall mass loss from Svalbard glaciers, which is a significant component of the overall mass balance.\n\nOur calculations of ice flux are sensitive to the assumed average retreat rate for all glaciers. Comparison of results shows that the calving flux stemming from a rate of glacier retreat on the order of 30 m yr -1 would be 2.3 km 3 yr -1 , or 30% of the total calving flux from the archipelago. By comparison, for an ice front retreat of 40 m yr -1 the calving flux would be 3 km 3 yr -1 , or 37% of the total calving flux. To give better estimate of the calving flux, there is a need for some more accurate data on ice thickness and front retreat for the whole archipelago. There is also need for more data on ice velocity to improve classification and decrease errors of calculated calving flux.\n\nThe length of all tidewater glacier cliffs is 860 km, a figure that is 16% less than that proposed by Dowdeswell (1989) -1028 km. One can expect further length reductions due to the continued recession of glacier fronts.\n\nWe are fairly certain that about 33% of all tidewater glaciers (54 in number) are of surge-type, but indirect evidence of past surges (e.g. folded medial moraines, looped foliation and frontal push moraines) found on ASTER images suggest that this percentage may actually be larger (40-45%).\n\nAccording to Jania and Hagen (1996), the velocities of glaciers of Severnaya Zemlya and Novaya Zemlya vary between 10-150 m yr -1 . A few glaciers in Franz Josef Land and northern Novaya Zemlya have velocities highier than 160 m yr -1 (Sharov 2005). The Academy of Sciences Ice Cap, the largest in the Russian Arctic, has four fast flowing outlets with lateral shear zones and a maximum velocity of 140 m yr -1 (Dowdeswell et al. 2002). In Svalbard the flow of several glaciers is faster than 200 m yr -1 , suggesting that they flow appreciably faster than glaciers in other parts of the Eurasian Arctic. This is probably related to the higher mass turnover in the warmer, wetter climate of Svalbard.\n\nEstimated calving fluxes for Arctic are shown in Table 8. Some data are somewhat out-of-date and there is not data for the whole Canadian Arctic. However, despite the lack of a complete error assessment we may conclude that losses by calving from Svalbard appear to be the highest in the Eurasian Arctic.\n\nThe contribution of Svalbard iceberg flux to sea-level rise may be as much as 0.02 mm yr -1 and it is certainly greater than the value of 0.01 mm yr -1 presented by Hagen et al. (2003a). Although it is a small part of the total sea-level rise from glaciers and ice caps (estimated at 1.1 mm yr -1 ; Meier et al. 2007) and minuscule compared with the contributions of Greenland to sea-level rise (0.5 mm yr -1 ; Rignot and Kanagaratnam 2006), the annual specific mass loss due to calving from the Svalbard Archipelago appears to be the largest in the Arctic (Fig. 11). One may reasonably predict that some present-day tidewater glaciers will retreat to the land  and that the lengths of the remaining ice cliffs will be reduced. Therefore, in the coming decades, a decrease in the calving flux may be expected.\n\nIn conclusion, we suggest that area and pattern of crevasses near tidewater glacier termini seems to be a simple and reliable indicator of the dynamics of these glaciers. It also enables the estimation of the likely flow velocity and calving flux of individual glaciers in Svalbard.\n\nR 2 [m] Front position change (years) and source Ft Qc [km 3 yr -1 ] 111 01 Pedasjenkobreen 11 7, 6 6700 36.2 0 2350 0 0 ASTER, 2003-2005 1 0.0024 111 03 Sonklarbreen 11 7 13500 207.2 0 17060 0 1 0.0171 111 05 Negribreen 11 7 51000 916.2 0.51 21240 200 -73 -50 ASTER, 2003-2005 1 0.0212 111 06 Johansenbreen 11 7 10500 39.8 0 1030 0 0 ASTER, 2003-2005 1 0.0010 Petermannbreen 11 16, 7, 20, 41 19200 114.8 1.45 3390 600 -22 -40 ASTER, 2003-2005 2 0.0238 112 01 Hayesbreen 11 16, 41 21000 119.7 1.37 3950 400 2 0.0277 112 06 Ulvebreen 11 16 15400 54.7 0.15 1960 180 1 0.0020 114 05 Nordsysselbreen 11 17 18820 45.9 0 420 0 1 0.0004 114 06 Inglefieldbreen 11 17 20170 59.3 0 4620 0 1 0.0046 114 07 Arnesenbreen 11 17 11820 21.0 1.63 2300 1100 3 0.0460 114 08 Beresnikovbreen 11 17 8200 23.2 0 1760 0 1 0.0018 114 11 Richardsbreen 11 23, 17 12200 55.1 32.19 2150 1220 1 0.0022 114 12 Thomsonbreen 1 11 23 6900 19.5 0 1200 0 1 0.0014 Thomsonbreen 2 11 23 9200 18.9 0.15 1360 280 1 0.0012 115 01 Kvalbreen 11 1 15000 62.0 0.97 3670 300 -67 -85 ASTER, 2002-2004 2 0.0257 115 02 Strongbreen 11 17, 23 15500 49.7 0.06 3850 80 -36 -43 ASTER, 2002-2005 1 0.0038 Morsjnevbreen 11 17, 23 20200 92.3 0.16 4820 200 -41 -67 ASTER, 2002-2005 1 0.0048 115 03 Perseibreen 11 23, 1 15000 57.3 57.31 6930 7000 +700 ASTER, 2002-2004 4 0.4848 115 05 Jemelianovbreen 11 1, 5 15400 39.8 0 2230 0 -115 -100 ASTER, 2002-2004 1 0.0022 Kvastbreen 11 23 9800 8.6 0 410 0 1 0.0004 115 08 Skimebreen 11 23 6550 8.5 0 1420 0 0 ASTER, 2002-2004 1 0.0014 115 09 Davisbreen 11 9 8900 33.9 2.07 3550 900 -48 -60 ASTER, 2002-2004 2 0.0249 Tidewater glaciers of Svalbard Region 12 -SPITSBERGEN S Ident Glacier name Region Image Nb Lg [m] Ag [km 2 ] Ac [km 2 ] Ice-cliff [m] Lc [m] R1 [m] R2 [m] Front position change (years) and source Ft Qc [km 3 yr -1 ] 121 01 Crollbreen 12 9 7700 16.4 0.31 2340 250 1 0.0023 121 02 Markhambreen 12 9 8500 46.3 1.18 2080 650 -46 -50 ASTER, 2002-2004 2 0.0145 121 04 Sykorabreen 12 9 12480 57.0 1.60 1890 1000 3 0.0378 Hambergbreen 12 9 4000 34.4 4.90 2710 1700 3 0.0542 122 02 Vasilievbreen1 12 9 12400 116.4 1.78 8940 280 1 0.0089 Vasilievbreen2 12 9 9100 32.3 1.13 5610 400 2 0.0393 Vasilievbreen3 12 9 8700 18.1 0.47 3660 280 1 0.0037 123 03 Olsokbreen 12 9, 11 16600 100.2 1.63 4970 700 2 0.0348 124 04 Körberbreen 12 9 5300 7.8 0.31 1060 400 2 0.0074 124 05 Petersbreen 12 9 2280 1.1 0.03 340 100 1 0.0003 124 07 Samarinbreen 12 9 9200 60.8 2.98 3180 1000 3 0.0636 124 08 Chomjakovbreen 12 9 7200 12.1 0.39 1070 350 2 0.0075 124 09 Mendelejevbreen 12 9 10500 29.4 29.39 1820 1050 1 0.0018 124 10 Svalisbreen 12 9 11000 30.2 2.83 3020 1600 3 0.0604 124 11 Hornbreen 12 9 26230 138.7 2.65 3880 600 2 0.0271 124 12 Storbreen 12 9 22100 161.8 3.42 7690 800 2 0.0538 124 13 Hyrnerbreen 12 9 2500 4.1 0.03 920 60 1 0.0009 124 15 Wibebreen 12 9 4300 4.6 0 590 0 1 0.0006 124 16 Kvalfangarbreen 12 9 5200 12.5 0.22 1120 250 1 0.0011 124 17 Mühlbacherbreen 12 9 15700 50.2 5.83 1620 3000 3 0.0324 124 18 Paierlbreen 12 9, 10 22000 92.6 1.33 1610 2000 -106 -135 ASTER, 2004-2006 3 0.0321 124 20 Hansbreen 12 9, 10 15600 53.0 2.17\n\n1900 1400 -40 Jania (2006), 1989-2000 3 0.0381 125 03 Au Torellbreen 12 10 20800 136.2 6.04 5280 2000 -75 -120 ASTER, 2005-2006 3 0.1056 125 05 Ve Torelbreen 12 10 28700 182.9 2.31 4790 700 +80 ASTER, 2005-2006 2 0.0335 Region 13 -BELLSUND Ident Glacier name Region Image Nb Lg [m] Ag [km 2 ] Ac [km 2 ] Ice-cliff [m] Lc [m] R1 [m] R2 [m] Front position change (years) and source Ft Qc [km 3 yr -1 ] 131 16 Recherchebreen 13 10 22800 120.2 0 2110 0 -71 -50 ASTER, 2005-2006 1 0.0021 132 13 Zawadzkibreen 13 10 20000 83.1 0 1710 0 0 ASTER, 2005-2006 1 0.0017 132 14 Nathorstbreen 13 10, 9, 5, 1 25000 318.8 1.70 6230 1600 -77 Carlsen et al.
