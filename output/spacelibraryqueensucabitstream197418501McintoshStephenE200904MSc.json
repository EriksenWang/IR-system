    "abstract": "To minimize the damage caused by oil spills, responders may chemically disperse floating oil into the underlying water before it contacts shorelines and wildlife.\nQuantifying this strategy's net ecological and commercial benefits requires an analysis of its effects on subsurface ecosystems and biota. Unfortunately, spill-responders have little empirical data on which to base such an analysis. Herein I report the effects of dispersed oil to early life stages of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). Medium South American crude oil (MESA) dispersed with Corexit 9500 caused blue sac disease (BSD) in embryos, but not in free-swimming embryos. The ages of embryos were negatively correlated with their sensitivity to oil, making those that were freshly fertilized the most sensitive. However, sensitivity was also high after hatch. Free-swimming embryos displayed signs of narcosis following brief exposure to dispersed oil. Gametes were also tested; dispersed oil dramatically impaired fertilization success. Toxicity was a function of concentration and duration of exposure, as well as of the life stage exposed. When the duration of exposure was < 24 h, gametes and free-swimming embryos were the most sensitive life stages (i.e. responded to the lowest concentrations). For durations > 24 h, young embryos (< 1 day old) were most sensitive. The results are presented as toxicity models that incorporate developmental stage, oil concentration, and exposure duration.\nCurrent effects-forecasting models for oil dispersion are based on published chronic toxicity data, which do not account for the effects of exposure duration and developmental events on toxicity. Thus, the results will better-enable modelers to iii This thesis was prepared under the supervision of Dr. Peter Hodson. Dr.\nHodson's upbeat attitude, open mind, and benevolent approach to graduate supervision has been praised by all of his students, and I now welcome my chance to do the same.\nDr. Hodson's research and teaching pursuits ultimately deal with overwhelming environmental problems, yet they are steeped from the top-down in optimism and fascination. In this way, Dr. Hodson matches pragmatic applications with curiosity, and dispels defeatist reactions to complex, cross-disciplinary environmental problems. His productivity, capacity to inspire, and recognition is unsurpassed; however he observes the often unrecognized importance of humility in sustainability. Thank-you Peter, for going above and beyond to prepare me and many other students, not only for our final defenses, but also for success in our long-term professional and personal lives. I hope, especially for any of us who may supervise students in years to come, that we remember your patience and generosity in supervising us. I greatly appreciated the support, inspiration, and helpful input from the other members of my graduate committee, Dr. Stephen Brown and Dr. Simon Courtenay. Many others outside of my committee generously invested time to bring this thesis to fruition. Most notably, Dr. Dongmei Wu spent weeks assisting with experiments. Her help facilitated many investigations on free-swimming embryos of herring. Camaraderie with members of Dr. Hodson's research group brought nostalgia to long, early morning hours spent in cold wet-labs. I especially appreciated the in-depth, topical conversations I shared with many of these people. v Thanks to Colin Khan, who assisted in waterborne chemical extractions, and Dr. Jay Scott, who generously oversaw a large preliminary experiment on trout embryos.

The countermeasure battery may include chemical dispersants: products that can disperse floating oil slicks into underlying water, thereby protecting coastline resources and flagship wildlife from damage caused by oil floating at the surface. Nevertheless, while dispersing an oil spill can protect shoreline habitats from floating oil, doing so may expose sensitive forms of marine life to lethal concentrations of hydrocarbons.\n\nScientists have studied the behavior and effects of dispersed oil in marine environments for at least 40 years, yet it is far from being understood (NRC 2005). Still, oil dispersion research represents to some a line of inquiry that no longer needs answering, let alone asking (Goodman 2008). After all, in the face of a pending shoreline catastrophe, is the obvious answer not to disperse the oil into some other animal's habitat? What's the worst that could happen? I attempt to shed some light on those questions by characterizing the effects of dispersed oil to early life stages of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).\n\nSince most oil spills occur within 5 km of shore (NRC 2005), fish that spawn in relatively shallow water, such as Atlantic herring, would likely be at risk after a spill, especially when management of the spill includes dispersion. Chronic exposure tests for Atlantic herring embryos demonstrate the sensitivity of this species to dispersed oil, and underline the importance of effects testing prior to dispersant use. Tests on Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos show that the risk of a brief exposure (48 h) to CEWAF is not constant throughout early life development, but similar tests on herring have yet to be published. Since exposures to dispersed oil are relatively brief in most conditions, characterizing the effects of brief exposures is necessary to obtain a realistic idea of how a dispersed spill would affect herring. The data obtained would be most valuable when coupled with models that predict oil dispersion rates, the concentrations of hydrocarbons in the water column, and the volume of water affected under different scenarios of wind, current, and dispersant use (e.g. French-McCay 2002).\n\nGlobally, there was a tanker spill of greater volume than the Exxon Valdez spill every 8 months over the period of 1974 to 1992, not to mention frequent small-scale spills and occasional oil-well blowouts (Allison et al. 2003). Although technological and mechanical advancements have reduced the number and extent of spills (Huijer 2005; Table 1), these improvements paralleled the approximate 6-fold increase in the size of tankers over the past several decades (CEDRE 2007). This situation suggests that modern spills, though infrequent, are likely to be large. For instance, the Prestige spill in 2002 doubled the volume of oil lost during the Exxon Valdez spill in 1988. Moreover, mechanical faults are not the cause of most oil spills; human error causing collisions and accidental groundings leads to most tanker accidents (Huijer 2005).\n\nMany spills go unreported, especially those in remote areas, and estimates of the occurrence of spills based on available records may be inaccurate or misleading (Allison et al. 2003). Conflicting views of what constitutes a -major‖ spill, for example, enable different groups to present disparate trends about spills over time. According to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd. ( 2008), the frequency of oil spillage has declined to a record low, with an annual average of 3.6 major spills (>700 tons) occurring between 2000 and 2007, versus 25.2 between 1970 and 1979 (Table 1).\n\nMeanwhile, in the book -Lives by the Gallon: the True Cost of our Oil Addiction‖ (Taminen 2006) the US Department of the Interior is cited as estimating that every oil well in U.S. coastal waters (and presumably of the thousands of operational wells worldwide), -carries with it a 1 in 7 chance of a major spill (in excess of 42 000 gallons [or 136 tons] of oil)‖. Even if the definition of a major spill was normalized for each camp, there is clearly still a discrepancy in perspective.\n\nCorroborating common knowledge that oil spills degrade ecosystems, a report outlining the ramifications of the sinking of the Prestige tanker documented a general decrease in species richness of subsequently contaminated Galician beaches (de la Huz et al. 2005). Rebuttals argued that unrelated habitat changes and pollution from other sources might have occurred in the several-year gap between sampling before and after the spill, but it seems unlikely that the observed 67 % loss in species diversity was artifactual. Aquatic oil pollution is in fact causally linked to losses in biotic productivity in many habitats, ranging from shorelines and beaches to subtidal benthic communities and seagrass beds (Fayad et al. 1996).\n\nTwenty-eight day exposures show that sediment-dwelling invertebrates (as well as several other organisms) are highly sensitive to chronic oil exposure (Moles 1998).\n\nPlants are also sensitive to oil. Hose et al. (1996) noted a strong correlation between chlorophyll-deficient mutations in Puerto Rican mangrove trees and hydrocarbon concentration in the underlying sediment. Early life-stages of marine vertebrates are particularly sensitive to constituents of oil. The lowest concentration of dissolved hydrocarbons needed to kill half of the exposed Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) embryos over a course of 12 days (12 d LC50) is 1.5 ppm (Kocan et al. 1996). Much lower amounts of oil contamination can induce sublethal effects in hatched herring, ranging from bent spines to missing jaws (Hose et al. 1996). In the lab, these deformities impair individuals' motility and ability to feed (personal observation), and may do the same in nature.\n\nAs is the case for most animals, the sensitivity of fish to xenobiotics is unique for different life stages. For example, dioxin exposures that would elicit minor responses in adult fish cause pericardial and yolk sac edema, hemorrhaging (ocular, body, and yolk sac), craniofacial malformations, arrested growth, fin and spinal deformities, and mortality in the early life stages (Spitsbergen et al. 1991). These sublethal responses collectively make up a syndrome known as Blue Sac Disease (BSD).\n\nExposing fish to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can also cause BSD.\n\nPAHs comprise roughly 3 -5 % of crude oil (Khan 2008), and to a large extent give oil its toxicity (Carls et al. 1999;Ramachandran et al. 2004). They bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and are subsequently metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A enzymes (CYP1A). Most PAHs that cause BSD also generate a measurable increase in CYP1A activity in fish (Billiard et al. 2004). Early life stages of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), for example, display signs of BSD after being chronically exposed to retene (methyl isopropyl phenanthrene; an alkyl PAH). Immunohistochemical staining can be used to document the exposure-dependent activity of CYP1A and its localization to sites of pathology, implicating CYP1A-induction with PAH toxicity (Marty et al. 1997a;Brinkworth et al. 2003).\n\nWhile CYP1A can impart protection against PAHs in mice ( Uno et al. 2007), the association between CYP1A and BSD raises questions about the mechanistic relationship between CYP1A and BSD: does CYP1A induction cause BSD, or can BSD develop in the absence of CYP1A? There is evidence that both scenarios can be true. For example, the PAH benzo(a)pyrene can be biotransformed into a potent carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-8,9-epoxide by the action of the CYP1A-AhR pathway (Rand and Petrocelli 1995). Similarly, the toxicity of phenanthrene to larval trout increases when it is co-administered with the model CYP1A-inducer, β-naphthoflavone (Hawkins et al. 2002). Thus CYP1A is detrimental in this case, and may lead to an increase in BSD. The CYP1A-AhR pathway is also implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause cellular damage (Schlezinger et al. 1999) and which may be the cause of BSD (Bauder et al. 2005). CYP1A therefore appears mechanistically involved in the onset of BSD. On the other hand, knockdown of CYP1A mRNA with anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides had no effect on the toxicity of benz(a)anthracene to zebrafish (Danio rerio; Incardona et al. 2006). In addition, the onset of BSD in larval rainbow trout can be independent of CYP1A (Scott and Hodson 2008). Despite this uncertainty, to date the most responsive biomarker for exposure to PAH is CYP1A.\n\nThe complex and variable compositions of crude oils make it difficult to link particular PAHs to given effects. Khan (2008)  analyzing BSD severity of Japanese medaka larvae chronically exposed throughout embryo-larval life. Only one fraction (F3) caused BSD and increased CYP1A expression: that which contained 3-5-ringed PAHs. Waxes were precipitated out of this fraction in cold acetone, and normal phase HPLC of the toxic acetone extract (F3-1) was fractionated into F3-1-1 to F3-1-5. Of these five fractions, only the latter three, representing approximately 3% of the parent oil, led to BSD and significant CYP1A activity. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry identified the major aromatic components in these toxic fractions to be alkyl fluorenes, alkyl chrysenes, alkyl pyrenes, alkyl phenanthrenes, alkyl dibenzothiophenes, alkyl napthobenzothiophenes, and various unsubstituted PAHs. Khan's work, which was consistent with previous investigations of the toxic components of oil to fish (ex. Barron et al. 2004), can be explained by conceptualizing exposure levels in-situ for fish. While low molecular weight hydrocarbons, such as C1-C10 aliphatics can have narcotic effects, they likely do not contribute significantly to chronic toxicity because they quickly volatilize and readily dilute in water (Skadsheim et al. 2000). Meanwhile, high molar mass hydrocarbons such as waxes, resins, and asphaltenes (700 -10 000 g/mol) are generally too large and bulky to dissolve and cross biological membranes. PAHs comprise the range of 178 -350 g/mol (naphthalenebenzo(a)pyrene). At these masses, PAHs generally take on a planar conformation small enough to dissolve in water and to cross membranes, yet heavy enough to not quickly evaporate.\n\nIn terms of volume of oil discharged, the Exxon Valdez spill of 35 thousand tons paled in comparison to Atlantic Empress spill, which discharged some 287 thousand tons of crude in the Gulf of Mexico in 1979. Nevertheless, its location amid biologically productive and commercially important aquatic habitats made the Valdez one of the costliest spills to date, both ecologically (Galt et al. 1991), and financially (over 2.5 billion USD invested at time of writing, and more fines pending).\n\nAlthough the mechanisms of action of the particular toxic components of oil are not thoroughly understood, it is clear that early life stages of fish are highly sensitive to 3 -5 ringed PAHs contained in oil. Laboratory studies predating the Valdez spill demonstrated the toxicity of PAHs to early life stages of fish such as herring (Smith and Cameron 1979;Weis and Weis 1989), and the Valdez spill proved those studies to be largely consistent with field conditions. Petersen and Kristensen (1998) concluded that only 2% of herring embryos present at the time of the spill were exposed to PAH, but the effects of the spill indicated otherwise, as have other researchers. Between one and two weeks following the Valdez spill, Short and Harris (1996) recorded total PAH concentrations at depths relevant to herring spawning depths (5 -10 m) in nine locations, finding an average concentration of 6.2 ± 0.63 ppb. Embryos of some teleosts such as pink salmon can tolerate PAH concentrations upwards of 15 ppb (Heintz et al. 2000), but herring embryos are particularly sensitive to PAH, with as little as 0.4 ppb causing edema and reducing growth (Carls et al. 2002). Of the PAHs measured, a large proportion of those identified by Khan to be the most toxic (3 -5 ringed PAHs such as dibenzothiophenes) were present (Kocan et al. 1996).\n\nContamination in oiled areas of Prince William Sound was linked to ascites, pericardial edema, and genotoxicity, as well as to necrosis of skeletal myocytes, retinal cells, and developing brain cells in herring larvae that were exposed as embryos (Marty et al. 1997b). Larvae collected from oiled areas of the Sound were also shorter, and had ingested less food than larvae residing in unoiled areas. Others found that larval mortality in oiled areas of The Sound doubled that in unoiled areas (McGurk and Brown 1996). In both reports, the researchers did not acknowledge that the different early life stages of herring present at the time of the Valdez spill may have responded differently to the exposure. They instead exposed embryos and larvae chronically in an attempt to replicate field conditions. Exposing embryos for weeks to a constant concentration of hydrocarbons would not account for stage-specific differences or for the effects of briefer, more realistic exposure durations.\n\nThe toxicity to early life forms of herring was nonetheless aptly demonstrated in these investigations as well as in others (Norcross et al. 1997;Carls et al. 2000), and to a large degree, the spill's effect on herring spoke for itself. When embryos and larvae that were exposed to the Valdez spill in 1989 later returned to spawn in 1993, the spawning population was so unusually small that the Prince William Sound herring fishery collapsed indefinitely. The collapse plainly suggested that a large proportion of the early life stages exposed to oil in 1989 did not recruit into the spawning population. Both ExxonMobil and independent researchers have offered compelling arguments that the spill's role in the collapse is overestimated (Carls et al. 2002), but most of the scientific and public communities remain unconvinced (Suzuki 2009).\n\nUnfortunately, a clear-cut account of the Valdez's effects is unlikely to develop, because it is impossible to recreate the highly complex and interconnected scenario in which the spill took place. A lesson from Valdez that is clear, however, is that rapid response strategies and contingency plans must be prepared and fully investigated before spills occur. These plans are necessary to ensure that the effects of spills are predictable, and mitigated as effectively as possible in various habitats and scenarios.\n\nFloating oil can be removed from surface waters mechanically, through combustion, and/or chemically (Figure 1). Mechanical approaches involve vacuums and oil-adsorbent materials that are used to collect oil, and booms that act as floating barriers containing the slick. Boats, vacuum machines, and oil-absorbent plastic ropes can skim spilled oil from the water's surface after booms have corralled a slick. The major weakness of mechanical recovery is that the process is relatively slow and laborious. It requires access to a large inventory of equipment and professional personnel, and depends on concerted efforts of various sectors and stakeholders. Environmental conditions influence the effectiveness of the response, and must also be considered in terms of occupational safety. High wave energy, low temperatures, and remote locations are all likely to restrict mechanical recovery of oil. Additionally, recovered oil is usually extensively emulsified in water and of little commercial value. Disposal on land therefore usually follows mechanical recovery of surface oil.\n\nSlicks with a sufficiently large composition of ignitable volatiles may be burned, though combustion is never complete. Effective in-situ burning is very time-sensitive, as the more ignitable oil fractions volatilize quickly, and combustion depends on ready access to fire-proof booms. Since slicks spread quickly and extensively-one quart of oil can create a slick over a kilometre long (Taminen 2006)-combustible hydrocarbons must also be contained and thickened as much as possible immediately after the spill (Buist 2003).\n\nOil that cannot be reclaimed or burned may be chemically dispersed into the water column. Although mechanical recovery is considered the primary response option in most countries (Lessard and DeMarco 2000), dispersion has features that make it a close second in the response tool box. One of the most prominent advantages of dispersion is its ability to treat near-shore spills rapidly enough to prevent oil from contacting shorelines (Lessard and DeMarco 2000;NRC 2005). Dispersion is also suited to spills that have spread into thin surface slicks that cover large areas, making mechanical recovery difficult and inefficient (Fiocco and Lewis 1999).\n\nDespite being marred by the toxic reputation of their predecessors (see Torrey Canyon spill, 1967), modern -third generation‖ dispersants are relatively non-toxic blends of liquid surfactants and solvents (NRC 2005). The solvent component facilitates mixture of the dispersant in oil, while surfactants break down floating oil into tiny surfactant-coated oil droplets by reducing surface tension at the oil-water interface (Canevari 1978; Figure 2). Droplets that form disperse into the water column and theoretically biodegrade over time. Detailed compositions of dispersants are proprietary, but the ratios of solvents to surfactants are likely higher for dispersants designed for heavy oils and vice versa.\n\nAll dispersants have some inherent technical drawbacks. They have limited effects on certain oils (i.e. heavy oils), and must be used in precise proportions and conditions. High wave energy, for example, makes it difficult to evenly apply the dispersant, but a lack of wave energy prevents droplets from rapidly mixing into the water column. The decision to use dispersants in a particular situation cannot be put on hold, as dispersion, like mechanical recovery and in-situ burning, is the most effective option during the first one or two days after a spill. The decision to disperse the oil should thus be anticipated during the development of contingency plans.\n\nIn addition to technical factors, the decision to disperse a spill depends on the spill's surroundings. Floating slicks that threaten to contaminate shorelines, especially those that are commercially and/or ecologically important, are strong candidates for chemical dispersion. Open ocean slicks are closely monitored but rarely dispersed, as the natural environmental dispersion process accomplishes this over several weeks. Chemical dispersion moves spilled oil into subsurface habitats much more rapidly than the natural process-on the order of hours rather than weeks. This high dispersion rate means that marine organisms in the path of chemically dispersed plumes are exposed to much higher concentrations of hydrocarbons than they would be during a natural dispersion process. The effects of exposing subsurface marine life and seabeds to dispersed oil therefore must also be considered before deciding to disperse a spill. The duration of this exposure depends on environmental factors that control the underwater movement of the dispersed plume. In shallow waters and/or those with poor circulation, a dispersed plume would likely expose aquatic organisms to high concentrations of oil for a significant period of time, as may have been the case with dispersed portions of the Valdez spill. In contrast, dispersion in more suitable conditions may occur in less than 24 h (French-McCay 2002;Lessard and DeMarco 2000), which proponents of dispersantuse consider a non-toxic exposure duration (Lessard and DeMarco 2000;Fiocco and Lewis 1999).\n\nDecisions to disperse a spill may be rooted in additional factors unrelated to efficacy or ecological costs/benefits. The visible effects of oil pollution on shorelines and flagship wildlife generate prolific headlines that degrade national images and important economic sectors alike. As a result, political and socio-economic pressures may also play a role in decisions to disperse a spill into the water column (and away from the view of the public eye).\n\nIn much of the United States, inclusion of dispersants in contingency plans has been approved, and their use (whether planned or not) is usually pre-approved (NRC 2005). Policies on dispersant-use may be even less prudent in developing nations; multinational oil companies operating in Nigeria were encouraged to use dispersants well before the development of third generation dispersant formulations (Oyewo 1986). In Canada, alleviation of restrictions on dispersant-use awaits further toxicological assessment of dispersed oil in cold waters (NRC 2005). Even in countries where dispersion is the primary response strategy, the use of dispersants remains controversial. Fiocco and Lewis (1999) sum up the so-called -dispersant debate‖ with the rather misrepresentative arguments quoted in Table 2, along with some additional perspectives.\n\nWhile modern dispersants such as Corexit 9500 and Dasic Slickgone NS are far less toxic than their predecessors, they are nonetheless far from being non-toxic to sensitive marine organisms such as corals (George-Ares and Clark 2000; Mitchell and Holdway 2000;Fuller et al. 2004). In addition, the low toxicity of dispersant molecules to fish hinges on their ability to be sequestered in oil droplets (Ramachandran 2005). An example is the low toxicity of dispersant/mineral oil mixtures to medaka compared to dispersant alone (Ramachandran 2005). Practically, this means that if in attempting to disperse a spill, a spill responder misses the slick and adds dispersant to unoiled water, the dispersant could present unexpected toxicity and worsen the situation.\n\nModern dispersants are superior to earlier variants not only in terms of toxicity.\n\nModern examples are also more effective, as demonstrated in the Sea Empress experience in the UK (1996), and the more conclusive North Sea trials in 1997, which identified Corexit 9500 as the dispersant of choice (Lewis et al. 1998). Nevertheless, even the planned experimental discharges in the North Sea were subject to technical problems (inappropriate dispersant:oil dosing, logistical difficulties, and mechanical issues with the spray apparatus on an aircraft) that limited the success of at least one of the three experimental dispersions (Lewis et al. 1998). If such complications arise when attempting to disperse planned and controlled discharges, it is easy to be skeptical of the success of dispersing accidental spills. Other experimental and unplanned experiences (1997 Evoikos Spill in Singapore [Siang 1998], 1981 study in Searsport, Maine [Gilfillan et al. 1985]), as well as the usefulness of dispersants in near-shore applications (Lessard and DeMarco 2000) largely silence that skepticism. However, periodic examples (-TROPICS‖ experiments [Ballou et al. 1989]; ineffectiveness of dispersions in the Exxon Valdez experience) revive it, making it difficult to be completely certain about the efficacy of a dispersion operation. The most uncertainty revolves around the question, what is the risk of dispersed oil to marine resources (NRC 2005)?\n\nThe toxicity of dispersed oil depends on its exposure concentrations and durations in the water column. While trajectory models are useful for surface water and shoreline planning activities, these earlier models (circa mid 1990s) fail to predict subsurface oil exposure levels, as demonstrated by their inability to predict the extensive biological damage of the North Cape spill near Rhode Island, USA in January 1996 (French-McCay et al. 1999). More recent models, such as OilToxEx (French-McCay 2002), are therefore designed to predict surface, shoreline, as well as subsurface exposure levels in time and space. Rates and amounts of shoreline stranding, surface spreading and evaporation, emulsification, subsurface entrainment into droplets, and dissolution from droplets and the surface are all outputs of modern oil spill models. They also attempt to predict rates of sediment adsorption and degradation of entrained and dissolved oil. To predict these variables, wind, current, and tidal conditions, as well as the volume and type of oil spilled and the duration of its release must be known (French-McCay et al. 1999). In the wake of the movement to improve the subsurface exposure information provided by models, a further push was made to incorporate the potential action of dispersants. Ensuing innovations such as SIMAP (French-McCay 2001) were designed to predict both surface and subsurface movements of dispersed oil.\n\nIn order to connect the oil entrainment and dissolution outputs to ecological effects, information about the locations and types of shorelines around spill sites, as well as a comprehensive map of subsurface habitats are necessary. In deep waters where species abundance is relatively low, dissolved aromatics may not cause significant ecological impacts if dilution is rapid (French-McCay 2001). Most spills occur close to shorelines though (NRC 2005), and a hypothetical dispersed spill scenario 25 km from the entrance of Galveston Bay TX (15 m depth-consistent with herring spawning habitats), for example, would have the potential to devastate aquatic biota and fisheries in particular conditions (French-McCay 2001). The enhanced SIMAP model also indicates that the latency of dispersion is critical to the toxicity of the dispersed fraction: the more dispersant and the sooner that it is applied (i.e. the less the spill is weathered and voided of toxic volatiles), the more water column impact. In the example of Galveston Bay, the most subsurface ecological losses would occur if the spill was weathered < 7 h.\n\nFor the same example, the SIMAP model predicted that dissolved PAH concentrations around the hypothetical spill could reach 64 ppb for > 96 h, which may encompass the LC50s for early life stages of herring. The chronic EC50 of total hydrocarbons for BSD is 1 ppm for herring embryos (Sweezey 2005). Assuming that the toxicity of oil to herring embryos is due to its PAH content (roughly 3 % of the total hydrocarbons in oil (Khan 2008), the EC50 of PAHs for herring embryos can be calculated to be approximately 30 ppb. If toxicity is assumed to be uniformly additive over the duration of embryonic life (12 days), the 96 h (or 4 d) LC50 would be approximately 90 ppb, which is not much greater than the PAH concentration estimated in Galveston Bay.\n\nExposure durations corresponding to toxic concentrations of dispersed oil have not been studied using early life stages of herring. Durations of exposure other than 96 h are possible and can be predicted by the models; however, modeling the effects of other exposure durations awaits toxicity testing to determine lethal and sublethal concentrations that correspond to those durations. Models that predict the effects of different exposure scenarios currently bypass much of this toxicity testing, using assumptions that have yet to be validated. The OilToxEx and SIMAP models estimate biotic losses after predicting exposure durations and concentrations. Without reporting these exposure characteristics, the models estimate biotic losses based on published incipient LC50s (the LC50s for infinite exposure durations) of target species. While this feature makes the models applicable to numerous species, it trades off specificity to various spill circumstances.\n\nRather than estimating the effects of various exposures based on an incipient LC50, the present study empirically elucidates the effects of realistic exposure regimes to early life stages of herring. Conversely, OilToxEx predicts the toxicity of various exposure regimes to herring by applying theoretical toxicity models (toxicokinetics and quantitative structure-activity relationships) to one incipient LC50. This approach clearly assumes more than an empirical model, but boasts more applicability and utility in a realistic oil spill scenario, where not only herring are affected.\n\nWhich system is best: experimentally determined responses, or theoretically modeled responses? Empirical data are likely more accurate, but seldom available, hence the need for theoretical models. However, where data are made available, as is the case in this thesis for early life stages of herring, oil spill models should provide an option to report estimates of exposure concentrations and durations. One could compare these estimates with empirical toxicity data to predict effects with fewer assumptions. In the case of species whose incipient LC50 has been determined in lieu of studying their specific responses to various exposure regimes (the norm), the current OilToxEx model would be most appropriate. Thus, the answer is that empirical and theoretical systems working in concert would represent the best approach to modeling the effects of oil spills. Lessard and DeMarco (2000) claim that in the first hour following a typical dispersion application, total hydrocarbon concentrations range from 40 -60 ppm in the first 10 m of subsurface water, but quickly dilute to 1 ppm within five hours. On this basis, the ExxonMobil affiliates claim that marine currents quickly distribute the oil droplets into the water column before significant harm can occur to marine life. They fail to mention that those concentrations and durations of exposure vary depending on the type and volume of oil spilled, as well as on wind and current speed, wave action, and vertical mixing energy. Moreover, the subsurface concentrations estimated by Lessard and DeMarco are not necessarily ecologically safe. LC50s range from 5 to 400 ppb for 95 % of species exposed to PAH mixtures for over 96 h (French-McCay 2002). As mentioned, PAHs make up roughly 3% of crude oil (Khan 2008), and are some of its most soluble components. Therefore it can be estimated that 3 % (or 30 ppb) of a 1 ppm total waterborne hydrocarbon concentration following an oil spill would likely be made up of PAHs. Depending on the duration of exposure, this concentration could be considerably toxic. The presence of 28 ppb dissolved PAHs at virtually any water depth several months after the Prestige oil spill in 2002 (Gonzalez et al. 2006) testified that marine life can face formidable durations of exposure to PAHs after a spill.\n\nChemically dispersed oil is thought to be broken down by bacteria faster than mechanically dispersed oil (Lessard and DeMarco 2000). This may explain the expedience of remediation after the largely dispersed Sea Empress spill, relative to the non-dispersed Prestige spill. However, the latter was a much larger spill, and conditions specific to the spill sites inevitably played a role in the persistence of dissolved oil. Lessard and DeMarco (2000) also claimed that dispersants prevent oil from sticking to the bottom of the sea, because the surface activity of dispersants makes droplets more compatible with water. An alternative perspective is that dispersion reduces the buoyancy of oil as low-density constituents partition more rapidly out of droplets than out of surface films. Suspended particulate matter likely acts as a vehicle to transport dispersed droplets into sediments, and warrants consideration prior to dispersion.\n\nAfter a typical spill, a water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil is naturally dispersed by the mixing action of waves (Fiocco and Lewis 1999). Adding chemical dispersants to a slick enables additional oil to mix into the water column in the form of dispersant-coated droplets (Figure 2). Oil that is dispersed into water contains both WAF and these dispersed droplets, which together make up what is known as the chemically enhanced, water-accommodated fraction (CEWAF). The preparation of WAF and CEWAF is standardized for toxicity testing according to Singer et al. (2000).\n\nIn essence, adding dispersant to floating oil increases the concentration of hydrocarbons in the underlying water. Hence it is little surprise that, as a consequence of increased hydrocarbon exposure, the chronic toxicity of a particular volume of CEWAF to embryos and free-swimming embryos of estuarine mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), freshwater medaka (Oryzias latipes), trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Atlantic herring (Clupea herangus) is greater than the toxicity of the same volume of WAF (Couillard et al. 2005;Ramachandran 2005;Clarke 2005;Sweezey 2005; Table 3).\n\nFor example, adding 1 ml CEWAF of MESA to tanks of herring was 100x more toxic than adding 1 ml WAF of MESA; however, adding 100 ml of medium South American crude oil (MESA) WAF had the same effect as adding 1 ml of CEWAF (Sweezey 2005).\n\nThis relationship suggests that the constituents of CEWAF are not more toxic or different from the constituents of the WAF, but that the toxic constituents contained in WAF are 100 times more concentrated in CEWAF.\n\nOthers have arrived at a similar conclusion through studies on different species, life stages, crude oils, dispersants, and experimental endpoints (Barron et al. 2004;Cohen et al. 2001;Clark et al. 2001). Nevertheless, the difference in the quantity of toxic hydrocarbons between WAF and CEWAF is not 100-fold for all types of crude oils and petroleum products. Table 3 shows that the difference is consistently 100-fold for MESA and in that range for Alaskan North Slope Crude, Scotian Light crude oil, and diesel, but closer to 1000-fold for Terra Nova crude oil.\n\nIn summary, it appears that hydrocarbons in WAF and CEWAF significantly differ in concentration, but not in inherent toxicity. Dispersion therefore does not affect the mechanism or toxicity of oil constituents as significantly as it affects the concentration of hydrocarbons in water.\n\nIn a realistic scenario of a dispersed slick, exposures to CEWAF in the water column are thought to be short (< 72 h; Fiocco and Lewis 1999;Lewis et al. 1998). An exception may be exposures to life forms whose motility is dominated by water currents (i.e. free-swimming fish embryos). Once entrained in a moving plume of CEWAF, they may be stuck in it for days, but eggs fixed on substrata or fish capable of chemotaxis are not likely to move with a plume. Traditional toxicity tests based on 96 h or 10 -20 d exposure regimes may therefore be unrealistic and overly conservative. Sprague (1969) has long advocated the inclusion of realistic exposure durations in toxicity tests to estimate threshold or median effect concentrations. Unfortunately, few studies with short exposure durations have been published for CEWAF.\n\nSince most oil spills occur within 5 km of shore (NRC 2005), early life stages of fish such as Atlantic herring, which reside in relatively shallow shelf regions, would likely be at risk after a spill. Although this risk would compound if the spill was dispersed, proximity to shoreline resources would make dispersion a probable management strategy. Multiple tanker routes transect Atlantic herring spawning habitats, annually transporting a billion tons of crude oil to ports along Eastern North America.\n\nInterest in characterizing the effects of CEWAF to early life stages of herring has thus developed.\n\nAfter 19 d of exposure to MESA CEWAF, Sweezey (2005) observed signs of BSD in Atlantic herring exposed to as little as 0.032 % (v/v), measured by fluorescence spectrometry to contain about 0.5 ppm of total hydrocarbons. This work should be repeated to determine the effects of more realistic short-duration exposures to CEWAF (< 96 h) that are likely to occur after dispersion of a spill (French-McCay 2002).\n\nUnpublished tests on medaka (Ramachandran 2005) show that the risk of a brief exposure to CEWAF is significant. Kocan et al. (1996) found that hydrocarbon exposure can induce Pacific herring embryos to produce chorion-dissolving -hatching enzymes‖, leading to premature hatchings (not tested in this study). CEWAF had this effect on Atlantic herring embryos (Sweezey 2005). While premature hatching seems disadvantageous (Villalobos et al. 2000), it is interesting to note that hatched embryos may have some ability to move away from a contaminated area.\n\nIn addition to concentration of exposure, the toxicity of dispersed oil is a function of the life stage of the species exposed to it. Of all life stages of fish, the early developmental stages are the most relevant and important for testing the effects of dispersed oil on fish. Dense localization and low motility make early life stages vulnerable to oil exposure after a spill. Moreover, the toxicity of oil to fish increases with factors that increase their exposure to the toxic components of oil, and dispersant is one such factor. The sensitivity of these stages to low exposure concentrations is well documented (Clark et al. 2001;Coutou 2001), and experience with the Valdez spill demonstrated the connection between the health of early life stages and the sustainability of adult populations and fisheries, as do reviews of toxicity tests (Lusin and DeVries 1997).\n\nSince the risk of oil toxicity is a function of developmental stage (Ramachandran 2005), assessing the risk of dispersed oil to fish, by convention, should not be based on one or two life stages, especially if those stages are known to be the least sensitive.\n\nNevertheless, most toxicity data describe the acute lethality of dispersed oil to juvenile or adult fish, which are generally the least sensitive life stages.\n\nThe European Centre for Ecological Toxicology and Toxicity of Chemicals (ECETOC) Aquatic Toxicity Database shows that larvae tend to be more sensitive than embryos, and that embryo-larval stages are more sensitive than juveniles and adults (the latter being the least sensitive; reviewed by Hutchinson et al. 1998). However, this is not the case for all species and all substances tested, and this trend applies only to chronic exposures. It also appears as though hatched embryos are automatically considered larvae in the database, but for many species they may actually be free-swimming embryos. Nevertheless, the database confirms the existence of stage-specific sensitivities and reveals a general trend of decreasing sensitivity with age.\n\nThe negative correlation between sensitivity and age does not appear to be linear; discrete phases of extraordinary sensitivity exist within the early life stages of many common test species (Ramachandran 2005;Hamm and Hinton 2000;Segnera et al. 2003;Sharp and Neff 1982;Hutchinson et al. 1998;Villalobos et al. 2000;Liu et al. 2002).\n\nHowever, researchers studying stage-specific differences in fish often examine differences between large sections of fish life cycles, such as fertilization until swim-up, swim-up until gonadal development, and so on (e.g. Segnera et al. 2003). These experimental designs indicate that the process of identifying discrete windows of sensitivity within fish life-cycles is still at its infancy.\n\nIronically, of the few articles that describe discrete stage-specific differences in the sensitivities of fish, some were published decades ago. For example, Sharp and Neff (1982) found that embryos of the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus decreased in sensitivity after exposing 0, 1, 2, and 5-day-old embryos to mercuric chloride derivatives for 4 d.\n\nThey identified the 0-day-old embryos as the most sensitive. Zero-day old embryos were then exposed for 1 d rather than 4 d. As expected, reducing the duration of exposure increased survivorship; however, this increase was very modest. The insignificant effect of increasing the duration of exposure suggested that the most critical window of sensitivity for Fundulus embryos is discrete, and occurs at some point within 0-1 dpf.\n\nIf this sensitivity is consistent for other species, studies that fail to include the first 24 h of embryonic life in exposures may overlook potentially high sensitivity during this time. Many investigations run this risk. Even modern toxicological tests, specifically designed to examine changes in sensitivity of embryos as they age, omit potentially critical windows of development. For instance, Hamm and Hinton (2000) exposed medaka to diazinon for 4 d beginning 1, 3, and 5 dpf (stage 11: multicellular; stage 23: initiation of heartbeat; and stage 29: advances in vasculature, respectively). Although percent mortality was significantly higher for embryos exposed 1 dpf compared to those exposed 3 or 5 dpf, the observed negative correlation between age and sensitivity may have been stronger had the 0 dpf period been included.\n\nThere are very few fish toxicology studies to date that compare the sensitivity of pre-and post-fertilization life stages. A noteworthy example tested the toxicity of waterborne hydrocarbons to unfertilized Pacific herring eggs via a parental exposure pathway (Carls et al. 1999). The researchers confined gravid Pacific herring in water containing weathered crude oil, in turn exposing unfertilized eggs to a PAH concentration of 10 µg/g in ovo. The eggs reportedly did not respond to this concentration, but herring embryos (i.e. fertilized eggs) displayed significant signs of toxicity after being exposed to the much lower waterborne concentrations of PAHs (Carls et al. 2000). Carls et al. (2000) reasoned that the unfertilized eggs were exposed to less toxic PAHs (primarily naphthalenes; 84-92 %) due to metabolic partitioning of PAHs in parental tissues. Still, the authors concluded that -embryos are more critically sensitive to oil pollution than are gametes‖.\n\nMechanistic causes of stage-specific differences in sensitivities are largely theoretical. Evidence suggests that AhR-mediated chemical metabolism and cellular oxidative stress play roles. Guiney et al. (1997) reported that lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) early life stages exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) express dramatically different amounts of CYP1A, ranging from no expression in young embryos to maximum in sac fry. Wiegand et al. (1999) concluded that the high cellular energy demands of growth and organogenesis limit the resources available for the production of detoxifying enzymes such as CYP1A, a lack of which would slow excretion of AhR ligands. In agreement, Brinkworth et al. (2003) suggested Cyp1a genes activate during organogenesis, several days after fertilization. Thus lipophilic AhR ligands may accumulate for days without CYP1A-mediated excretion. With the onset of CYP1A production, a large amount of sequestered AhR ligands may be rapidly detoxified, potentially leading to a large amount of ROS by-products associated with both CYP1A-mediated metabolism (Schlezinger et al. 1999) and oil toxicity (Bauder et al. 2005).\n\nAs fish age, their oxidative defense improves. In embryos, however, antioxidation may depend exclusively on superoxide dismutase, which acts only on O 2 -, and not H 2 O 2 or other ROS (Peters and Livingstone 1996). Unfortunately, metabolism of PAHs can produce various ROS, including H 2 O 2 (Schlezinger et al. 1999). Therefore the toxicity of xenobiotics, such as PAHs, to early life stages of fish may be linked to a lack of oxidative defense in those stages. This logic suggests that widespread selective pressure to juxtapose the production of CYP1A and antioxidants in embryos has not existed on an evolutionary time scale. Petersen and Kristensen (1996) offered other explanations for the sensitivity of early life stages to toxicants such as PAHs. They noted significantly lower uptake and elimination rates of 14 C-labeled PAHs by zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) embryos compared to larvae. This observation caused the researchers to conclude that stagespecific changes in sensitivity to PAHs correlate to changes in bioconcentration kinetics.\n\nThe chorion and its development may also explain changes in sensitivity during early ontogeny. Blaxter (1988) reported that after fertilization, embryos undergo a waterhardening process that significantly decreases the permeability of the chorion to waterborne substances. Thus, the protective role of the hardened chorion could explain differences between the sensitivities of young and old embryos to toxic compounds. This logic is compelling, but has not been rigorously tested.\n\nA pertinent study compared the toxicity of the herbicidal carbamate, Thiobencarb to chorionated and dechorionated medaka embryos, with exposure beginning at the midgastrula stage (Villalobos et al. 2000). As expected, the dechorionated embryos were more sensitive, but not by much; the LC50 for dechorionated embryos was approximately half that of chorionated embryos. This result implicated the chorion with changes in sensitivity during embryonic development; however, it also showed that dechorionation would not account for changes in sensitivity greater than 2-fold. In addition, dechorionation caused a 10 % decrease in the -normal activity‖ of Medaka embryos. This observation makes the protective role of the chorion less clear: did the change in normal activity lead to the sensitivity, or was it a direct result of dechorionation? Furthermore, Thiobencarb caused significantly more morphological abnormalities (severe pericardial edema, skeletal malformations, other signs of BSD) in chorionated embryos than in dechorionated embryos.\n\nOther theories may explain the differential responses to chemicals throughout embryonic life. A key difference between 0-day-old embryos and older ones is that young embryos are much less differentiated than older ones. The extracellular environments of these pluripotent cells act as templates to guide their differentiation and growth into tissues. Toxicants may cause physical and/or chemical changes to extracellular matrices of 0-day-old embryos, and thereby cause inappropriate cellular changes that manifest signs of toxicity. Meanwhile, terminally differentiated cells can produce phenotypically identical daughter cells in an imperfect extracellular environment (Lannan et al. 1984). Hence, older embryos (> 1 dpf) may respond to changes in their extracellular surroundings to a lesser extent due to their greater degree of differentiation.\n\nAdditionally, all three germ layers-ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm-may be affected in early development, but to a lesser extent in older embryos. Older embryos are surrounded by ectoderm-derived tissues that may protect the core tissues from direct exposure; however, the ectoderm may take several hours after fertilization to surround the other germ layers. This logic suggests that in early embryos, cell lines for various tissues and organs may be directly exposed to waterborne contaminants.\n\nOther explanations for changes in sensitivity may also be true, and as is the case in most complex biological systems, several factors probably contribute to an effect.\n\nWhile the mechanistic underpinnings of stage-specific sensitivities are not unanimous, they enable educated extensions to be made among species and chemicals. In other words, they are a basis on which to expect stage-specific sensitivities of species that have yet to be examined for these stage effects.\n\nDespite the toxicologically important differences among life stages, differences in the toxicities of chemicals are not often attributed to stage-specific differences in exposed organisms, even if different stages are used in chemical testing. For instance, the toxicities of the Corexit dispersants currently approved for use in the United States are cited by NRC (2005) with respect to LC/EC50, various acute and chronic durations of exposure, and dozens of species of cnidarians, crustaceans, molluscs, algae, seagrasses, bacteria, and fish. However, little attention is given to stage-specific differences in sensitivities of these organisms. Although the authors sporadically describe the stage(s) exposed as embryo, larvae, or embryo-larvae, they do not mention the period of acute exposure within the 10 -20 d period of embryonic life, and even longer larval life stages.\n\nEven reviews specifically intended to evaluate the usefulness of early life stages in toxicity testing make similar generalizations about life stages, stating for example that embryo-larval and early juvenile stages are the most sensitive, and are thus useful in estimating the maximum acceptable concentrations of toxicants (McKim 1977). While it may go without saying for some, it is imperative to convey the idea that such remarks apply only to chronic tests that compare exposures starting and ending at exactly the same time. In other words, embryo-larval studies that chronically expose 5-day-old embryos to a chemical are not necessarily as informative or comparable to embryo-larval exposures that commence immediately after fertilization. The former experimental design may overlook the most sensitive period of development of a species, and thus underestimate the toxicity of a chemical. If comparing this chemical to others that were tested using the latter experimental design, it may be wrongly classified as less toxic.\n\nMany major publications make these generalizations about ontogeny in toxicity testing. Henry et al. (1997) exposed zebrafish embryos from 12 -240 h postfertilization to TCDD. The first 12 h of life were therefore ignored, yet there is no reason to believe that this initial developmental phase is irrelevant to TCDD toxicity to fish embryos. The study aptly described the responses of zebrafish chronically exposed to TCDD from 12 to 240 h post-fertilization, but it did not fulfill the authors' claim that it was a thorough foundation on which to build an understanding of TCDD toxicity to the early life stages of zebrafish. In order to understand the toxicity of a compound to a certain life stage, one must keep in mind that the effects of the compound can change throughout the stage.\n\nIn summation, toxicity testing should consider stage-specific differences in the sensitivities of test organisms, which could otherwise be mistaken for differences in toxicities of chemicals. There have been many reports of a negative correlation between embryonic age and sensitivity to xenobiotics (Hamm and Hinton 2000;Segnera et al. 2003;Sharp and Neff 1982;Hutchinson et al. 1998;Villalobos et al. 2000;Liu et al. 2002), and an increase in sensitivity after hatch (Hutchinson et al. 1998). However, few researchers have set out to identify discrete windows of critical sensitivity in the early life histories of fish. Certainly, the literature lacks studies that characterize stage-specific sensitivities of teleosts in terms of both exposure duration and concentration. Finally, no known publications have described the stage-specific toxicity of CEWAF to fish.\n\nMy objective was to identify early life stages of Atlantic herring that are the most sensitive to dispersed oil, and to assess the effect of exposure duration, oil concentration, and life stage on dispersed oil toxicity. Exposure regimes were designed to simulate realistic oil dispersion scenarios. By characterizing the toxicity of CEWAF during windows of developmental sensitivity, the project rectified a long-standing lack of data regarding the lowest acceptable exposure conditions of dispersed oil to newly spawned fish.\n\nThe null hypotheses were: toxicity is not exposure-dependent, and sensitivity to dispersed oil is consistent throughout development. Differences in sensitivity were expected on the basis of physiological differences among the life stages, and literature reviews of stage-dependant sensitivities of aquatic animals (Hutchinson et al. 1998).\n\nExposure duration and toxicity correlate for numerous species and chemicals, including hydrocarbons and PAHs (Baussant et al. 2001;Anderson et al. 1980;Rossi and Anderson 1976). I expected a similar relationship between exposure duration and toxicity of CEWAF to early life stages of herring. Likewise, responses were expected to be concentration-dependent.\n\nStatistical models were developed to describe the relationships among life stage, exposure duration, and concentration of dispersed oil causing lethal and sublethal effects.\n\nThese models may provide policy makers and spill managers with a more complete understanding of the risks of dispersed oil to newly-spawned fish, thereby reducing the uncertainty associated with dispersant use.  The active ingredients of dispersants are surfactants, which 2) align their hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in the water and oil, respectively. 3) Repulsive forces between oil and water are buffered by the surfactant molecules. With the assistance of wave energy, tiny droplets (1 -70 µm in diameter) form and disperse. Table 2. The dispersant debate portrayed by Fiocco and Lewis (1999). The first two columns are quoted directly from Fiocco and Lewis (1999).  CEWAF was prepared according to Ramachandran et al. (2004) with one major modification: dispersant was added to the oil-water mixture at a ratio of 1 part dispersant / 10 parts oil, rather than 1 part dispersant / 20 parts oil (as recommended by Gagnon and Holdway 2000). This increase in dispersant concentration increased the total hydrocarbon content (THC) of the resulting CEWAF by approximately 50 %, but further increases in THC demanded disproportionately higher amounts of dispersant (Appendix A: Figures A2 and A3). Thus, by generating a more concentrated stock solution, this modified mixing ratio conserved chemicals and space without requiring excess dispersant. In the field, recommended oil to dispersant ratios may be 1:10 or higher depending on environmental conditions and responders' discretion (EPA 1995;Epstein et al. 2000;NRC 2005).\n\nEarly life stages of herring are difficult to collect from their marine habitats, so landed adults of at least 25 cm fork length and stage VI of sexual maturity (described in Landry and McQuinn 1988) were obtained for viable gametes. Herring spawning locations vary from year to year (Power et al. 2007a). Sources of sexually mature herring in Canadian waters currently occur throughout the New Brunswick, Scotian, Northumberland, and Newfoundland shelf regions (Appendix A: Table A1, Figures A4 and A5). Collected herring were spatially and temporally distinct spawners (i.e. some were caught in autumn from Eastern NS while others were caught in Northern NB in spring); however, differences in physical attributes or responses to CEWAF were not observed.\n\nTwenty ripe female and male herring gonads were received on September 26, 2007 from Eastern Shore, NS, and on May 13, 2008 from Escuminac, NB.\n\nApproximately half of the gonads of each sex were left in-vivo, while the remainder were excised and stored in sealed glass Mason jars. All were shipped in coolers with freezer packs from sea to Queen's University in Kingston, ON via air cargo within about 14 h of landing (15 -22 h of catch). Milt is more amenable to transportation and storage than eggs (Blaxter 1953), having little effect on the quality of zygote. Excised testes were thus pooled in one Mason jar. In contrast, all ovaries were stored separately and used for separate replicates to account for variable egg qualities throughout experimentation. The storage method (in-situ or in Mason jars) had no discernable effect on the quality of gametes, but excising and storing the gonads out of the herring carcasses improved their longevity. The viability of gametes decreased with time until approximately 4 d postcatch, at which point they were no longer useful. Dinnel (2005) provides a helpful guide to herring acquisition for bioassays.\n\nThe optimum tested salinity for fertilization was 15 ‰ (Appendix A: Figure A6), which is consistent with that for Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) from San Francisco Bay, and about twice that for herring residing in the Baltic Sea (Clupea harengus membras; Griffin et al. 1998). Tolerance of non-optimal salinity was significantly higher for Atlantic herring than for Pacific or Baltic Sea herring (Griffin et al. 1998).\n\nFifteen ‰ artificial saltwater was prepared using Kent Sea Salt (Kent Marine Inc., Georgia, USA) and water from Lake Ontario (alkalinity = 90 mg/L CaCO 3 ). The water was cooled to 10°C, and with the exception of final scoring, all experimental procedures took place at 10°C with a 2:22 h dim lighting to darkness photoperiod. Semen was expressed from testes diluted in salt water to a concentration of 5 ‰ v/v. Approximately 50 to 75 eggs from the ripest excised ovaries were expressed over the bottoms of 50 ml Petri dishes containing 30 ml salt water. Enough dishes were prepared to provide three replicates for each exposure, using the eggs from a different female for each replicate.\n\nOne ml of milt was subsequently added to each Petri dish. After 1 h, the milt solutions were decanted. Since the eggs adhered to the dishes, it was possible to gently rinse them three times with salt water before being refilled with 30 ml saltwater. The comparatively low milt density and higher milt-egg contact time allowed high fertilization success (95 %) shared by other methods that used higher sperm concentrations (Rosenthal et al. 1998). This method also reduced the residual milt in contact with eggs and the container, and the risk of fungal contamination.\n\nAbout five hours passed before eggs could be identified as fertilized or unfertilized. Unfertilized eggs, distinguishable by their undifferentiated appearance and lack of chorionation (Appendix A: Figure A7), were dislodged and rinsed from the Petri dishes.\n\nTo determine if eggs can be fertilized in the presence of dispersed oil, 0.0032 -3.2 % v/v CEWAF was spiked into the milt solution before the milt was added to Petri dishes containing eggs. After 1 h the milt/CEWAF solutions were exchanged with clean saltwater and the eggs were rinsed in accordance with the fertilization procedure. At least 5 h later, the percentage of fertilized eggs in each Petri dish was recorded, and the average fertilization success associated with each CEWAF exposure concentration was calculated.\n\nIn all embryo exposures, test solutions and water controls were renewed daily until time of hatch (approximately 12 dpf), at which time individuals were anesthetized (Tricaine Methanesulfonate 100 mg/l, Argent Laboratories Can., Richmond, BC) and responses quantified. Renewal volumes were 95% throughout.\n\nFor the first set of exposures, groups of 25 healthy, fertilized eggs were placed, unbound to one another, in 500 ml glass Mason jars with 200 ml aerated saltwater.\n\nEnough jars were prepared for triplicate semi-static, daily renewal exposures of 1 % and 0.32 % CEWAF, beginning on each day of embryonic life (0 -11 dpf) and lasting 48 h.\n\nEggs from a different female herring were used for each replicate. The embryo age, zero dpf, was considered to start 5 h after fertilization, and 1 dpf started 24 h thereafter. This range finder experiment was later refined to expose 0 -5 and 11-day-old embryos to a broader range of CEWAF concentrations (0.032 -3.2 % v/v) for 48 h, and to assess both lethal and sublethal effects (i.e. signs of BSD). Assessment of CEWAF toxicity to 0-and 1-day-old embryos was refined by varying exposure durations from 1 -144 h. While the methodology was otherwise consistent with the previous two experiments, time constraints required that embryos be exposed to CEWAF directly in the Petri dishes in which they were originally fertilized, rather than being transferred to Mason jars for exposure. Enough eggs were removed from each Petri dish until only 20 fertilized eggs, free from contact with one another, adhered to the bottom of each dish. CEWAF was spiked into 30 ml of daily renewed saltwater contained in each dish to create exposure concentrations from 0.01 -3.2 % v/v; solutions were renewed daily. Exposure durations ranged from 1 -144 h. Spiking occurred immediately after daily renewals (every 24 h for exposures ≥ 48 h). After hatch, mortality and sublethal responses (BSD) were quantified.\n\nThe final part of the experiment exposed newly hatched, free-swimming embryos to CEWAF in aerated 2 L stainless steel bowls, using a daily semi-static renewal design.\n\nGroups of 10 free-swimming embryos were exposed in triplicate to CEWAF concentration and duration series of 0.00032 -3.2 % v/v, and 1 -144 h, respectively, during which cumulative mortality was monitored. Water chemistry for all experiments was measured every second day to ensure conditions were within a suitable range (temperature: 8.8 ± 0.3°C; dissolved oxygen: 98.9 ± 5.5 %; pH = 7.8 ± 0.3; conductivity 23.9 ± 1.8 mS/cm).\n\nUsing a rating system from 0 (minimum) to 3 (maximum), each individual was assessed for pericardial and yolk sac edemas (PE, YE), spinal curvature (SC), and swimming ability (SA). Individuals that moved very little, even when prodded had SA scores of 0-1; faster and more frequent swimmers had scores of 2-3. Craniofacial malformation (CF) and fin rot (FR) were rated categorically as 0 (absent) or 1 (present). The percent mortality of exposed embryos was calculated by dividing the number of dead individuals by the total number of individuals exposed. The number of surviving fish displaying no signs of BSD was divided by the total number of living individuals to calculate % normal. Thus, while % mortality tallied lethal effects of exposure, % normal counted only sublethal signs of toxicity, and BSD severity index incorporated both lethal and sublethal effects.\n\nDaily, 1.5 ml samples from exposure solutions were diluted by 50 % with ethanol, and stored at 4°C in scintillation vials (7 ml) before being analyzed by scanning spectrofluorimetry (Quanta-Master Fluorescence Spectrometer; Photon Technology International Ltd., London, ON). The excitation and emission light wavelengths were 297 nm and 356 nm, respectively. Fluorescence of solutions excited at 297 nm was measured at emission wavelengths of 305 -480 nm (excitation scan). Fluorescence of solutions excited at 356 nm was measured for emission wavelengths of 220 -350 nm.\n\nFelix software (Photon Technology International Ltd., London, ON) was used to integrate the excitation and emission curves of each sample, along with a standard curve of MESA diluted in ethanol.\n\nAn analysis of PAH and total hydrocarbon content in the exposure containers was also carried out. One L samples of CEWAF (0.1 % and 1 % v/v) were taken at times 0 and 24 hours after spiking with CEWAF. A surrogate standard solution was prepared\n\ngravimetrically from deuterium-labeled naphthalene d-8, acenaphthene d-10, phenanthrene d-10, chrysene d-12, benzo-a-pyrene d-12, perylene d-12, n-dodecane d-26, n-hexadecane d-34, n-eicosane d-42, n-tetracosane d-50, and n-triacontane d-62. One ml of surrogate standard solution was added to the samples, hydrocarbons were extracted in dichloromethane, and the extracts were dried with sodium sulphate before being solventexchanged to hexane. The hexane extracts were sent to Dr. Tom King at the Centre for Offshore Oil and Gas Environmental Research (Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Dartmouth, NS), for analysis by GC/MS (method in Garcia-Blanco et al. 2001). A similar extract of CEWAF stock solution, as well as extracts from water and dispersant controls were included in the analysis. 2.8 Statistics Non-linear regression analyses, Dunnett's tests, Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison tests, Pearson Correlation tests, extra sum-of-squares F tests, LC50 and EC50 calculations, and associated descriptive statistics for fertilization success, % mortality, BSD severity index, and % normal data were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.02, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Based on average water control and positive control/maximal response values, top and bottom regression constraints were 100 % and 0 % for % mortality, 85 % and 0 % for % normal, and 1 and 0.2 for BSD severity index. TableCurve 3D (version 4.0, Systat Software Inc.) was used to conduct multiple non-linear curve fitting analyses. Three dimensional surface plots were generated using TableCurve 3D, and formatted in SigmaPlot (version 11.0, Systat Software Inc.). Upper and lower 95 % confidence intervals for data analyzed by ANOVA were calculated as follows from the pooled mean error variance where t is the critical Student t value (two-tailed), N-1 refers to error degrees of freedom from the ANOVA, EMS is the error mean square from the ANOVA, and n is the number of replicates.\n\nChapter 3\n\nExposing gametes to 0.32 % CEWAF for 1 h significantly reduced fertilization success (Dunnett's Test, negative control = 95 %, p < 0.01; Figure 3). The 1 h EC50 for fertilization success was 0.19 % (top down to bottom variable slope regression, r 2 = 0.99). of MESA crude oil for 1 h. Error bars are 95% confidence limits (n = 3) and the dotted bar represents the 95% confidence interval of the average water control fertilization success.\n\nThe embryo sensitivity range finder test demonstrated that % mortality was negatively correlated with age at initial exposure (Pearson Correlation Test, p < 0.05).\n\nOn days 0 -2 of embryonic life, sensitivity to 1 % CEWAF (48 h exposure duration)\n\nsignificantly exceeded that of most other days (Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test, p < 0.05; Figure 4). of MESA crude oil for 48 h periods starting on different days post fertilization (dpf). To prevent overlap, 0.32 % v/v data were shifted slightly to the right along the x-axis. Error shown as a response surface in Figure 6.\n\nThe toxicity of CEWAF to embryos on 0 dpf was analyzed with sigmoidal doseresponse regressions (Figure 7). As expected, EC50s increased as the duration of exposure decreased for both % normal (exponential decay regression; Figure 7C) and BSD severity index (exponential decay regression; Figure 7F). The regressions describing BSD severity index in response to 3 and 48 h exposures did not fit the data accurately (r 2 = 0.27 and 0.28, respectively) and were not used to generate EC50 values.\n\nThe EC50s and ET50s for % normal and BSD severity index can be calculated using the equations described in Figures 8 and 9. Once again, multiple non-linear curve-fitting was used to provide a means of predicting the BSD severity index or % normal responses elicited by any plausible exposure starting 0 dpf. Exponential curve fitting was used to express the average % normal response (Figure 8). Non-linear dose-response curve fitting best expressed average BSD severity (Figure 9). h periods starting on different days post fertilization (dpf). Sigmoidal dose-response regressions were used to generate EC50s (for exposures 0-5 dpf, r 2 = 0.80, 0.92, 0.96, 0.84, 0.96, 0.90, respectively). An EC50 could not be calculated for exposures starting 11 dpf. Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals. where z = BSD severity index, x = time of initial exposure (dpf), y = CEWAF concentration (% v/v), a = -0.77, b = 1.2, c = 12, d = -0.96, e = 0.18, f = 0.25, g = 1.5, h = 0.57 (R 2 = 0.87). embryos exposed to CEWAF of MESA crude oil for various durations. A and D show average % normal and BSD severity index responses (n = 3) for different exposure scenarios. 95 % confidence intervals for the % normal means in A ranged 34 % (i.e. mean ± 17). The effect of duration on BSD severity index was not significant (One-way ANOVA, df = 20, p > 0.05). This precluded the calculation of 95 % confidence intervals for BSD severity index data. Top to bottom and sigmoidal regressions (B; E) for % normal and BSD severity index responses (A; D) generated the EC50s (C; F). As expected, the EC50s were highest when durations were lowest. Exponential decay regressions for each response type traced this relationship between EC50s and exposure duration. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and the shaded horizontal bars (B; E) represent the average responses of water controls ± standard error (n = 3). Percent normal ET50s can be calculated according to and BSD severity index ET50s can be calculated by where in both equations y = CEWAF concentration (% v/v). 59 A B C D E  and residual lines show the distance of data points from the surface. The logistic doseresponse model follows where z = BSD severity index, x = duration of exposure (h), y = CEWAF concentration (% v/v), a = 0.22, b = 0.13, c = 12, d = 2.5, e = 0.31, f = 0.053, g = 1.4, and h = 0.29.\n\nWithout displaying signs of BSD, hatched embryos died (apparently due to narcosis) in an exposure-dependent fashion after exposure to CEWAF (Figure 10).\n\nCEWAF concentration, exposure duration, and interactions between the two contributed to mortality (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.01), with CEWAF concentration contributing roughly 4x as much as duration. LC50 and LT50s can be calculated for various durations and concentrations the using equations in Figure 10. A three-dimensional curve was fit was to the data for prediction of toxicity (Figure 11). embryos exposed to CEWAF of MESA crude oil for various durations. Means in A had 95 % confidence intervals of 15 % (i.e. mean % mortality ± 7.5). Water control mortality was 0 % up to 144 h post hatch. Background mortality (30 %) first occurred on 168 h post hatch (i.e. the effects of starvation were not observed until 168 h post hatch). Sigmoidal dose-response regressions (B) show the positive correlation between CEWAF concentration and % mortality, as well as the increase in % mortality as duration increases (A). The tradeoff between concentration and duration is conveyed in C (exponential decay regression). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. LT50s for CEWAF concentrations can be calculated by\n\nUnsubstituted PAH, methylated PAH, and total hydrocarbon concentrations in 1 % and 0.1 % v/v CEWAF solutions, 0 and 24 h after their preparation, was measured by GC/MS (Table 4). These measurements were used to estimate actual PAH and hydrocarbon concentrations corresponding to nominal CEWAF concentrations (Table 5;\n\nFigure 12). This estimation assumed that the chemical composition of CEWAF changes proportionally with changes in concentration. Fluorescence spectrometry indicated that total hydrocarbon content of Petri dishes and Mason jars were not significantly different (Appendix A, Figure A8).  That is, herring exposed to CEWAF responded in an exposure-dependent fashion, and stage-specific differences were also observed. Gametes showed dramatic responses after exposures far more brief than those needed to elicit responses in other life stages.\n\nSensitivity fluctuated vastly during embryonic life, with some exposure levels completely wiping out 1 d old embryos, but having no visible effect on 11 d old embryos (Table 6).\n\nFree-swimming embryos did not display signs of sub-lethal toxicity (unlike pre-hatch embryos), but succumbed to what presented as narcosis after brief exposures to CEWAF (> 0.1 %). The toxicity of CEWAF was more a function of exposure concentration than duration for both embryos free-swimming embryos (Table 7). These variables also interacted with life stage effects to make one stage the most sensitive for one exposure regime, but the least sensitive for a different regime. Remarkably, each of the three stages could therefore be considered the most sensitive for different exposure conditions (Table 7). CYP1A activity was measured through EROD bioassays (data not shown) using a method adapted from Bowden (2005). The results suggested that the assay's limit of detection was reached, even when CYP1A was extracted from 75 positive control whole-individual homogenates. The high biomass demand may explain the lack of published data on CYP1A activity in early life stages of herring after exposure to CEWAF.\n\nThe fluctuation in sensitivity throughout embryonic life identified by the present work is corroborated by studies over the past twenty years that used various chemicals and test species (Hamm and Hinton 2000;Segnera et al. 2003;Sharp and Neff 1982;Hutchinson et al. 1998;Villalobos et al. 2000). Despite this reinforced likelihood of there being a brief period of sensitivity immediately after fertilization for many species, tests of the toxicity of a particular chemical to fish embryos often omit the first 12 -24 h of life in the experimental design. In many of these studies, embryos are exposed one to several dpf until hatch, and the results are presented as -embryo toxicity‖ (DeGraeve et al. 1980;Wilson and Tillitt 1996;Strmac and Braunbeck 1999;Wright and Tillitt 1999;Stasiunaite 2005). The problem with this situation is that other research groups could retest the toxicity of the same chemicals by exposing the same species of embryos for the same durations, yet get entirely different results if the exposures started 0 dpf. Namely, the former studies starting one to several dpf may underestimate the toxicity.\n\nMany publications appear to run this risk. In one case the initial age at exposure was reported as an estimate of anywhere from 24 to 50 h after fertilization (Walker et al. 1992). This design may have exposed some groups during the tail end of a critically sensitive period, while others were exposed thereafter. Some have even set out to test the acute toxicity of substances to embryos by exposing them several days after fertilization for brief durations (ex. Strmac and Braunbeck 1999;Eimon et al. 2008). These works may have tested toxicity during a robust stage of embryonic development, and may have thereby misrepresented toxicity during a more sensitive phase.\n\nResearchers must be cognizant of potential periods of sensitivity to avoid contradictions and confusion in the literature. In studies that test the acute toxicity of chemicals to fish embryos, it is especially important to inform decision-makers interpreting the results of any periods of sensitivity that were not tested, and implications of those omissions (see section 1.4.2).\n\nReported waterborne hydrocarbon concentrations resulting from dispersed spills generally agree that concentrations quickly diminish after dispersion, and that waterborne hydrocarbons are most concentrated near the surface. However, specific details of these reports are often cryptic or incomplete (ex. NRC 2005). The persistence of hydrocarbons in the water column is usually unclear, partially because many authors combine duration with concentration, as concentration x duration (i.e. ppm•h). An exposure of 1200 ppm•h, for instance, could be 1 h at 1200 ppm, or 24 h at 50 ppm. Additionally, very few reports include waterborne PAH concentrations resulting from oil dispersion. Nichols and Parker (1985) summarized 54 field experiments on the efficacy of dispersants. They reported that dispersed spills generate waterborne hydrocarbon concentrations of 1 -67 ppm, with 10 ppm being the most typical. Durations at those concentrations, as well as the depths at which they occurred were variable. McAuliffe (1989) predicted the most likely hydrocarbon concentrations under a dispersed spill (depth of 7 m) to be much higher: between 50 and 150 ppm. Assuming these concentrations persisted 1 -3 h, gametes and free-swimming embryos of herring would be at risk (Table 7). However, Lessard and DeMarco (2000) assured that the upper 10 m of the water column would contain 40 -60 ppm for only 1 h, suggesting only gametes would be affected (Table 7). Similarly, MacNeill et al. (1985) found 60 ppm hydrocarbon under a spill dispersed in an experimental wave basin. They, however, speculated that the duration would depend on case-specific conditions (wave energy, temperature, oil type, etc.). Moreover, Humphrey et al. (1987) recorded concentrations greater than 50 ppm for at least 16 h at a depth of 10 m (Baffin Island Oil Spill Project).\n\nAn undispersed control spill generated only 1 ppm hydrocarbon in the water column.\n\nWith peak dispersed oil concentrations of 150 ppm persisting about 1.5 h at 10 m of depth, the group described dispersion as a massive injection of oil into the water column.\n\nThis exposure would be detrimental to herring gametes, embryos (0 dpf), and freeswimming embryos (Table 7).\n\nIt is difficult to verify if these reported waterborne hydrocarbon concentrations relate to large-volume spills, or if they are based on average spill volumes. Gilfillan et al. (1985) found the hydrocarbon concentration to be 160 ppm 0.5 m under 1 m 3 of dispersed oil. Ballou et al. (1989) suggest that dispersing a spill of 100 -1000 barrels (14 -140 tons) would sustain a 50 ppm hydrocarbon concentration 1 -3 m deep for 24 h. This exposure exceeds the EC/LC50s for embryos and free-swimming embryos of herring, yet the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd. does not consider spills -major‖ unless > 700 tons are spilled (Table 1). One may deduce that a major spill would lead to an exposure 7x greater than 50 ppm for 24 h-either 350 ppm for 24 h, 50 ppm for 7 days, or somewhere in between. Alternatively, major spills may spread on the surface sufficiently to limit subsurface concentrations, but if this happened, the subsurface area of contamination would increase. Whichever the case, dispersion of a major spill would probably be highly detrimental for nearby early life stages of fish such as Atlantic herring.\n\nExposure of early life stages of fish depends on the depths of their spawning habitats. Along George's Bank, spawning occurs 40 -80 m deep, likely below the range of dispersed oil, especially on the southern flank of the bank where the water is physically stratified during herring spawning seasons (Butman and Beardsley 1987).\n\nLikewise, spring-spawning Norwegian herring spawn 250 m below the surface (Kurita et al. 2003). However, off the East Coast of Canada herring spawn 15 -60 m below the surface (Haegele and Schweigert 1985), which may be within the range of dispersed oil pollution. Pacific herring off British Columbia and along the Western United States preferentially spawn in very shallow water-anywhere from 0.5 -8 m below mean tidal depths (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). Similarly, Baltic herring spawn at 0 -4 m (Aneer et al. 1983). Finally, North Sea herring populations typically spawn either 10 -20 m or 2 -10 m deep (Johnston et al. 2005). As described in this section, dispersed oil can reach toxic concentrations relevant to many of these spawning depths.\n\nStudies on the toxicity of dispersed oil often compare WAF and CEWAF to demonstrate the higher toxicity of CEWAF (Table 3). As a function of hydrocarbon concentration, CEWAF has consistently been more toxic than WAF, so trials using WAF\n\nwere not repeated as part of this project. The visible difference in colour of CEWAF (yellow) and WAF (clear) was sufficient testimony that a higher concentration of hydrocarbons was located in CEWAF. The main concern was to measure actual hydrocarbon concentrations (ppm) corresponding to nominal (% v/v) concentrations of CEWAF. Whether studying WAF or CEWAF, waterborne hydrocarbon concentration appears to be the main determinant of toxicity (Table 3). Moreover, focusing attention on actual concentrations unifies the units used for both efficacy and toxicity research for dispersed oil. As this section demonstrates, having a common measure of waterborne hydrocarbon content increases the scope and practical utility of the overall research.\n\nFuture studies should continue in this direction.\n\nThe oil used in the present experiment was weathered once at Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, NS, and vortexed for 24 h prior to the bioassays (according to Singer et al. 2000). Since the weathering process voids oil of many narcotic constituents (French-McCay 2001), one can assume that acute lethality would have been higher if weathering did not take place. In fact, the SIMAP model estimates oil weathered for 10 h to be three times less toxic than its non-weathered counterpart (French-McCay 2001). As a result, dispersion models may draw attention away from the toxicity of weathered oil compared to non-weathered oil. The difference in putative toxicity inadvertently introduces the idea that spills for which the dispersion response is delayed several hours are not lethal to marine life, because the oil has sufficient time to weather. However, field observations with weathered Alaskan North Slope Oil (Carls et al. 1999), as well as the results herein are reminders that low doses of CEWAF of weathered oil can also be toxic. Moreover, given the sensitivity of early life stages of herring to CEWAF of weathered MESA, it follows that they could be much more sensitive to the non-weathered version.\n\nThe clarity of the results in Figure 3, and the few materials needed to produce the data make gametes convenient for toxicity testing. However, pre-fertilization remains a relatively unexplored stage. Its lack of popularity for toxicity testing may be due to its short duration in nature, and resultant low probability of being exposed to contaminants compared to other stages. Nevertheless, substrata in Prince William Sound spawning shoals are still contaminated with Valdez oil, even though water in the area is clean (Short et al. 2008). This situation suggests that in some cases, fish may be unaffected by contamination in their spawning areas, but unfertilized eggs and embryos that attach to substrata may be exposed.\n\nThe observed inhibition of gamete fertilization contradicted the only relevant published work on gametes (Carls et al. 1999). Finding that unfertilized Pacific herring eggs exposed via a parental pathway had no effect on fertilization, Carls et al. (1999) concluded that the risk of oil pollution to gametes is low, and that embryos are much more sensitive than gametes. This was not the case for Atlantic herring gametes exposed to dispersed oil. For short (1 h) durations of exposure, gametes were more sensitive than embryos (Table 7).\n\nThe gamete exposure lasted only 1 h; no other durations were tested due to a lack of information regarding the duration of time that expressed eggs normally spend before being fertilized. Perhaps eggs remain unfertilized one day before encountering sperm, perhaps only one minute. The best in-situ observation of herring's dimorphic spawning behavior was reported by Ewart (1884). He observed females stop above a vegetative seafloor and release ribbons of eggs that adhered to substrata as they descended to the bottom. Several males subsequently encircled the location, and from some 25 cm above, released short ribbons of milt that slowly settled toward the eggs. This observation means there is at least some lag time between the expression of eggs and milt. He also suggested that females spawn over 3 d, while the males take about twice that long. Does this mean that some eggs remain unfertilized for days? Or perhaps the males stick around to fertilize the eggs twice over. Not knowing the answer, one hour was chosen as a middle ground (section 2.5.1), and is not necessarily realistic. If the natural lag time turned out to be shorter than 1 h, it is conceivable that fertilization success would be greater than what is presented in Figure 3. If the lag time were greater, more exposure (and more toxic effect) would likely take place before fertilization has a change to occur.\n\nMore research needs to be done to assess these inferences. If in doing so the results were similar to those in Figure 3, despite manipulating the exposure duration, one would have to consider the possibility that CEWAF is physically toxic to gametes. That is, CEWAF concentrations ≥ 0.32 % may inhibit the motility of sperm and/or block their access to the micropylar region of eggs, regardless of exposure duration. Teleost sperm travel preferentially along a groove in the micropylar region, guided by chemoattractants. Without the guidance of the microplye, the chances of fertilization success may be reduced by up to 99 % (Amanze and Ayengar 1990). The observed reduction in fertilization could therefore be due to adulteration of micropylar regions by components of CEWAF. Another possibility is that a slight increase in the surface tension of water around and/or in the micropyle caused by the presence of CEWAF impedes the general motility of sperm.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that CEWAF physically inhibits the motility of sperm, one could repeat the procedure described in section 2.5.1 with the following modification.\n\nAfter 1 h of exposing eggs to milt/CEWAF, one could dilute the milt/CEWAF mixture to effectively reduce the concentration of CEWAF below the theoretical EC10 level, and allow fertilization to occur for another hour. If fertilization success was similar to that of control conditions during the second hour, then such reversibility in effect would suggest that CEWAF primarily caused physical toxicity rather than chemical toxicity to the gametes.\n\nIt is also possible that short exposure to CEWAF immediately after fertilization appeared as a reduction in fertilization success. It may be possible to test for this by fertilizing groups of eggs for a short duration (1 or 2 min), and exposing them to CEWAF immediately thereafter for 1 h. If the viability of the exposed groups followed a curve similar to that in Figure 3, then the toxicity illustrated in Figure 3 might have been a\n\nresult of toxicity to embryos.\n\nOne of the most remarkable findings of this study was that the sensitivity of embryos to dispersed oil tapered off as they aged, with once-sensitive embryos becoming 100-fold more resistant to CEWAF in a matter of days. Uncovering this type of fluctuation in sensitivity is paramount to future research on early life stages of other common test species. This study does not provide evidence for sensitive periods in other fish species, but vertebrate ontogeny is quite phylogenetically conserved, and the potential mechanisms of these sensitivities apply to various species (section 1.4.1).\n\nMoreover, the observed decrease in sensitivity throughout embryonic life is corroborated by other early life studies that tested various chemicals and species (Hamm and Hinton 2000;Segnera et al. 2003;Sharp and Neff 1982;Hutchinson et al. 1998;Villalobos et al. 2000).\n\nHigh sensitivity immediately after fertilization supports the idea that water hardening of the chorion imparts resistance to waterborne xenobiotics (Blaxter 1988).\n\nThe process likely eliminates the micropyle as a route of exposure. Dechorionated embryos may simulate embryos that have chorions yet to undergo water hardening. Villalobos et al. (2000) reported that dechorionation significantly increased mortality of medaka exposed to Thiobencarb. Nevertheless, dechorionated embryos did not display more sublethal abnormalities (scoliosis, erosion of fin tissues, edemas) than chroionated embryos, suggesting the chorion only prevented narcosis. The change in sensitivity between embryos and free-swimming embryos of herring supports this idea. Eleven dpf embryos were very resistant to CEWAF, but freshly hatched free-swimming embryos (12 dpf) were sensitive to it, and did not display signs of BSD before dying. Additional factors that are unrelated to the chorion may also contribute to the mechanisms of stagespecific differences in sensitivity to CEWAF (not tested; reviewed in section 1.4.1).\n\nPercent mortality is probably the most ecologically and commercially relevant toxicological response to describe when attempting to make clear-cut risk assessments.\n\nHowever, BSD severity index and % normal ratings were used to provide a more detailed picture of the effects of low exposures to CEWAF. Percent mortality assessments could suggest that because no individuals died due to a certain exposure, the risk of that exposure is nil. It overlooks sublethal effects that could impair chances of survival and reproduction. Hence, other than in the rangefinder experiment, % normal and BSD severity index were used to describe the prevalence and severity of abnormalities, as well as the mortality rate. BSD severity index described the average severity of BSD and rate of mortality, and % normal described the prevalence of BSD within the exposed group.\n\nPercent normal was not used to account for mortality. This enabled the results to uncover links between lethal and sublethal effects. For example, a combination of high BSD severity index score and low % normal score suggests mortality and morphological effects are linked. In contrast, if BSD severity index and % normal were both high, then one could argue that mortality is due to narcosis, or some mechanism unrelated to sublethal signs of BSD.\n\nBSD severity index can be misleading on its own. Consider the following comparison. A group of 25 exposed individuals, all with bent spines (score of 2 for all)\n\ncould have a score identical to that of a much different group of 25. Five of the latter may have bent spines (score of 2) and pericardial edemas (score of 3), 2 may be dead, and 18 may appear normal. In the former circumstance, the survivorship of all individuals would likely be challenged, while in the latter, only one quarter of the individuals would likely be lethally affected. BSD severity index would not differentiate between the two scenarios; both groups would have a BSD severity index score of about 50. However, % normal would be different for each group. The first would have 0 % normal, and the second would have 75 % normal. Thus, combining % normal with BSD severity index also provides an indication of the variability of responses. For the 25 individuals with bent spines, the variation of the response to CEWAF would be low, since many individuals responded similarly. In the second example, the responses were more variable (ranging from normal to dead), suggesting the molecular targets of CEWAF varied dramatically from one individual to the next. If BSD was the only response reported in these examples, it would be difficult to gauge the variability.\n\nOther researchers use a similar approach to rating lethal and sublethal effects. Scott and Hodson (2008) combined BSD (strictly sublethal effects) and BSD severity index (lethal and sublethal) ratings. Percent normal may be superior to BSD in some cases because its upper and lower maxima are easier to identify and statistically constrain (Scott, J., personal communication. Queen's University, Kingston ON, January, 2009). A major con with assessing sublethal responses like BSD is that it is difficult to know if it is reversible (i.e. if individuals can recover from it). In a similar vein, even if no signs of toxicity were observed, latent effects (cancer, reproductive failure) may develop (Buschmann 2006). More work needs to be done to elucidate the fates of individuals that survived exposure to CEWAF. Several attempts to test the fates of survivors were impeded by difficulties in feeding and raising larvae. Nevertheless, even if BSD signs were reversible in the lab, recovery may not occur in nature. Impaired motility and delayed growth are typically associated with even mild BSD (Sweezey 2005; Ramachandran 2005; personal observation). Individuals with BSD in nature would therefore have an impaired ability to locate and consume prey, and to evade predators. Additionally, sublethal exposures may immunosuppress individuals. Sublethal exposure to hydrocarbons has been shown to severely immunosuppress adult Pacific herring, making individuals susceptible to opportunistic pathogens such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia (Carls et al. 1998).\n\nThe confidence intervals of nearly all EC50s in Figure 5 overlap. Had the range of exposure concentrations been larger, these intervals would be smaller and overlap less.\n\nSigmoidal dose-response regressions can be constrained by empirical maxima and minima, which if not reached by the data series, generate EC50s with large confidence intervals. For example, responses on 0 dpf ranged from approximately 0.6 -1 for BSD severity index (Figure 5), but the minimum response was constrained at 0 and the maximum at 1. Extending the concentration series with smaller concentrations to generate the minimum response would have enabled the EC50 to be calculated with more certainty. Similarly, exposures starting 5 dpf produced responses that approached the minimum constraint, but that only reached slightly more than half way to the maximum response. Higher exposure concentrations would have been needed to generate the maximum response and to reduce the 95% confidence interval of the EC50.\n\nExtending the exposure concentration range in these ways would have vastly increased the amount of work needed to carry out the experiment, so a decision was made against it. Moreover, it was clear that significant differences existed among the groups tested, and that young embryos were most sensitive.\n\nBSD responses of embryos in Figure 5 range from 0 (negative control) to 1, while those in Figure 7 range from approximately 0.2 (negative control) to 1. This anomaly can be explained in two ways. Firstly, the individuals described in Figure 5 were produced by fall-spawning adults of Escuminac, NB, while those in Figure 7 were from springspawning adults of Eastern Passage, NS. No differences were noted in the appearance of fish carcasses or the gametes inside, but obtaining samples of spawning adults and combining their gametes was much more successful in the fall. This observation corroborated reports that the fecundity of spring spawners is lower than that of fall spawners (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). It was assumed that once fertilized, embryos were of equal quality, and that fertilization success did not correlate to sensitivity to CEWAF. This assumption was validated in finding lower EC50s for fall-spawned embryos (Figure 5) than for spring-spawned embryos (Figure 7).\n\nThe more likely explanation for the variation is that the embryos described in Figure 5 and 7 were scored for BSD by different individuals. Some signs of BSD may have therefore been rated differently between the two experiments.\n\nSigmoidal dose-response regressions of raw average responses by day 0 embryos were shown once again to demonstrate the degree to which CEWAF exposure series elicited all possible responses (Figure 7A). Many of the regressions generated EC50 estimates with reasonable confidence, but it is clear that increasing the range of exposure concentrations would have increased the confidence of the EC50s, particularly for BSD severity index data. Many regressions for BSD severity index responses appeared to be only small sections of sigmoidal curves, explaining the large confidence intervals surrounding the EC50s generated by these curves (Figure 7E).\n\nBSD severity index and % normal data differed in many cases, usually with BSD severity index indicating higher toxicity than indicated by % normal. For example, with 12 h exposures at 0.1 % CEWAF, approximately 80 % of embryos appeared normal-a difference of 10 % from the negative control. In contrast, BSD severity index differed almost 50 % from the negative control for the same exposure level. This means that the individuals affected by BSD were severely affected (or dead), and those that were not as affected appeared completely normal-a good sign since it denotes genetic variability within the population. If, in a similar study, % normal deviated from the negative control level as much as BSD severity index deviated, the genetic variability of the test group would probably be lower.\n\nAnother interesting finding of the 0 dpf exposure is that duration affected % normal much more than BSD severity index (Figure 7C, F). As a function of duration, the % normal EC50 curve spanned three orders of magnitude for CEWAF concentration, from 3 to 0.003 % (v/v), tapering off somewhere around 100 h. Meanwhile, the range of the BSD severity index EC50s was significantly smaller: two orders of magnitude from 6 to 0.06 % (v/v). Biologically, this difference meant that some individuals were severely afflicted with BSD, not so much due to exposure duration, but as a result of concentration and possibly a predisposed susceptibility to the exposure. Increasing the duration of exposure did not increase the severity of BSD in highly affected individuals, but it caused resistant individuals to eventually show mild signs of BSD, and thereby reduce the % normal score. In other words, duration made little difference to sensitive individuals-they were affected after a short while. However, it made a difference to resistant individuals, which seemed to have a limited supply of defense mechanisms against the exposure.\n\nNo sublethal responses were observed for free-swimmers exposed to CEWAF, so % mortality was the most sensitive indicator of toxicity that did not require immunohistochemistry or enzyme assays. Duration of exposure had less effect on freeswimmers than it did on 0-day-old embryos. A non-linear regression of the EC50s in as the duration of exposure exceeded 8 h, but not to the same extent as the EC50 regressions for 0 dpf embryos. Similarly the 3D surface in Figure 11 indicated that exposure concentration chiefly affects the toxicity of CEWAF to free-swimming embryo. French-McCay (2001) reports that SIMAP and OilToxEx models are based on a second order relationship between mortality and duration of exposure, and a first order relationship between mortality and hydrocarbon concentration. The inner workings of the models are difficult to understand, but if they indeed base responses on the square of exposure durations, the present results question the validity of that condition.\n\nThe largest drop in EC50 occurred between 72 and 96 h. This brings up the possibility that starvation had a role in the observed toxicity. Although no negative controls died throughout the 144 h experiment, their yolk sacs were almost exhausted and swim-up was imminent. As the experiment proceeded, they may have been catabolizing every readily available source of energy, sources which in exposed individuals could have been contaminated with PAHs.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the experiment was repeated, and individuals were fed brine shrimp daily, beginning 96 h post-hatch. Unfortunately, no individuals would feed, even after the swim-up stage. The food source was likely inappropriate, though it was recommended in literature about culturing herring (Dinnel 2005).\n\nAlthough the LC50 regression suggests that LC50s continue to drop as duration increases beyond 144 h (Figure 10C), the raw LC50 data points suggest otherwise, as they appear to level off around 100 h. It is debatable which case is more likely. The literature suggests that larvae are more sensitive than embryos (reviewed by Hutchinson et al. 1998), but unfortunately, little distinction between free-swimming embryos and larvae was made in these studies. The defining difference between free-swimming embryos and larvae is that larvae feed exogenously. Feeding could provide the energy needed to detoxify hydrocarbons, or even to avoid catabolizing contaminated tissues. On the other hand, if prey items of the larvae were also contaminated by CEWAF, then exogenous feeding could compound the risk to herring. Dispersion models (French-McCay 2002) and field studies (section 4.2) indicate that realistic exposure durations following spills do not exceed those tested herein, so the question of greater duration is inconsequential. Moreover it is particularly clear from Figure 11 that concentration has, by far, the greatest relevance to CEWAF toxicity to free-swimming embryos.\n\nEstimates of toxicity by the curve-fitting model in Figure 11 are generally less than estimates by sigmoidal regressions in Figure 10B. The 3D regression (Figure 11) suggests that CEWAF concentrations less than 0.32 % caused little effect up to 48 h of exposure, and mortality of 30 % or less for longer durations at the same concentration.\n\nMeanwhile, the sigmoidal regressions (Figure 11B) suggest that 0.32 % is close to the EC50 for durations less than 10 h, and well above the EC50 for greater exposure durations. It would thus be imprudent to estimate toxicity of CEWAF of free-swimmers based solely on Figure 11.\n\nData in this thesis should be considered by oil spill responders and modelers.\n\nLethal and sublethal responses of gametes, embryos, and free-swimming embryos to dispersed oil must be estimated to calculate the cost to fisheries (Appendix B) and net environmental effects of dispersion. These responses are outputs of the statistical models presented in this work.\n\nThe sensitivity of Atlantic herring embryos to waterborne hydrocarbons from MESA is similar to that of mummichog embryos, 10 times less than that of rainbow trout embryos, and 100 times less than Japanese medaka embryos (Table 3). Thus any inclination that concern is necessary only during herring spawning seasons is unwarranted. All available evidence compellingly indicates that early life stages of other species spawning at different times are also at risk from dispersed spills.\n\nCommercial effects-forecasting models for dispersed oil estimate toxicity using chronic toxicity data, largely under the assumption that sensitivity is uniform throughout development. Moreover, the available body of chronic toxicity data for fish embryos poorly characterizes toxicity during the most sensitive phase of embryonic development (sections 4.1.1 and 1.4.2). As a result, the toxicity of dispersed oil to fish embryos may be underestimated. Modelers should therefore use empirical data in this thesis to update software models that utilize outdated data and/or invalid assumptions. This collaboration between toxicologists, modelers, and spill responders will help to achieve the common goal of managing spilled oil in the most cost-effective and environmentally appropriate manner.\n\nThe regressions and models presented herein should be tested and validated using an oil spill simulator, such as the 32 m long wave tank at Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, NS. This unit allows users to measure the movement of dispersed oil plumes within the water column, with adjustable surface wave and circulation conditions. It could be adapted to expose herring eggs suspended in a cage (Kocan et al. 1996) to a moving plume of dispersed oil. After exposure, eggs could be transferred to clean water, and assessed for signs of toxicity. The degree of correspondence between the observed toxicity and the toxicity predicted by the models would assess the ability of static renewal experimentation to recreate dynamic oil spill conditions. The relative importance of artificial versus authentic salt water, localized oxygen depletion, and accumulation of toxic metabolites assumed in the lab could also be assessed using the wave tank. Finally, investigating the effect of water temperature on toxicity will be particularly useful in the identification of differences in risk during fall and spring spawning seasons, and at different spawning depths.\n\n The toxicity of dispersed oil to free-swimming embryos depended more on the exposure concentration than on the duration of exposure.\n\n Embryos (0 dpf) were more sensitive to long exposures (24 h); freeswimming embryos and gametes were more sensitive to short exposures\n\n(1 -10 h). CEWAF. Adding dispersant to oil-water mixtures increases the THC of the resulting CEWAF, but an exception to this trend appears to exist when comparing CEWAFs with dispersant contents of 500ul and 1000ul.

This relationship is expressed mathematically in the following proportionality:\n\nwhere E represents the number of embryos thought to be exposed, K1 is the survival probability of average, non-oiled embryos, and X is the BSD severity index score for the given concentration and duration of exposure. E is divided by 6 because approximately 2 d out of the 12 d of embryonic life are sensitive to oil, while the other 10 d were found to be much more resistant. F represents the number of free-swimming embryos thought to be exposed, K2 would be the survivorship probability of an average free-swimming embryo, and Y is the % mortality for the given exposure. L represents the number of larvae thought to be affected, K3 would be their estimated normal survivorship, and Z represents the % mortality for the given exposure.\n\nThis proportionality is obviously a theoretical estimate of a risk that in practice would depend on more variables. It also assumes the presence of all ages of embryos at the time of oiling, treating those aged 0 -1 d as having maximum sensitivity, and those 2 -12 d old as having no sensitivity. The sensitivity of free-swimming embryos determined herein is also assumed to be constant from hatch to swim-up. One must also consider that, depending on the duration of exposure, some individuals may spend part of that time as embryos and some as free-swimmers. The mortality of larvae caused by CEWAF was not studied, but the mass of data collected by the ECETOC Aquatic\n\nEstimating the risk of a dispersed oil spill to early life stages of fish is thus complex and dynamic. This section outlined the basic information needed to estimate risk to demonstrate how the data presented in this thesis clarify some of the most important variables in risk calculation (i.e. X, Y, and Z in the risk proportionality).\n\nThree-dimensional curve-fitting was used to achieve the more practical application of this work: enabling spill responders to predict the effects of various CEWAF exposures to early life stages of herring. For example, the equation corresponding to the surface in Figure 6 can be used to rapidly estimate the effects of a particular exposure concentration to embryos of various ages. The shape of the curve on the y-axis (CEAWF concentration) follows the classic dose-response -S‖ shape recognized in toxicology, and the steep slope along the x-axis (age at initial exposure)\n\nfollows the descending sensitivity from early to late embryonic life. A consistent feature with the 3D curves is that they are relatively smooth, and lack non-uniform contours.\n\nThis style of curve-fitting was intentional. TableCurve 3D can fit curves to data that have extremely high R 2 values, or in other words, very small amounts of deviation from the data supplied to the program. For example, outlying data can be incorporated into 3D surfaces, appearing as abrupt contours in the surface like mountains and valleys on a contour map. At that point, however, the program would be fitting non-uniform, theoretically unexplainable, and non-replicable variation in the data. An analogy would be a line of best fit that connects every data point, even if they deviate wildly from an expected linear correlation. Including this type of variation would defeat the purpose of the 3D regression analysis: to guide interpolation between data points; to use the data as a whole to describe the relationship between the variables; and to provide a means of predicting responses to exposures with consistent degrees of confidence, regardless of the exposure characteristics. In order to prevent the program from incorporating unexplained variance into regression surfaces, the mathematical functions that the program used to generate surfaces were limited to dose-response and exponential decay -transition functions‖.\n\nIt should be noted that the 3D regressions were not designed with extrapolation in mind. Since TableCurve 3D unfortunately does incorporate experimentally determined constraints, such as response maxima and minima, the program produces surfaces that sometimes go beyond upper and lower response limits. For example, the surface in well below the minimum response (0). These extremes add to the error rating of surfaces, but any user of the program can easily realize that estimated responses of -0.2 or 1.05 are impossible, and translate into 0 and 1, respectively. The R 2 values of graphs with such extremes are thus slightly under-estimated, because a user can easily correct (nullify) the error represented by the extremes. TableCurve 3D produced the surfaces by connecting a selection of points (at intersections of contour lines) that were generated by the regression equation. At sections on the surfaces where few contour line intersect (i.e. along 0.032% in Figure 8; along 3 h\n\nReferences: 1-Wu, D. personal communication.
