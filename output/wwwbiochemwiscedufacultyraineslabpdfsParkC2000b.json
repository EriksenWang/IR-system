    "abstract": "Dimeric proteins can arise by the swapping of structural domains between monomers. The prevalence of this occurrence is unknown. Ribonuclease A ~RNase A! is assumed to be a monomer near physiological conditions. Here, this hypothesis is tested and found to be imprecise. The two histidine residues ~His12 and His119! in the active site of RNase A arise from two domains ~S-peptide and S-protein! of the protein. The H12A and H119A variants have 10 5 -fold less ribonucleolytic activity than does the wild-type enzyme. Incubating a 1:1 mixture of the H12A and H119A variants at pH 6.5 and 65 8C results in a 10 3 -fold increase in ribonucleolytic activity. A large quantity of active dimer can be produced by lyophilizing a 1:1 mixture of the H12A and H119A variants from acetic acid. At pH 6.5 and 65 8C, the ribonucleolytic activity of this dimer converges to that of the dimer formed by simply incubating the monomers, as expected for a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the dimer is near 2 mM at both 65 and 37 8C. This value of K d is only 20-fold greater than the concentration of RNase A in the cow pancreas, suggesting that RNase A dimers exist in vivo. The intrinsic ability of RNase A to form dimers under physiological conditions is consistent with a detailed model for the evolution of homodimeric proteins. Dimers of \"monomeric\" proteins could be more prevalent than is usually appreciated.",
    "full_text": "The assembly of oligomeric proteins from monomers by domain swapping is a recurrent theme ~Bennett et al., 1995;Schlunegger et al., 1997!. Bovine seminal ribonuclease ~BS-RNase! is a quintessential example of a domain-swapped dimer ~D' Alessio et al., 1997;D'Alessio, 1999aD'Alessio, , 1999b!. Although ribonuclease A ~RNase A! and BS-RNase share a similar three-dimensional structure as well as more than 80% of their amino acid residues, only BS-RNase is known to form a domain-swapped dimer naturally ~Fig. 1A! ~Piccoli et al., 1992;Mazzarella et al., 1993!. BS-RNase can also form a domain-swapped tetramer ~Adinolfi et al., 1996!.\n\nRNase A can form domain-swapped dimers by an artificial procedure-lyophilization from a concentrated solution in 50% acetic acid ~Crestfield et al., 1962~Crestfield et al., , 1963!. !. This dimer has been shown to have two different conformers ~Gotte & Libonati, 1998; Sorrentino et al., 2000!. The structure of one of these conformers has been determined ~Liu et al., 1998! and is distinct from that of the BS-RNase dimer ~Fig. 1B!. Dimeric RNase A is thermally unstable, dissociating to monomers irreversibly upon incubation at high temperature ~Crestfield et al., 1962!. His12 and His119 are active-site residues near the N-and C-termini, respectively, of RNase A. The H12A and H119A variants have 10 5 -fold lower ribonucleolytic activity than does the wild-type enzyme ~Thompson & Raines, 1995!. Dimerization of these variants by domain swapping should result in composite active sites and the regain of ribonucleolytic activity ~Fig. 2!. Hence, an assay of enzymatic activity could be used to assess readily and quantitatively the extent of domain swapping. Here, we use this method to analyze the thermodynamics and kinetics of dimer formation by RNase A. Most significantly, we find that RNase A spontaneously forms domain-swapped dimers near neutral pH. This discovery of a pre-evolved ability for domain swapping in a monomeric protein enables us to propose a detailed model for the evolution of dimeric proteins.\n\nProtein complementation by enzyme variants has been recognized as a useful tool to study the structure of multimeric enzymes with composite active sites ~Larimer et al., 1987;Wente & Schachman, 1987;Tobias & Kahana, 1993;Li et al., 1997! or multiple domains ~van Gent et al., 1993;Kao et al., 1996;Witkowski et al., 1996!. Chemical modification of RNase A and BS-RNase had been used previously to show the existence of composite active sites by the formation of active dimers from inactive monomers ~Crestfield et al., 1963;Piccoli et al., 1992!. Because of the residual catalytic activity remaining after incomplete modification and purification, chemically modified enzymes do not allow for quantitation of domain swapping. Using H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A, along with sensitive assays for ribonucleolytic activity, allowed us to monitor accurately the dimerization of RNase A.\n\nSteady-state kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly~cytidylic acid! @poly~C!# by the H12A RNase A{H119A RNase A dimer formed by lyophilization from 50% acetic acid are listed in Table 1. Assays were performed at pH 7.0 instead at pH 6.0 ~which is more typical!, because the dimer was observed to lose its ribonucleolytic activity slowly at pH 6.0. For comparison, steady-state kinetic parameters for monomers of wild-type RNase A was also determined under the same conditions ~Table 1!. The values of k cat and k cat 0K M for the H12A RNase A{H119A RNase A dimer are ~39 6 4!% and ~31 6 2!% of those for the wild-type monomer, respectively. These values are close to 25%, the relative activity expected from a theoretical 50% yield of dimers with 50% of the activity of wild-type RNase A.\n\nThe dimer of H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A formed by lyophilization lost its catalytic activity rapidly when incubated at 65 8C ~Fig. 3A!. In only 2 min, the specific activity decreased from 58 s Ϫ1 to 0.29 s Ϫ1 , which is a 99.5% decrease. Surprisingly, the remaining activity increased slowly and converged to 0.82 s Ϫ1 , which is 10 3 -fold higher than that of monomers of H12A RNase A or H119A RNase A. This convergence indicates that the dimer does not convert to monomer completely upon incubation at 65 8C.\n\nThe conformational stability of the dimer was also determined at 37 8C. The dimer was stable at 37 8C ~Fig. 3B!. After a slight initial decrease, the activity remained constant for 90 min.\n\nTo probe for the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium near neutral pH, an equimolar mixture of H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A was prepared and incubated at pH 6.5 and 65 8C. The catalytic activity of the mixture increased rapidly ~Fig. 3A!. The specific activity reached 0.71 s Ϫ1 in 2 min and did not change until 90 min. The average of the last three specific activities was   ~0.76 6 0.06! s Ϫ1 . This value is within error of 0.82 s Ϫ1 , the activity remaining after the thermal inactivation of the dimer formed by lyophilization. This convergence to the same activity by heating the dimer to 65 8C or mixing the monomers at 65 8C indicates that a monomer-dimer equilibrium does indeed exist. By using SA obs ϭ ~0.76 6 0.06! s Ϫ1 as the observed specific activity at equilibrium, SA ref ϭ ~58 6 3! s Ϫ1 as the maximal specific activity ~vide supra!, and @M# total ϭ 12 mM as the total concentration of H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A, the concentration of dimer at equilibrium was estimated to be @D# ϭ ~0.079 6 0.007! mM by Equation 1.\n\nWith this concentration, the equilibrium dissociation constant was determined to be K d ϭ ~1.8 6 0.1! mM by Equation 2 ~Table 2!.\n\nTo determine the equilibrium dissociation constant at physiological temperature, a mixture of H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A was likewise incubated at 37 8C ~Fig. 3B!. The activity of this mixture also increased sharply and reached a specific activity of ~0.50 6 0.03! s Ϫ1 , which is similar to that of the mixture incubated at 65 8C. The concentration of dimer at equilibrium was calculated to be @D# ϭ ~0.052 6 0.004! mM by Equation 1. The equilibrium dissociation constant was determined to be K d ϭ ~2.7 6 0.2! mM by Equation 2~Table 2!. The activity of the mixture did not change significantly after 20 h of incubation ~data not shown!.\n\nThe dimer formed by lyophilization loses its catalytic activity rapidly at 65 8C ~Fig. In other words, the presence of Ala12 and Ala119 diminishes conformational stability. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the K d for a dimer of wild-type RNase A may actually be less than that for   3A and 3B.\n\nb The values of @Dimer# and K d were calculated by using Equations 1 and 2.\n\nthe H12A RNase A{H119A RNase A dimer. Nevertheless, dimerization of wild-type RNase A near neutral pH had never been observed previously, presumably because its K d value is too high to allow for its detection by conventional analytical methods ~e.g., gel filtration chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, calorimetry, and so forth!.\n\nThe dimer formed near neutral pH seems to be distinct from that formed by lyophilization from 50% acetic acid. The dissociation of the neutral-pH dimer at 37 8C is markedly fast compared with that of the dimer formed by lyophilization from acetic acid ~Fig. 3B!. The monomer-dimer equilibrium can be written as A ϩ B R r AB, with an association rate constant of k a and a dissociation rate constant of k d . The rate of dimer formation can be written as\n\nBecause the initial concentration of homodimers in each solution of monomer is negligible, @A# and @B# are approximately equal to @A# total and @B# total , respectively. By solving differential Equation 3, @AB# can be written as\n\nWhen the dimer formed by lyophilization dissociates, the initial contribution of k a @A#@B# in Equation 3 is negligible. At short times, @AB# can be written as\n\n. ~5! If the dimer formed at neutral pH has the same structure as the dimer formed by lyophilization, then the two dimers should have the same value of k d . Nonlinear regression analysis of the data in Figure 3B with Equation 4 ~association! and Equation 5 ~dissociation!, results in disparate values of k d . The dimer formed at neutral pH has k d ϭ ~0.15 6 0.03! s Ϫ1 , whereas the dimer formed by lyophilization has k d ϭ ~0.002 6 0.001! s Ϫ1 . Thus, the dimer formed at neutral pH is distinct from the dimer formed by lyophilization. This result is consistent with the observation of an initial dip in ribonucleolytic activity when the dimer formed by lyophilization from 50% acetic acid was incubated at 65 8C ~Fig. 3A!. The residual activity initially declines ~to 0.29 s Ϫ1 ! but slowly recovers ~to 0.82 s Ϫ1 !. Apparently, the dimer formed by lyophilization ~D! dissociates to monomers ~M! first, then forms a dimer with a different structure ~D*! as in Equation 6. D r 2M R r D*. ~6! The dimer formed by lyophilization has been reported to have two distinct conformers ~Gotte & Libonati, 1998; Sorrentino et al., 2000!. The above kinetic analysis shows that the dimer formed at neutral pH is distinct from that of both conformers formed by lyophilization ~Table 3!. The dimer formed by RNase A at neutral pH could have a conformation similar to that of the BS-RNase dimer ~Fig. 1A!. The monomers of BS-RNase are cross-linked by two intermolecular disulfide bonds ~D 'Alessio, 1995'Alessio, , 1999a'Alessio, , 1999b;;Di Donato et al., 1995!. With these disulfide bonds intact, the domain-swapped dimer ~M ϫ M! has a free energy equivalent to that of the covalently linked dimer without domain swapping ~M ϭ M! ~Piccoli et al., 1992; Kim et al., 1995!. The formation of a BS-RNase-like dimer by RNase A has a precedent. The K31C0S32C variant of RNase A forms two intermolecular disulfide bonds and swaps its S-peptide domain in the resulting dimer ~Di Donato et al., 1995;Ciglic et al., 1998!. Domain swapping has been shown to endow BS-RNase with distinct biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as allostery ~Piccoli et al., 1992! andcytotoxicity ~Cafaro et al., 1995;Kim et al., 1995!. Due to the structural similarity between BS-RNase and RNase A, engineering RNase A to form dimers like BS-RNase has also been used to endow new biological functions ~Di Donato et al., 1994;Cafaro et al., 1998! or to explore the molecular evolution of BS-RNase ~Di Donato et al., 1995;Ciglic et al., 1998!. RNase A as well as its human homolog have been engineered to form dimers, and the cytotoxicity of those variants approaches that of BS-RNase ~Cafaro et al., 1998;Piccoli et al., 1999!. Given that the engineered dimeric structure confers cytotoxicity to RNase A, the endogenous concentration of dimeric RNase A in vivo is of significant interest. The concentration of RNase A in bovine pancreas has been estimated to be 0.1 mM ~Barnard, 1969!. With the assumption that the K d of 2.7 mM determined here for dimer dissociation at 37 8C is still valid in vivo, the concentration of domain-swapped RNase A dimer in bovine pancreas is 3 mM. This value is comparable to the IC 50 value of BS-RNase for transformed cell lines ~Kim et al., 1995!. This finding could have important implications in understanding the biological role of RNase A.\n\nThe evolution of homodimeric proteins is a topic of much current interest in molecular evolution ~Bennett et al., 1995;Ciglic et al., 1998!. Because multiple mutations are necessary to provide a complimentary intermolecular interface, the mechanism for the evolution of a stable dimeric protein is enigmatic. Domain swapping has been proposed to explain how an intermolecular interface can evolve without changing multiple residues ~Bennett et al., 1995!. In the domain swapping model, a monomeric protein swaps one of its domains with another monomer to form a homodimer. Then, residues can be replaced to stabilize the nascent dimer.\n\nThe intermolecular interface in a domain-swapped homodimer has two components. A \"C-interface\" is the intermolecular interface that evolves from the closed intramolecular interface in each monomer. An \"O-interface\" is the new intermolecular interface, which was an open surface in each monomer. Hence, the evolution The dimerization of RNase A also has an interesting implication for the evolution of composite active sites. As mentioned above, protein complementation experiments have been used to identify proteins with composite active sites ~Larimer et al., 1987; Wente & Schachman, 1987;Tobias & Kahana, 1993;Li et al., 1997!. The fusion of single-domain proteins has been proposed as a mechanism for the evolution of composite active sites ~Bennett et al., 1995!. According to this proposal, an active site develops at a domain interface after a primitive monomer with two domains is formed by the fusion of genes encoding two single-domain proteins.\n\nWe propose an alternative mechanism for the evolution of homodimers with composite active sites. Our mechanism is shown in Figure 4. This mechanism is based on our detection of an RNase A dimer at neutral pH, the known ability of the S-protein and S-peptide fragments to form a stable noncovalent complex ~Richards, 1955; Richards & Vithayathil, 1959!, and physicochemical considerations. We begin with protein I ~Fig. 4!, which is a primitive protein that has no biological activity. An active site evolves by natural selection, to give protein II. The evolution of the active site is likely to destabilize the protein for the following reasons. First, active-site residues tend to be hydrophilic so as to provide the Brønsted acids, Brønsted bases, nucleophiles, hydrogen bonds, and Coulombic interactions needed for function ~Warshel, 1998!. The evolution of a hydrophilic active site creates a solvent-accessible concave surface, which is likely to be less favorable to conformational stability than a hydrophobic core. Second, active-site residues can have pK a values that differ by several units from their intrinsic pK a values ~for a dramatic example, see Highbarger et al., 1996!. Conformational stability must be sacrificed to perturb the pK a values of these residues. Finally, proteins often have clusters of cationic or anionic residues at their active sites @e.g., the cationic residues of RNase A ~Fisher et al., 1998a, 1998b!# to enhance Coulombic interactions with their ligand ~e.g., the anionic phosphoryl groups of RNA!. This clustering is unfavorable to conformational stability because of repulsive Coulombic forces ~Grimsley et al., 1999;Loladze et al., 1999;Perl et al., 2000;Spector et al., 2000!. Hence, the evolution of an active site likely destabilizes a protein. Indeed, when His119 of RNase A is mutated to an alanine residue, the conformational stability of the protein is increased by 0.3 kcal0mol at pH 6.0 and 1.1 kcal0mol at pH 1.2 ~Quirk et al., 1998!. This destabilization by active-site residues allows the protein to open along the interface defining the active site to form protein II o . The evolution of an active site could thus define the domain structure of a protein.\n\nProtein II is vulnerable to denaturation via protein II o . The open conformation of protein II o has fewer favorable intramolecular interactions than does the closed conformation of protein II. Protein III and protein III o have evolved stable domains without compromising the active site, as depicted by the shaded boxes in Figure 4. The stabilized domains could form a noncovalent com-plex, protein III N {protein III C , after proteolytic cleavage between the two domains. The individual domains, protein III N and protein III C , could even be stable ~or metastable! independently. RNase S is an example of the protein III N {protein III C complex. S-Protein, which is an example of protein III C , has a partially disordered but native-like structure ~Graziano et al., 1996!. Disulfide bonds seem to be responsible for the conformational stability of S-protein, as S-protein cannot form correct disulfide bonds once it is reduced in the absence of S-peptide ~Harber & Anfinsen, 1961!, which is an example of protein III N . S-Peptide also tends to fold into its native conformation, an a-helix ~Shoemaker et al., 1987!. The equilibrium between protein III and protein III o allows for the formation of protein III 2 , which is a primitive domain-swapped dimer with composite active sites but a high K d . The unstable RNase A dimer formed near neutral pH is an example of protein III 2 . Lyophilization of RNase A from 50% acetic acid induces dimerization because the acidic pH increases the population of the open conformation, protein III o ; and the lyophilization process increases the concentration of protein, which favors its dimerization to form protein III 2 . Dehydration could also enhance dimer formation by desolvating the C-and O-interfaces, and thereby favoring intermolecular association. Lyophilization from 50% acetic acid is likely to produce dimers in several different conformations, but only the metastable conformers are observed routinely ~Gotte & Libonati, 1998!.\n\nDomain swapping provides a dimerization interface without the need for multiple mutations in a monomer ~Bennett et al., 1995!. Still, domain swapping alone is unlikely to endow a dimer with stability. Swapping intramolecular interactions for identical intermolecular interactions in a domain-swapped dimer is likely to be isoenthalpic, and dimerization itself has a substantial entropic cost. If there were a phenotypic selection for the dimer, then its K d could become lower through mutations that stabilize the dimer ~e.g., development of an O-interface or evolution of intermolecular disulfide bonds! or destabilize the monomer ~e.g., deletion of residues between the two domains!. The efficacy of this latter strategy was demonstrated recently with human pancreatic ribonuclease, which forms a homodimer with K d ϭ 1.5 mM upon removal of five residues in the loop that links the S-peptide and S-protein domains ~Russo et al., 2000!. The result is protein IV, which is a stable domain-swapped dimer.\n\nThe role of domain swapping in the dimerization of BS-RNase has been controversial ~D 'Alessio, 1995'Alessio, , 1999a'Alessio, , 1999b!. !. If the integrity of the BS-RNase dimer is paramount, then the intermolecular disulfide bonds are most responsible for dimerization. After all, the dissociation energy of a disulfide bond far exceeds that of any known noncovalent interaction. Although domain swapping plays only a minor role in the stabilization of dimeric BS-RNase, it does dictate the location of the dimerization interface. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of BS-RNase originates from domain swapping, and not from the intermolecular disulfide bonds ~Cafaro et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1995!. The lack of evidence for unstable dimers, such as protein III 2 ~Fig. 4!, had suggested that stable dimers evolve directly from stable monomers. In contrast, we have discovered that RNase A has a predisposition @perhaps even a preadaptation ~Gould, 1977!# to form a dimer, albeit an unstable one, at neutral pH. The intrinsic ability of RNase A to form an unstable dimer indicates that evolution of a dimeric quaternary structure can be a continuous process. Assigning a particular mutation as being responsible for dimerization in such a continuous process would be arbitrary. Proteins have been subjected to natural selection as a result of the evolutionary pressures on the organisms that contain them ~Burbaum et al., 1989!. Hence, it would be most appropriate to ask: Which mutation provided a selectable phenotype for dimerization?\n\nWild-type RNase A and its H12A and H119A variants ~Thompson & Raines, 1995! were produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere ~delCardayré & Raines, 1994; Fisher et al., 1998b! with the following modifications. Inclusion bodies were resuspended in a minimal volume of solubilization buffer, which was 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer ~pH 8.0! containing guanidine-HCl ~7 M!, EDTA ~10 mM!, and dithiothreitol ~DTT! ~0.10 M!. This suspension was diluted 10-fold by adding 20 mM acetic acid slowly and with stirring. At this step, the dark brown solution turned turbid because of the precipitation of impurities. Reduced RNase A was still soluble after the dilution. The precipitant was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 ϫ g. The supernatant from the centrifugation was dialyzed against 20 mM acetic acid. The precipitant that developed during dialysis was also removed by centrifugation. The remaining supernatant was refolded as described ~delCardayré et al., 1995!. The removal of impurities by diluting the solubilized inclusion body with 20 mM acetic acid increased the yield of pure protein to 40-50 mg per 1 L of E. coli culture.\n\nA dimer of H12A RNase A and H119A RNase A was prepared as described elsewhere for the wild-type enzyme ~Crestfield et al., 1962;Liu et al., 1998!. The variants ~2.7 mg of each! were mixed, dialyzed against distilled H 2 O, and lyophilized. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in 50% ~v0v! acetic acid ~0.50 mL! to give a final concentration of 11 mg0mL, and incubated at 4 8C overnight. After the solution was lyophilized, the powder was dissolved in 0.50 mL of 0.20 M sodium phosphate buffer ~pH 6.5! and loaded on a Pharmacia FPLC HiLoad 26060 Superdex 75 gel filtration column, which had been equilibrated with 0.20 M sodium phosphate buffer ~pH 6.5!. Fractions corresponding to dimers were collected, and the concentration of dimer was determined spectroscopically by using E ϭ 0.72 mL mg Ϫ1 cm Ϫ1 at 277.5 nm ~Sela et al., 1957!. The yield of dimers was ;20%, which is similar to a value reported recently ~Liu et al., 1998!.\n\nRibonucleolytic activity was measured by monitoring cleavage of poly~C! with ultraviolet spectroscopy. The buffer was composed of 50 mM acetic acid, 50 mM MES, and 0.10 M Tris ~Ellis & Morrison, 1982! containing NaCl ~0.10 M!. The pH was adjusted to pH 7.0 with aqueous HCl. After buffer ~0.60 mL! containing poly~C! ~0.042-0.83 mM! was equilibrated at 25 8C, the reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme. The increase in absorbance at 250 nm was monitored and used to calculate the reaction rate with DE ϭ 2,380 M Ϫ1 cm Ϫ1 ~delCardayré & Raines, 1994!. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of kinetic data with the program SIGMAPLOT 5.0 ~SPSS, Chicago, Illinois!.\n\nThe dissociation of dimer was monitored by measuring the loss of ribonucleolytic activity. A solution of the H12A RNase A{H119A RNase A dimer ~6 mM! in 0.20 M sodium phosphate buffer ~pH 6.5! was heated to 37 or 65 8C. At known time intervals, small aliquots were removed and assayed for ribonucleolytic activity. When the dimer was incubated at 65 8C, the aliquots taken from the reaction were chilled on ice before assaying activity to suppress further reaction. Assays of ribonucleolytic activity were performed as described above, except that the concentration of poly~C! was 0.17 mM. Specific activities were calculated by dividing the observed rates by the concentration of enzyme monomer ~0.20 mM! in the assay mixtures.\n\na Specific activities are expressed as the mean ~6SE! of last three time points in Figures\n\na The designation is from Sorrentino et al. ~2000!.\n\nof"
