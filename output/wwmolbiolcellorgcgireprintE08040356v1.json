    "full_text": "The ability of cells to modulate their contacts with each other and the underlying matrix is essential for epithelial remodeling that occurs in development and cancer progression (Behrens, 1999;Kramer et al., 2005;Thiery, 2003). In particular, members of cadherin family of calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion molecules have been demonstrated to both suppress (Frixen et al., 1991), and promote (Islam et al., 1996), cell migration and invasion. While classic cadherins assemble into intercellular adhesive structures known as adherens junctions that associate with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, desmosomal cadherins, including desmogleins and desmocollins, make up the adhesive core of desmosomes, which anchor intermediate filaments (IF) to sites of strong intercellular adhesion (Green and Simpson, 2007).\n\nAnchorage to the IF cytoskeleton is established with the cooperation of the desmosomal cadherin associated proteins plakoglobin and plakophilins, which in turn link the IF associated protein desmoplakin (DP) to the membrane complex. Desmosomes provide mechanical integrity to epithelial and heart tissues by redistributing the forces of mechanical stress (Godsel et al., 2004). In addition, desmosomal cadherins have more recently emerged as playing a role in tissue morphogenesis (Chidgey and Dawson, 2007;Dusek et al., 2007;Runswick et al., 2001).\n\nIn spite of desmosomes' importance in tissue function, most studies have focused on the contribution of classic cadherins to epithelial remodeling. Classic cadherins engage in bi-directional signaling with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), whereby they are both responsive to, and can trigger, signals that regulate cell behavior (McLachlan and Yap, 2007;Wheelock and Johnson, 2003). E-, N-, and VE-cadherin ectodomains are also subject to shedding via matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (Llorens et al., 1998;Lochter et al., 1997;Noe et al., 2001), including the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family of transmembrane sheddases (Maretzky et al., 2005;Najy et al., 2008;Reiss et al., 2005;Schulz et al., 2008). Both phosphorylation of the cadherin complex and MMP-dependent processing of cadherins can also regulate the availability of a pool of non-junctional catenins, which propagate signals that can regulate cell growth, differentiation and motility (Conacci-Sorrell et al., 2002;Nelson and Nusse, 2004) While our understanding of the role of desmosomal modulation in tissue homeostasis and remodeling is not well understood, changes in desmosomal cadherin expression, phosphorylation and function are known to occur during tissue morphogenesis and tumor progression (Chidgey and Dawson, 2007;Dusek et al., 2007;Green and Simpson, 2007;Muller et al., 2008;Runswick et al., 2001). Our previous work suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in many tumor types (Kalyankrishna and Grandis, 2006;Rogers et al., 2005), regulates desmosome assembly and function in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, by decreasing the level and cell surface localization of desmosomal cadherins (Lorch et al., 2004). The resulting weakened intercellular adhesive strength was accompanied by phosphorylation of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) and associated proteins (which occurred preferentially on desmosomal and not classic cadherins), and MMP-dependent shedding of the Dsg2 ectodomain. EGFR inhibition reversed these effects. However, the mechanism by which EGFR inhibition stabilizes intercellular desmosomal cadherins is not understood.\n\nEndocytic trafficking of classic cadherins has emerged as an important mechanism to regulate adhesion during epithelial remodeling. E-cadherin trafficking can occur through clathrin-dependent, clathrin-independent, and caveolae-dependent pathways, and can be regulated by RTKs (Bryant and Stow, 2004;Lu et al., 2003). In addition to regulating interactions with the cytoskeleton, RTK-dependent phosphorylation of cadherins and their associated proteins can contribute to the internalization and/or diversion of cadherins to a lysosomal degradation pathway (d 'Azzo et al., 2005;Fujita et al., 2002;McLachlan and Yap, 2007). However, the contribution of desmosomal cadherin regulation to epithelial remodeling via endocytic trafficking has not been addressed, nor is the involvement of RTKs or MMPs understood. The importance of RTKs and MMPs in epithelial remodeling processes is highlighted by the well-established role of erbB family members in tumor progression, and recent recognition that ADAM family members are aberrantly expressed in certain cancers (Borrell-Pages et al., 2003;Rocks et al., 2008).\n\nHere, we ask whether EGFR inhibition stabilizes intercellular Dsg2 by regulating endocytic trafficking of this molecule. Our results indicate that EGFR regulates Dsg2 trafficking, and does so in part through an ADAM-dependent pathway. While E-cadherin internalization is also regulated by EGFR in SCC68 cells, responsiveness to MMP inhibitors is muted compared with Dsg2. Importantly, this differential responsiveness is mirrored by functional data showing that intercellular adhesive strength in control cells increases in response to both EGFR and MMP inhibition, but Dsg2 is specifically required for the response to MMP inhibitors. Collectively, these data support the idea that different modes of regulation exist for these cadherin family members.\n\nOur previous results showed that EGFR inhibition interferes with MMPdependent shedding of the desmosomal cadherin Dsg2, while also resulting in its redistribution from the cytoplasm to intercellular junctions, even in reduced calcium where desmosomes do not typically form. Classic cadherins have previously been\n\nshown to be depleted from the cell surface by endocytic internalization (Le et al., 1999).\n\nThis suggested to us that EGFR inhibition may be able to override signals that promote internalization of desmosomal cadherins under reduced calcium conditions. Here we ask whether EGFR decreases cell surface Dsg2 by regulating endocytic trafficking and explore the role MMP-dependent shedding has in this process.\n\nTo compare the relative abilities of EGFR and MMP inhibitors to stabilize Dsg2 at cell-cell interfaces, SCC68 cells in 0.25 mM calcium were treated with vehicle only (DMSO), the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor TAPI-0 (TAPI), or the ErbB1/2 inhibitor PKI166 (PKI), and analyzed by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy. While similar results were seen at all calcium concentrations, an intermediate concentration was selected from a range between 0.09 and 1.0 mM calcium as optimal for observing Dsg2 cleavage and internalization. At lower concentrations Dsg2 levels were decreased due to its instability and at higher concentrations cleavage/internalization was somewhat attenuated most likely due to junctional stabilization. Importantly, however, as discussed below, similar results were seen at physiological calcium concentrations (Fig. S1).\n\nLike PKI and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibitor C225 (Lorch et al., 2004), TAPI treatment led to a dramatic redistribution of Dsg2 to intercellular borders (Fig. 1A,B). In contrast, there was little impact on the extent to which cell-cell interfaces were occupied by E-cadherin, although both inhibitors resulted in a more organized appearance of this classic cadherin (Fig. 1A,B). To test whether Dsg2 redistribution correlated with an increase in intercellular adhesive strength, epithelial sheets treated with DMSO, PKI or the broad spectrum MMP inhibitors GM6001 (Fig 1C) or TAPI (not shown), were released with dispase and subjected to mechanical shear stress as described (Hudson et al., 2004). Like EGFR inhibition, MMP inhibition increased epithelial sheet integrity in a calcium-dependent manner, even at the highest concentration, supporting the physiological relevance of MMP-dependent affects on intercellular adhesion (Fig. 1C).\n\nTo begin to address the mechanism of Dsg2 cell surface stabilization, we first asked whether Dsg2 and E-cadherin are internalized in SCC68 cells using two complementary approaches (Le et al., 1999) (Fig. 2). Cells were incubated at 4 deg C either with antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of Dsg2 or E-cadherin, or with biotin, and then switched to 37 deg C to allow internalization. At time points beginning at 5 min, internalization was analyzed either by stripping the surface label and subsequently analyzing the internal pool using labeled secondary antibody or by streptavidin pull down followed by immunoblotting, respectively.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2A, under baseline conditions where EGFR is active, Dsg2 and E-cadherin were rapidly internalized at 37 deg. Both cadherins were detected as early as 5 min and accumulated over time, the levels decreasing beginning at 90 min presumably due to degradation of the internalized pool and/or recycling back to the surface (Fig. 2B,C).\n\nBoth full length and a 100kDa cell-retained Dsg2 fragment, previously shown to result from MMP-dependent processing of Dsg2 (Lorch et al., 2004), appeared in the internalized pool over a similar time course. Importantly, internalization occurred at calcium concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 1mM, supporting the physiological relevance of the process (Figs. 2, S1 and not shown).\n\nBoth Dsg2 and E-cadherin undergo EGFR-dependent internalization, but internalization of Dsg2 is more sensitive to MMP inhibition\n\nTo test whether the redistribution of Dsg2 in response to TAPI and PKI was due to interference with the accumulation of the internalized pool of cadherins, antibody internalization and biotinylation assays were performed in cells pretreated with PKI (or the mAb C225) or TAPI, to block EGFR and MMP activities, respectively. PKI and the mAb C225 interfered with the appearance of both Dsg2 and E-cadherin, but not transferrin, in an internalized pool (Fig. 3A,B and not shown). However, Dsg2 appeared to be more responsive than E-cadherin to TAPI inhibition in both antibody internalization and biotinylation assays (Fig. 3A-D). The extent to which the responsiveness to TAPI differed depended somewhat on the conditions of the experiment, but differences were observed at all calcium concentrations tested (Fig. 3 and S1). GM6001 also interfered with internalization triggered by acute treatment with EGF following cell starvation at a higher calcium concentration (Fig. S1A).\n\nTo corroborate these findings, we examined the behavior of a C-terminally GFPtagged Dsg2 in control, PKI-or TAPI-treated living cells using time lapse live cell imaging (Fig. 4 and accompanying videos). GFP-labeled Dsg2 particles exhibited rapid movements in the cortical region of the cells treated with vehicle, DMSO (Fig. 4A and video 1). While some particles appeared loosely tethered to the plasma membrane, they were also observed to uncouple from the membrane and move in a retrograde direction into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 arrows and video 1). An increase in Dsg2 was observed at cell-cell interfaces in the TAPI-(Fig. 4 and video 2) and PKI-treated (Fig. 4 and video 3) cells, and fluorescent puncta appeared to be more stably associated with cell-cell interfaces, as one would expect for more mature junctions. Collectively, these experiments strongly support the idea that EGFR and MMPs de-stabilize Dsg2 at cellcell interfaces by elevating the level of an internalized pool of cadherin at the expense of the adhesion-competent junctional pool.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1C, alterations in cadherin trafficking resulting from EGFR or MMP-inhibition are accompanied by increased intercellular adhesive strength. To assess the specific contribution of Dsg2, we examined cellular responses to PKI or TAPI in Dsg2-deficient dispase-released epithelial sheets without further mechanical stress applied to the cultures. Under these conditions control cultures held together, whereas Dsg2 deficient cultures dissociated (5A,B), even though E-cadherin was still present (Fig. 5C). Importantly, while PKI treatment of the Dsg2-deficient cultures protected them from dissociation, loss of Dsg2 resulted in failure of the cultures to respond to TAPI treatment. These support the idea that the sensitivity of Dsg2 trafficking to TAPI-treatment translates into physiologically relevant increase in adhesive strength, specifically due to its action on this desmosomal cadherin. These data do not rule out a contribution for EGFR-dependent regulation of Dsg2 trafficking in adhesion, but suggest that the presence of classic cadherins is sufficient for a cellular response to EGFR inhibition.\n\nBased on the observed role for MMPs in de-stabilizing intercellular Dsg2, we set out to further characterize Dsg2 processing and identify the responsible MMP. We previously showed that MMP-dependent Dsg2 processing generates a cell-associated 100kDa band that is reduced by EGFR inhibition, and an ectodomain fragment shed into the medium (Lorch et al., 2004). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Dsg2 with antibodies recognizing specific extra-and intracellular domains of Dsg2, and subsequent immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against the terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain indicated that the 100kDa cleavage product comprises the entire Dsg2 cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and an extracellular juxtamembrane domain (Fig. S2). Dsg2 shedding occurred in a panel of SCC lines (not shown), including SCC13 cells constitutively overexpressing ectopic EGFR but not in their control counterparts (McCawley et al., 1997). Desmosomal cadherin shedding was greatest in the SCC68 line, which was thus chosen for use throughout this study.\n\nIn addition to being blocked by TAPI, Dsg2 proteolysis was enhanced by PMA treatment, which is known to stimulate the activity of ADAM family member proteases Unexpectedly, ADAM10 knock down resulted in increased levels of the 100kDa fragment, raising the possibility that ADAM10 may be involved in further processing of this fragment. To determine the specificity of the ADAM17 siRNA and to test for the possible involvement of ADAM9 or ADAM15, both of which have recently been linked to classic cadherin regulation (Hirao et al., 2006;Najy et al., 2008), we compared cells treated with ADAM9, 10, 15 and 17 RNAis for Dsg2 processing (Fig. S3). Interestingly, ADAM15, and to a lesser extent ADAM9, also impaired cleavage of Dsg2, without having any off target effects on the mature forms of the other ADAM family members, indicating that Dsg2 shedding may be regulated by multiple ADAMs.\n\nRecently it was shown that EGFR regulates ADAM17 by increasing the half life of ADAM17 protein and consequently the level of mature ADAM17 in A431 cells (Santiago-Josefat et al., 2007). Therefore, we were surprised when we observed that EGFR inhibition by PKI increased ADAM17 (both pro-and mature forms) in SCC68 cells despite decreased cleavage of Dsg2 under these conditions (Fig. S4). To reconcile these findings we investigated ADAM17 distribution in PKI-treated cultures.\n\nWhile Dsg2 accumulated at cell-cell interfaces in PKI-treated cells, ADAM17 staining remained predominantly in the cell center, presumably at the dorsal cell surface and/or in intracellular vesicles. Thus, EGFR inhibition shifts the pool of Dsg2 spatially away from the ADAM17-rich compartment, which likely explains at least in part why Dsg2 cleavage is diminished in spite of the increased levels of protease, but not completely abrogated, in PKI treated cells. Differences in our results from those reported by Santiago-Josefat may be due to cell type specific differences in the mechanism responsible for regulating ADAM17.\n\nTo test whether inhibition of ADAM17 interferes with accumulation of an internalized pool of Dsg2, we carried out antibody and biotinylation assays following transfection with ADAM17 siRNA. While there was some variability in the level to which the pro-and mature forms of ADAM17 were reduced by KD, we consistently observed the loss of a dispersed cytoplasmic pool of ADAM17 that partially overlapped with Dsg2 staining, with more variable retention of a resistant particulate pool (Fig. 8C  cleavage product in SCC68 cells, it also led to an increase in the internalized pool of Dsg2 (Fig. 8D,E). Collectively, our data suggest that the balance of different MMP activities is likely to play an important role in controlling the extent to which specific cadherins are stabilized at the cell surface and in intercellular junctions during epithelial remodeling.\n\nWhile recent studies have identified classic cadherin trafficking as a potential mechanism for regulating tumor cell behavior (Bryant and Stow, 2004;D'Souza-Schorey, 2005;Yap et al., 2007), the possibility that altered trafficking of desmosomal cadherins contribute to loss of tumor cell adhesion had not been addressed previously.\n\nHere we show that the desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 2, is constitutively internalized in SCC tumor cells.\n\nOur results suggest furthermore that ErbB1/2 or MMP inhibition results in an accumulation of junctional Dsg2 and depletion of the internalized pool, and this redistribution is accompanied by increased intercellular adhesion. The importance of such a post-translational mechanism in regulating Dsg2 expression is supported by S 35 -pulse labeling experiments showing that neither TAPI nor PKI alter Dsg2 protein synthesis (J. Chen, unpublished results). Our data indicate furthermore that Dsg2 trafficking is more sensitive to MMP inhibitors than E-cadherin trafficking, and that Dsg2 is required for increased adhesive strength observed in MMP-inhibited epithelial sheets in SCC68 cells.\n\nWe have previously demonstrated that Dsg2 shedding occurs in an MMPdependent fashion (Lorch et al., 2004). Subsequently, ADAM10 was shown to shed Nand E-cadherin from the surface and reduce adhesion of neuronal and epithelial cells (Maretzky et al., 2005;Reiss et al., 2005), and Dsg2 was recently identified by a proteomics approach as a substrate for both ADAM10 and 17 (Bech-Serra et al., 2006).\n\nHowever, a possible role for ADAM10 or 17 in endocytic turnover of cadherins had not been previously examined. Our current data support the idea that stabilization of Dsg2 at cell-cell junctions in TAPI-treated and ADAM17-deficient cells occurs through regulation of Dsg2 endocytic trafficking. The inhibition of Dsg2 cleavage observed in ADAM9 and 15 deficient cells raises the possibility that a spectrum of sheddases may regulate Dsg2 trafficking and accumulation in intercellular junctions. ADAM10 knock down does not prevent Dsg2 cleavage, but results in an increase in the accumulation of a Dsg2 100kDa fragment, suggesting it may be involved in further processing of this fragment. The increase in this cell bound fragment correlates with an increase in internalized Dsg2, supporting the idea that its presence may contribute to regulation of Dsg2 trafficking (Fig. 9). While it is clear that ADAM17 silencing effectively blocks both Dsg2 processing and accumulation of internalized Dsg2, it is not known whether Dsg2 cleavage is solely responsible for ADAM17's role in Dsg2 trafficking. Although the complexity of previously characterized ADAM cleavage sites has made developing cleavage resistant mutant substrates challenging, in the future, such an approach might be possible once the precise site of cleavage is mapped (Hattori et al., 2000).\n\nOur data are consistent with a model in which EGFR and ADAMs cooperate to promote ectodomain shedding, internalization and, ultimately, degradation of Dsg2 (Fig. 9). Supporting the existence of an interdependent pathway is the observed decrease in ADAM-dependent Dsg2 fragment production in PKI-treated cells. Our data suggest that this effect is due to recruitment of Dsg2 to intercellular borders where it is protected from further degradation, despite a concomitant increase in ADAM17 protease under these conditions. Since EGFR is still active in TAPI-and ADAM17 siRNA-treated cultures, it seems unlikely that the reverse is true, i.e., ADAM17 regulates Dsg2 internalization by generating erbB family ligands.\n\nImportantly, PKI interferes with Dsg2 internalization under conditions where ADAM17 is still active, supporting the idea that ADAM-dependent proteolysis is not solely responsible for regulating accumulation of the internalized pool and suggesting that other EGFR-dependent events are involved. It has been shown that HGFdependent tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin can lead to recruitment of enzymes that ubiquitinate the cadherin compex, which in turn regulates its internalization or degradation (Fujita et al., 2002;Palacios et al., 2005). Likewise, the previously observed tyrosine phosphorylation of Dsg2 and its associated proteins (Lorch et al., 2004) may be required for efficient internalization. One model that is consistent with our data is that an EGFR-dependent event, such as phosphorylation of the desmosomal cadherin complex, regulates internalization, whereas the presence of processed Dsg2 in the desmosomal cadherin complex regulates the commitment to a degradative versus recycling pathway. In this scenario, either PKI or MMP inhibition would be predicted to interfere with accumulation of the internal pool of Dsg2, as shown here. While posttranslational modification of the Dsg2 tail could theoretically also regulate ectodomain cleavage, removal of most of the ~500 amino acid Dsg2 tail, including the EGFRdependent phosphorylation sites, does not prevent ectodomain cleavage, making this possibility seem less likely (Chen and Green, unpublished data).\n\nInternalization of classic cadherins occurs via both clathrin-dependent andindependent pathways (Bryant et al., 2007;Bryant and Stow, 2004;D'Souza-Schorey, 2005;Lu et al., 2003;Paterson et al., 2003). However, little is known about trafficking pathways in which desmosomal cadherins are engaged. Pathogenic antibodies from patients with the cutaneous blistering disease, pemphigus vulgaris, drive the internalization of desmoglein 3 in epidermal keratinocytes (Calkins et al., 2006) accompanied by its depletion from desmosomes (Yamamoto et al., 2007), but the mechanism of internalization and turnover has not been elucidated. Our preliminary data are consistent with the internalization of Dsg2 into a non-conventional pool that co-distributes poorly if at all with common early endosomal or lysosomal markers (not shown). The possibility that desmosomes are turned over from the plasma membrane through a non-conventional route has been suggested by early studies in which acute, EGTA-mediated, calcium depletion led to clathrin-independent half desmosome internalization into a compartment that appeared distinct from typical endosomes and lysosomes (Burdett, 1993;Holm et al., 1993). However, mechanisms of internalization stimulated by these acute treatments may differ considerably from those responsible for the EGFR-and MMP-dependent internalization shown here.\n\nIn conclusion, our data establish novel pathways for regulating desmosomal cadherin trafficking and desmoglein-dependent adhesion. The possibility that these pathways affect E-cadherin and Dsg2 differently underscores the importance of understanding the specific roles of desmosomal cadherins in epithelial remodeling and cancer, and suggests new strategies for therapeutic intervention based on tissue-specific variation in cadherin, RTK and MMP status.\n\nWhole cell lysates were generated in urea sample buffer, and total protein was quantified using the Amido Black Assay (Sheffield et al., 1987). Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotting was performed as described (Kowalczyk et al., 1997). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 4B2 (1:1000), 6D8 (1:1000), Dg3.1 (1:1000), HECD-1 (1:1000), Ab12 (1:500), AB19026 (1:1000), AB19027 (1:1000), ab11531 (1:1000), AB19036 (1:1000), clone H68.4 (1:1000), E7 (1:500), 12G10 (1:1000), ab9845 (1:1000), PY99 (1:200) and HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit (1:5000). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence.\n\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4Â°C. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating cleared supernatant with 3-5 Âµl of the appropriate antibody followed by 40 Âµl gamma-bind sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) overnight at 4Â°C. Immune complexes were released using reducing Laemmli buffer at 95Â°C and analyzed by immunoblot.\n\nCells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed in PBS, fixed in anhydrous methanol for 2 min at -20Â°C and incubated with 6D8 (1:100), HECD-1 (1:100) or sc-25782 (1:500). In some experiments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 or methanol. Primary antibodies were visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400). Coverslips were examined with a Leica upright microscope (model DMR) and images captured using Hamamatsu Orca digital camera (model C4742-95) and MetaMorph 6.1 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). To quantify border staining, 75 borders were examined, and the length of the border occupied by Dsg2 or E-cad staining was scored as follows: one-third (black), two-thirds (gray) or the entire (white) border.\n\nA cDNA construct encoding human Dsg2 in pBluescript R3 BptII SR (p594) (gift from Drs. W. Franke and S. Schafer (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to generate a Dsg2-FLAG-EGFP chimera. The stop codon was replaced with a C-terminal FLAG epitope followed by a BamH1 restriction site. This FLAG-tagged human Dsg2 cDNA was subcloned in frame with the EGFP sequence of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) using BamHI and the resulting plasmid was termed p1105. The entire Dsg2-FLAG-EGFP chimeric cDNA, was then subcloned into the LZRS-Linker retroviral vector (p989) (Denning et al., 2002) in the forward orientation using XhoI and NotI and named p1106. Retroviral supernatants containing the full-length Dsg2-FLAG-EGFP were generated using Phoenix amphotropic cell lines and SCC68 cell lines transduced as previously described (Getsios et al., 2004).\n\nCells expressing Dsg2-GFP were seeded on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass slides (Nunc) at 70-80% confluency. The next day, cells were cultured in 0.25 mM calcium containing media in the presence of DMSO, TAPI or PKI at 37Â°C for 7-8 hrs prior to imaging. Time-lapse images were obtained from a single plane at 3 sec intervals using 100x (HCX PLAN APO, N/A 1.35) with an Application Solution Multidimensional Workstation (ASMDWQ, Leica), equipped with a DMIRE2 inverted microscope with a Coolsnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific) and 37Â°C climate chamber.\n\nImages were processed using ASMDW and Metamorph 6.1 (Universal Imaging Corp) imaging software.\n\nCells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS, at the appropriate calcium concentration, and incubated with 2 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce Chemical Co, Rockford, IL) for 30 min at 4Â°C. Excess biotin was removed with PBS (3X), and internalization of biotin-labeled surface proteins was allowed to proceed at 37Â°C for the indicated times in prewarmed culture media containing inhibitors, when indicated. Cells were returned to 4Â°C and washed with PBS (3X). Residual biotin was stripped from the cell surface by washing with 100 mM sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) (3X, 20 min).\n\nCells were washed with 120 mM iodoacetamide (1X, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and PBS (3X) to quench residual MESNA and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors.\n\nLysates were vortexed for a minute, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and recovered supernatants were normalized for total protein using the Amido Black Assay. 20 Âµl of lysate was removed to serve as an input. Biotinylated proteins were retrieved with 25-40 Âµl UltraLink immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) by end over end rotation at 4Â°C overnight and washed with RIPA buffer (4X). Complexes were released using reducing Laemmli buffer at 95Â°C and analyzed using immunblot analysis as described above.\n\nDensitometric analysis of band intensity was performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). To quantify internalization, the ratio of cytoplasmic/surface intensity was determined after normalizing to tubulin.\n\nCells grown on coverslips were incubated at 4Â°C for 1 hr with 6D8 (1:00) or HECD-1\n\n(1:100) in KSFM containing 3% BSA and 20 mM HEPES. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with PBS (3X), at the appropriate calcium concentration.\n\nInternalization of surface bound antibody was stimulated at 37Â°C for the indicated times in prewarmed culture media containing inhibitors, when indicated. After returning to 4Â°C, coverslips were washed with PBS (3X), and residual antibody was stripped from the cell surface by acid washing (0.5 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM acetic acid; 4X,15 min). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and unwashed antibody was quenched with goat anti-mouse (1:10). Coverslips were washed with PBS (3X) and processed using indirect immunofluorescence as described above. To quantify internalization, the cytoplasmic fluorescence of 75-100 cells was measured for each timepoint using Metamorph Imaging. Data are expressed as average cytoplasmic intensity + SEM.\n\nConfluent cell cultures were washed with PBS and incubated with 2.4 U/ml dispase for 30 min at 37Â°C. Released monolayers were either analyzed directly without applying mechanical stress, or transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and washed with PBS (2X).\n\nTubes were inverted (0.09 mM = 0 inversions, 0.50 mM = 5-10 inversions, 1.0 mM = >10 inversions) and fragments were counted with a dissecting scope (Leica, MZ6) as described (Hudson, et al, 2004) or imaged with a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera (model C4742-95) and analyzed using MetaVue imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Data are expressed as average number of fragments + SD. Statistical analysis was determined using a Student's t test. strengthens intercellular adhesion. (A) SCC68 cells were treated overnight with DMSO, TAPI-0 (TAPI) or PKI166 (PKI) in medium containing 0.25 mM CaCl 2 . Indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the cellular localization of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) and E-cadherin (E-cad). Bar, 20 Âµm. (B) Staining along the border was quantified as follows: one-third border occupied (black), two-thirds (gray) or entire (white) border. TAPI and PKI-treated cells showed increased intercellular Dsg2, but not E-cad, localization. (C) Confluent monolayers of SCC68 cells were cultured overnight in the presence of DMSO, GM6001 (GM) or PKI in 0.09, 0.50 or 1.0 mM CaCl 2 . Intercellular adhesion was measured by counting the number of fragments generated from dispase-released monolayers subjected to a defined amount of mechanical stress. At 0.50 mM and 1.0 mM calcium, significantly fewer fragments were produced in the TAPI and PKI-treated monolayers (p<.05). of 0.25 mM CaCl 2 overnight. (A) Dsg2 and E-cadherin (E-cad) were labeled with monoclonal antibodies directed against their extracellular domains at 4Â°C. Internalization of the surface labeled proteins was allowed for 5, 15, 30 or 60 min at 37Â°C. Residual antibody was stripped from the cell surface using an acid wash, and internalized Dsg2 and E-cad were visualized using indirect immunofluorescence. Bar, 20 Âµm. (B) Cells were incubated with biotin at 4Â°C and then switched to 37Â°C to allow internalization to proceed for 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min or 3, 4, 6, 8 or 24 hrs. After  pool of Dsg2. (A) SCC68 cells were cultured overnight with DMSO, TAPI or PKI in 0.25 mM CaCl 2 . Dsg2 and E-cadherin (E-cad) monoclonal antibodies were used to measure internalization after 60 min. Bar, 20 Âµm. (B) Internalization was quantified by measuring the cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity using Metamorph Imaging. (C) SCC68 cells were incubated with DMSO, TAPI or PKI overnight in the presence of 0.09 mM calcium, and cell surface biotinylation was performed as described to measure internalization after 60 min. (D) The ratio of cytoplasmic/surface intensity was used to measure internalization. PKI effectively blocked the accumulation of Dsg2 and E-cad, whereas TAPI was more effective inhibiting the appearance of internalized Dsg2. expressing Dsg2-GFP were cultured for 8 hrs with DMSO, TAPI or PKI in 0.25 mM calcium containing media. Cells were imaged at 3-sec intervals for 20 min. Bar, 10 Âµm.  cells. SCC68 cells were transfected with GAPDH or Dsg2 siRNA. 96 hrs posttransfection, cells were cultured overnight in DMSO, TAPI or PKI in 0.25 mM calcium containing media. (A) Confluent monolayers of SCC68 cells were released using dispase. (B) Intercellular adhesion was measured by counting the number of fragments generated without applying mechanical stress. (C) Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates using antibodies against Dsg2, E-cadherin, GAPDH and tubulin. Fragmentation was observed in the TAPI-treated monolayers when Dsg2 was knocked down. transfected with reagent alone, GAPDH, ADAM10 or ADAM17 siRNA in 0.25 mM calcium containing media. Western blot analysis using antibodies against Dsg2, ADAM10, ADAM17, GAPDH and tubulin was performed on whole cell lysates prepared 96 h post-transfection. ADAM17, but not ADAM10, knockdown inhibited the cleavage of Dsg2. (B) Prior to harvesting, SCC68 cells were treated with DMSO, PMA or TAPI overnight. The PMA-induced increase in Dsg2 cleavage was prevented in response to ADAM17 knockdown.  (A) SCC68 cells were transfected with GAPDH or ADAM17 siRNA in media containing 0.25 mM CaCl 2 and analyzed 48 hr post-transfection. Cell surface Dsg2 was labeled with antibody, and internalization was assessed after 60 min at 37Â°C. ADAM17 localization was assessed using indirect immunofluorescence. Bar, 20 Âµm. (B) The average cytoplasmic intensity was measured using Metamorph Imaging. (C) Western blot analysis of Dsg2, ADAM17 and tubulin. ADAM17 was reduced by 65% percent under these conditions (C top panel), and the residual ADAM17 exhibits a particulate pattern that appears distinct from Dsg2 staining (C bottom, right panel). (D,E) Cell surface biotinylation was performed to measure internalization after 60 min in GAPDH, ADAM10 or ADAM17 knock down cells 96 hrs post-transfection. Tubulin blot from RIPA lysates is shown to demonstrate equal starting material for all the samples. Cytoplasmic Dsg2 staining was absent in ADAM17 knockdown cells. overnight in KSFM containing 0.09 mM calcium, cells were switched to 0.25 mM   overnight in KSFM containing 0.09 mM calcium, cells were switched to 0.25 mM calcium and treated with PKI.
