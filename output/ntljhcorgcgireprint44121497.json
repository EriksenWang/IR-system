    "full_text": "Apoptosis is involved in maintenance of tissue homeostasis and regulation of cell numbers in tissues (Kerr et al., 1972). A key feature of cells undergoing apoptosis is rapid breakdown of their genomic DNA into fragments of multiples of about 180-200 BP (Wyllie, 1980). On the basis ofdetection ofDNA fragmentation at the singlecell level, several techniques for in situ labeling of apoptotic cells have been described, the most common of which is the TdTmediated biotin dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) technique (Gavrieli et al., 1992). We succeeded in combining this technique with RNA in situ hybridization for detection of gene expression. This new technique will be helpful in the microtopographical analysis of apoptosis-related gene expression with respect to zones of apoptosis. In situ hybridization was performed using a probe specific for the human CD95 (APO-1IFas) ligand (CD95L) gene, the product of which is known to induce apoptosis by oligomerization of its receptor on CD95-expressing and -sensitive target cells (Suda et al., 1993;Dhein et al., 1992).\n\nTissue. Partial thymectomy specimens were obtained from l-monthto 3-year-old children undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The tissue reached a streptavidin-peroxidase system. This double labeling technique produced a distinct, dark qtoplasmic staining of\n\nCD95L \"A-expressing cells and an intense red nuclear precipitate in apoptoric cells or bodies. This technique will be a useful tool for microtopographical analysis of apoptosisrelated gene exptession.

For the staining procedure, paraffin sections about 4 pm thick were adhered to slides precoated with 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane (Sigma; St Louis. MO), dried overnight at 37'C. dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol-water baths of descending ethanol concentrations, and finally immersed in standard PBS.\n\nRobes for In Situ Hybridization. Probes were synthesized using &rent parts of the exon regions of the CD95L gene as template. After extensive testing of the different exon-specific probes, the one that gave the best signal-to-noise ratio was used for the experiment: tAPO-IL, a human CD95L exon 4-specific oligonucleotide (sequence: 5'-CCT CCG TCA E A CCA GAT CCT GGG GAT ACT TAG AGT TCC K A TG-Y) corresponding to BP 679-636 of the human CD95L open reading frame. PromZ, a human CD95L promoter-specific probe (sequence: 5'-CAC E A CCA TIC TCC TGT AGC TG-3') corresponding to BP -422 to -444 was used as a negative control. Oligonucleotides were labeled with the DIG-Oligonucleotide 3'-End Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim; Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double Labeling Technique. For simultaneous in situ detection of CD95L \"A-expressing and apoptotic cells, we established a double labeling technique, performing in situ hybridization and the TUNEL technique successively on the same tissue section. For detection of CD95L mRNAexpressing cells, sections were digested for 30 min at 37'C by 3 pg/ml proteinase K (Merck Darmstadt, Germany) in 50 mM Xis-HC1 (pH 7.6) supplemented with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP Sigma) for inhibition of nucleases. Slides were then extensively rinsed with DEP-supplemented 50 mM liis-HC1 (pH 7.6). and in situ hybridization was carried out at 37'C overnight using probes at 0.05 pM in standard PBS. This was followed by extensive washing at room temperature with standard PBS containing 0.5 % Tween 20 (Serva; Heidelberg, Germany) and immersion of the slides in PBS supplemented with 0.8% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Serva) and 0.1% coldwater f & skin gelatin (CWFS, Aurion, Wagcningen, Netherlands) for 10 min. After 2 hr of incubation with a gold-labeled sheep antidigoxigenin F(ab2) fragment (Aurion) dissolved in PBS-BSA-CWFS and repeated washings and fmation of the slides by 2% glutaraldehyde in standard PBS for 5 min. gold particles were visualized for light microscopy using a silver enhancement kit (Aurion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTo highlight apoptotic thymocytes in the same section, a modifcd TdTmediated biotin dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method was now applied (Strater et al., 1995). Sections were immersed in 10 mM citrate buffer and irradiated in a microwave oven (750 W) for 1 min. Then they were re-digested for 15 min with 20 pglml proteinase K in PBS, washed twice in PBS. and transferred to TdT buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCI (Roth; Karlsruhe, Germany), 140 mM sodium cacodylate (Serva), and 1 mM cobalt chloride (Sigma). Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT Promega, Madison, WI) was used at a final concentration of 0.1 Ulp1 in TdT buffer to insert biotin-16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) at the 3' ends of the DNA fragments. A streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Amersham; High Wycombe. UK) at appropriate concentration in PBS and 3-amino-9ethylcarbazole (AEC Sigma) served as a detection system for bound biotinylated deoxyuridine. Negative controls were carried out by incubating sections with biotinylated dUTP in TdT buffer while omitting TdT. Finally, sections were lightly counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin and mounted with glycerol gelatin.\n\nThe above procedure yielded a double staining that allowed codetection of mRNA and DNA breaks in formalin-fixed tissue. As shown in Figure la, the double labeling procedure gave rise to intense, dark granular staining of he cytoplasm of CD95L \"Aexpressing cells and distinct nuclear labeling of cells undergoing apoptosis. Most cells detected by the TUNEL technique already exhibited clear-cut morphological signs of programmed cell death. The nonspecific background obtained by the silver enhancement and peroxidase reaction was low, and both signals were clearly discernible. Importantly, no red cytoplasmic precipitate in CD95L \"A-expressing cells was seen, demonstrating that possible postlabeling of the DNA probe by TUNEL, if it occurred at all, was below the threshold.\n\nSpecific labeling of CD95L \"A-expressing cells was completely inhibited when in situ hybridization was performed using the unlabeled exon-specific probe or the digoxigenin-labeled promoter-specific probe (Figure Ib). Detection of apoptotic bodies, on the other hand, was not compromised. The same resuit was obtained by prehybridization with the unlabeled exon-specific probe before hybridization with the digoxigenin-conjugated 1.APO-IL (data not shown). Likewise, when the nonconjugated exon-specific probe was applied, no red cytoplasmic precipitate due to possible TdT-mediated end-labeling of the DNA probe was observed, thus excluding a possible interference of both reactions.\n\nOn the other hand, when TdT was omitted during the nick endlabeling step, only CD95L mRNA-expressing cells were detected by the double staining procedure, and apoptotic bodies were not labeled (Figure IC).\n\nApoptosis is a form of cell death originally defined purely on morphological grounds (Kerr, 1971). It soon became clear that apoptosis is executed on the basis of a genetic program. This program can be triggered by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli (for review IN SITU DETECTION OF mRNA AND APOPTOSIS 1499 see, e.g., Cohen et al., 1992). Susceptibility of single cells to induction of apoptosis after these stimuli is influenced by the expression of different genes, e.g., the anti-apoptotic 6cl-2 gene (Oltvai and Korsmeyer, 1994). Most functional data on the regulation of apoptosis have come from in vitro studies. Their relevance to the in vivo situation, however, is not always evident. Therefore, several techniques for the in situ study of apoptosis have been described (Wijsman et al., 1993;Gavrieli et al., 1992). Although these techniques are very useful to identify apoptotic cells or bodies in tissue sections, they do not contribute to elucidation of conditioning for apoptosis of the cells detected. A method allowing detection of both apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation and gene expression on an mRNA level in the same tissue section would be a considerable advance in the in situ study of programmed cell death.\n\nHere we present a new technique combining RNA in situ hybridization and the previously described TUNEL method (Strater et d., 1995;Gavrieli et d., 1992) for labeling of apoptotic cells.\n\nAs an example, for in situ detection of gene expression, we performed in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-conjugated DNA probe specific for the human CD95Lgene. Bound probes were detected with an immunogold-silver enhancement system. Subsequently, end-labeling of DNA cleaved during the apoptotic process was carried out with biotinylated dUTP, which was finally detected by streptavidin-peroxidase system. Both signals could be clearly discriminated, and nonspecific background staining was negligible. A potentially critical point of this protocol might have been TdT-mediated end-labeling of bound DNA probes producing an additional cytoplasmatic labeling of CD95L \"Aexpressing cells by the streptavidin-peroxidase system. However, this was not observed in our studies. Therefore, either end-labeling of the probe did not occur or labeling was definitely below threshold. We conclude that this new method represents a useful tool for microtopographical analysis of apoptosis-associated gene expression.\n\nby guest on October 27, 2014 jhc.sagepub.com Downloaded from"
