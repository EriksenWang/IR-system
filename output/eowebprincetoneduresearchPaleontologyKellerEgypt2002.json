    "abstract": "During the late Maastrichtian (66.8^65.5 Ma) the Asyut Basin in central Egypt experienced a breakdown of the surface to bottom gradient of the 13 C/ 12 C ratio with planktic N 13 C values 0.2^0.8x lighter than benthic values. Planktic foraminiferal species diversity was reduced by more than 50%, with assemblages dominated (60^90%) by the opportunistic blooms of the disaster species Guembelitria cretacea, which mimic the early Danian. The prolonged breakdown in productivity occurred during a time of tectonic activity and increased terrestrial runoff that may have resulted in highly eutrophic waters, coupled with a sea-level regression (65.5 Ma) that led to restricted circulation. Increased productivity during the short climate warming between 65.4 and 65.2 Ma is associated with increased species diversity, abundant rugoglobigerinids and common heterohelicids. At the end of the Maastrichtian, decreased productivity coincided with the K/T impact and mass extinction, followed by characteristically early Danian low diversity assemblages. The similarity of the late Maastrichtian and post-K/T impact Guembelitria-dominated assemblages reveals that the planktic foraminiferal response to the K/T catastrophe was not unique, but followed a predictable pattern of response to severe environmental perturbations.",
    "full_text": "During the early Maastrichtian a major sea-level transgression established open marine conditions throughout central Egypt, extending a shallow marginal sea to the south and west. Subsequent sea-level regressions caused widespread erosion, particularly in the marginal seas to the south, coupled with local tectonic activity in the Western Desert (Hendriks et al., 1987;Schnack and Luger, 1998;Tantawy et al., 2001). On the stable shelf of the Asyut Basin, erosion was generally more limited, resulting in deposition and preservation of Egypt's most complete sedimentary sequences in the Eastern Desert (e.g. East Qena region, Luger, 1988;Luger et al., 1989;Duwi region, Tantawy, 1998;St. Paul, South Galala, Strougo et al., 1992;Faris, 1984). Among these sedimentary sequences, the Gebel Qreiya section studied for this report is among the very few localities where the planktic foraminiferal zone Parvularugogloberina eugubina is present. During the late Maastrichtian to early Paleocene, Gebel Qreiya was located in the Asyut Basin (Fig. 1 ; Said, 1961Said, , 1962) ) at about middle to outer shelf depths. This region was subject to sea-level £uctuations throughout the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary (Fig. 2; Hendriks et al., 1987;Luger and Groeschke, 1989;Klitzsch and Wycisk, 1987).\n\nThis report focuses on the late Maastrichtian and early Danian of the Gebel Qreiya section in order to: (1) evaluate the completeness of the section using a higher resolution biostratigraphic zonal scheme than has been previously applied, and (2) evaluate the paleoecology of central Egypt based on quantitative faunal analyses of planktic foraminifera and carbon isotopes of monospeci¢c benthic and planktic foraminifera.\n\nThe Gebel Qreiya section is located at the southern end of Wadi Qena, about 50 km northeast of Qena City and 18 km north of Km53 of the Qena^Safaga road (26 ‡21P N, 33 ‡01PE; Fig. 1). The Cretaceous^Tertiary boundary lies within the Dakhla Formation, which is widely distributed in central and southern Egypt, though with variable lithologies (e.g. Said, 1962;Abdel Razik, 1969, 1972;Soliman et al., 1986). The upper Maastrichtian consists of monotonous gray shales containing Pecten farafraensis casts that decrease upsection. At about 1.8 m below the K/T boundary, shales grade into marly shales devoid of macrofossils. About 10 cm below the K/T boundary the marly shales are truncated by an undulating erosional surface, which also truncates burrows (Fig. 2). The 10-cm-thick layer above this erosional surface consists of burrowed marly gray shale with small macrofossils (bivalves, gastropods). This macrofossil-rich layer is truncated by an undulating erosional surface. A thin red layer and thick dark shale overlies this erosional surface and marks the K/T boundary. Above the boundary, basal Danian sediments consist of ¢ssile dark gray shales (50 cm), followed by gray marly shale (V2 m) and gray shale (Fig. 2). Lithological changes, erosional surfaces, truncated burrows, and macrofossil as well as microfossil assemblages indicate that deposition occurred in a shallow marginal sea in£uenced by sea-level changes through the late Maastrichtian and early Danian (Fig. 2).\n\nFor foraminiferal studies samples were processed following the standard method of Keller et al. (1995). Planktic foraminifera are generally abundant and well preserved, except for some intervals of carbonate dissolution. The strongest dissolution is observed in the Danian zone Plc(2) (samples 72^86) where nearly all planktic foraminifera are dissolved. Dissolution e¡ects in the lower part of zone Plc(l) are apparent by the abundance of broken specimens and thin test walls. No dissolution e¡ects are apparent in the late Maastrichtian sediments, though pyrite is present (samples 34^39), suggesting low oxygen conditions.\n\nQuantitative population analysis is based on the s 63-Wm and s 150-Wm size fractions in order to evaluate both small and large species populations. The larger size fraction favors late Cretaceous large tropical and subtropical species, whereas the smaller size fraction favors small Cretaceous species (heterohelicids, guembelitrids, globigerinellids, globotruncanellids) and all early Danian species. (There are no Danian species s 150 Wm and very few are s 100 Wm.) For each sample and each size fraction, about 300 specimens were picked from a representative sample split, mounted on cardboard slides for a permanent record and identi¢ed. Species richness evaluation is based on the presence of the total number of species in each sample from both size fractions, as well as rare species (labeled 'x' in Tables 1^3) detected in a search of the uncounted residue of each sample. Species identi¢cation follows standard taxonomic concepts (Robaszynski et al., 1983^1984;Caron, 1985;Nederbragt, 1991Nederbragt, , 1998;;Olsson et al., 1999). Common planktic foraminiferal species are illustrated in Plates I^VI, and quantitative species census data in Tables 1^3.\n\nStable isotope analyses were conducted on the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides pseudoacutus and the planktic foraminifer Rugoglobigerina rugosa from the size fraction 150^250 Wm. For selected early Danian intervals Guembelitria cretacea, Woodringina hornerstownensis, Subbotina triloculinoides and Globanomalina pentagona were also analyzed. All analyses were conducted at the laboratory of the University of Bern, Switzerland, using a VG Prism II mass spectrometer equipped with a common acid bath. The results are reported relative to the Vienna PeeDee Belemnite standard reference material with a standard error of 0.1x for oxygen and 0.05x for carbon.\n\nThe Gebel Qreiya section of the Asyut Basin is Egypt's most complete late Maastrichtian to early Danian sequence known to date, and also contains relatively well-preserved and abundant planktic foraminifera. To evaluate the nature and continuity of the sedimentary record, the biostratigraphy is evaluated here based on the Cretaceous foraminiferal (CF) zonal scheme by Li and Keller (1998a,b), which replaces the Abathomphalus mayaroensis zone with four zones and hence provides much improved age control for the late Maastrichtian (Fig. 2). Age estimates for the late Maastrichtian biozones are based on foraminiferal datum events of DSDP Site 525 tied to the paleomagnetic stratigraphy of the same core. Age correlations were also made with Tunisian sections based on biostratigraphic correlation and event stratigraphy, including sea-level changes and stable isotope stratigraphy (Li and Keller, 1998c;Li et al., 1999). Ages for these Maastrichtian and Danian datum events and biozones are broadly valid for the eastern Tethys region, including Egypt.\n\nAge estimates for the Danian biozones are from Berggren et al. (1995). Correlation of the foraminiferal zonal scheme of Keller et al. (1995) to that of Berggren et al. (1995) is shown in Fig. 2, though this correlation is tentative due to their reported later ¢rst occurrences of the index species Subbotina triloculinoides and Parasubbotina pseudobulloides. In my experience analyzing various small ( 6 63 Wm, 63^100 Wm) and larger (1001 50 Wm, s 150 Wm) size fractions, the delayed ¢rst occurrences of these species noted by Berggren et al. (1995) correspond to the ¢rst appearances of the larger ( s 100 Wm) morphotypes. In the smaller size fraction ( 6 100 Wm) these species are present earlier, within the upper part of the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina (Pla) zone (Fig. 2).\n\nIn this study, quantitative species analysis as well as ¢rst and last appearances of species are used to obtain biostratigraphic age control. Abrupt changes in assemblage composition may re£ect an incomplete sedimentary record, or rapid environmental changes. The presence of hiatuses can be determined based on biostratigraphy and lithological observations (e.g. erosional surfaces, hardgrounds, concentrations of macrofossils, wood, truncated burrows, increased terrigenous transport).\n\nZone CF3 de¢nes the interval from the ¢rst appearance of Pseudoguembelina hariaensis to the last appearance of Gansserina gansseri (66.83^65.45 Ma) and is equivalent to the upper two thirds of the Micula murus zone. At Gebel Qreiya, the lower 7.5 m of the section analyzed mark zone CF3 as indicated by the co-occurrence of G. gansseri and P. hariaensis. Micula murus is present in this interval and suggests that the lower part of zone CF3, which corresponds to the upper Lithraphidites quadratus zone, was not recovered (Tantawy, in press). Among small planktic foraminifera ( s 63 Wm) zone CF3 is dominated by alternating abundances of Guembelitria cretacea and Heterohelix navarroensis, whereas the larger species group is dominated by Heterohelix globulosa and Laeterohelix labellosa (Figs. 3 and 4; Plate III).\n\nZone CF2 marks the interval from the last appearance of Gansserina gansseri to the ¢rst appearance of Plummerita hantkeninoides and spans about 150 000 years (65.45^65.30 Ma; Fig. 2;  Plate II). At Gebel Qreiya this short zone may be missing or very condensed, as indicated by the juxtaposition of G. gansseri and P. hantkeninoides at 1.8 m below the K/T boundary. Various other species mark a hiatus or condensed interval Fig. 2. Planktic foraminiferal biozonation, datum events and lithology of the Gebel Qreiya section. Lithological changes, undulating erosional surfaces, macrofossils and microfossil assemblages in the Gebel Qreiya section indicate an interrupted sediment record and numerous hiatuses or condensed intervals probably as a result of sea-level £uctuations.

The CF1/CF3 hiatus or condensed interval also marks a lithological change from macrofossil-rich shale to marly shale devoid of macrofossils (Fig. 2), and coincides with the culmination of the Maastrichtian global cooling trend around 65.5 Ma (Barrera, 1994;Li and Keller, 1998a,c;Olsson et al., 2001).\n\nZone CF1 marks the range of Plummerita hantkeninoides which spans the last 300 000 kyr of the Maastrichtian (Pardo et al., 1996;Li and Keller, 1998a,b). At Qreiya P. hantkeninoides ¢rst appears at 1.8 m below the K/T boundary along with Rugoglobigerina reicheli and coincident with the last appearances of Gansserina gansseri and Kassabiana falsocalcarata (Plate I). The juxtaposition of these species suggests a short hiatus or condensed interval that spans zone CF2 and probably the upper part of CF3, as noted above.\n\nIn the uppermost part of zone CF1, two undulating erosional surfaces with truncated burrows mark short hiatuses below the thin red layer that marks the K/T boundary, and about 10 cm below the red clay layer (Fig. 2). This interval may correspond to the global cooling and lower sea-level during the last 100 000 years of the Maastrichtian (Li and Keller (1998c), or the last 22 000 years (Olsson et al. (2001).\n\nBased on faunal changes and comparison with zone CF1 assemblages elsewhere in the Tethys region, only about 1/3 of zone CF1 may be present at Qreiya. For example, zone CF1 spans nearly 6 m in the nearby Wadi Hammama section (Tantawy, in press), 2^8 m in various sections in the Negev (Abramovich et al., 1998), 6 m at El Kef, Tunisia (Li and Keller, 1998b), 9 m at Elles, Tunisia, Abramovich and Keller (2002), and 3.5 m at Agost, Spain (Pardo et al., 1996). However, at least part of the variability in the sediment thickness of zone CF1 in the Negev and southeastern Egypt (Gebel Qreiya and Wadi Hammama) is likely linked to tectonic activity and irregular paleotopography (Hendriks et al., 1987;Hendriks and Luger, 1987;Abramovich et al., 1998).\n\nZone P0 marks the K/T boundary and is de-¢ned as the interval between the extinction of Cretaceous tropical planktic foraminifera and the ¢rst appearance of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina and/or P. longiapertura (Fig. 2 ; Keller et al., 1995). Lithologically, zone P0 is marked by a dark clay layer with a thin red clay at the base. At Qreiya the K/T boundary interval and zone P0 are at least partially preserved as indicated by the presence of a 1-cm-thick red clay layer that overlies an undulating erosional surface. An Ir anomaly of 5.4 ppb was identi¢ed in this red clay layer (sample 11.5 ; Keller et al., in press) Plate I. Globotruncanids, scale bar = 200 Wm.

Throughout Egypt, including the Sinai and Negev, the K/T boundary interval is generally condensed, often highly bioturbated, marked by erosion surfaces and absence of the characteristic K/T boundary clay and basal red layer (Keller and Benjamini, 1991;Shahin, 1992;Samir, 1994;Faris, 1997;Luger et al., 1989;Tantawy et al., 2001).\n\nThis zone is de¢ned by the range of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina and/or P. longiapertura (Fig. 2 ; Plate V). At Qreiya, the ¢rst Tertiary species present at the base of the 50-cm-thick ¢ssile dark gray shale that overlies the red clay of zone P0 (sample 11; Fig. 4) includes, Globoconusa daubjergensis, Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina, P. longiapertura, P. extensa ( = G. conusa), Eoglobigerina edita and E. eobulloides, followed by Subbotina triloculinoides, S. trivialis and Woodringina claytonensis (Plates IV^VI). Few Maastrichtian species are present and most of these are probably reworked (Fig. 4). The top of zone Pla is identi-¢ed by the disappearances of P. eugubina and P. longiapertura at 50 cm (sample 6) above the red clay layer.\n\nThere are several indicators that mark this short Pla zone as incomplete or condensed. Evidence for a basal Danian hiatus includes: (1) the simultaneous ¢rst appearances of six Danian spe-cies, including Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina and P. longiapertura, the index species for zone Pla above the red clay layer (Fig. 4); (2) the relatively low abundance of Guembelitria ( 6 30%), as compared with its characteristic dominance ( s 80%) in basal Danian sediments worldwide (see Keller et al., 1995;Luciani, 1997Luciani, , 2002;;Apellaniz et al., 1997); (3) Subbotina triloculinoides and S. trivialis, which are known to evolve in the upper part of zone Pla already appear 20^30 cm above the red clay; (4) the presence of abundant reworked Maastrichtian species in zone Pla;\n\n(5) the very short interval (50 cm) represented by zone Pla suggests a condensed early Danian, as also observed in the Negev (Keller and Benjamini, 1991); and ( 6) the presence of common Danian species in the larger than 63Wm size fraction; Danian species in the lower part of zone Pla are generally smaller (Keller et al., 2001a). A hiatus or condensed sedimentation in the early Danian zone Pla has been observed in numerous sections and may be related to early Danian cooling and sea-level changes (MacLeod and Keller, 1991;Keller and Stinnesbeck, 1996).\n\nThis zone is de¢ned as the interval between the last occurrence of Parvularugogloberina eugubina and/or P. longiapertura and the ¢rst appearance of Parasubbotina varianta. Zone P1b is condensed partly due to dissolution at the P1b/P1c boundary and a hiatus at the P1a/P1b boundary. Evidence for a P1a/P1b hiatus is indicated by: (1) the abrupt disappearance of P. longiapertura immedi-\n\nPlate II. Rugoglobigerinids, scale bar = 200 Wm.

The condensed upper part of P1b, due to dissolution and/ or a hiatus, is also marked by strong abundance changes in P. extensa, Subbotina triloculinoides, and Woodringina claytonensis (Fig. 4 ; Plates IVV I).\n\nDanian assemblages in the 5-m overlying zone Plb indicate a zone Plc age which is de¢ned as the interval from the ¢rst appearance of Parasubbotina varianta to the ¢rst appearance of Praemurica trinidadensis (Figs. 2 and 4; Plate VI). The latter index species was not observed in the studied interval. Zone Plc can be subdivided into Plc(l) and Plc(2) based on the ¢rst appearance of Praemurica inconstans which ¢rst appears at about 3.8 m above the boundary clay and just below a 1-mthick dissolution interval that contains only rare foraminifera. Relatively impoverished Danian Plc(2) assemblages are present above this dissolution interval (Fig. 4). There are strong and abrupt faunal assemblage and relative abundance changes within Plc(l) that indicate another hiatus at 2.5 m above the boundary clay. Evidence for this hiatus includes: (1) a sharp lithological break from marly shale to shale; (2) the abrupt reap-pearance of abundant Guembelitria cretacea and G. daubjergensis; (3) the abrupt decrease of abundant Woodringina claytonensis, W. hornerstownensis, Globanomalina pentagona and P. varianta (Fig. 4 ; Plates IV and VI).\n\nLate Maastrichtian Tethyan assemblages of middle to outer neritic (100^250 m) and upper bathyal (250^500 m) depths typically have 56^65 species (Keller, 1988(Keller, , 1996;;Keller et al., 1995;Luciani, 1997;Apellaniz et al., 1997;Olsson, 1997;Orue-etxebarria, 1997;Masters, 1997;Abramovich et al., 1998;Abramovich and Keller, 2002). The Qreiya assemblages, deposited in middle to outer neritic depths, di¡er in that species richness is only about half, averaging 25 species in zone CF3 and 30^35 species in CF1 (Fig. 3). Such low species richness is generally only observed in very shallow ( 6 100 m) or restricted Tethyan environments where deeper dwelling species are excluded (e.g. Texas, Alabama, southern Tunisia; Keller, 1989;Olsson and Liu, 1993;Keller et al., 1998Keller et al., , 2002)).\n\nAt Qreiya, the unusually impoverished late Maastrichtian planktic foraminiferal assemblages appear to mimic the post-K/T paleoenvironment (usually interpreted as high stress) in terms of low species diversity and assemblages dominated by ecological generalists and opportunists, particularly in the small size fraction (63^150 Wm). Clues to the nature of this late Maastrichtian low diversity environment can be gained from the presence/ absence of ecological specialists that typically inhabit the Tethys, and the relative abundance variations of the dominant species (ecological generalists and opportunists) and their environmental preferences as observed from paleobiogeographic distribution patterns.\n\nThe species group interpreted as ecological specialists consists of tropical and subtropical species with narrow tolerance limits and restricted geographic range, although they may migrate in small numbers into higher latitudes during climatic warming (Kucera and Malmgren, 1998). Species of this group are generally of large size ( s 150 Wm), complex morphology and highly ornamented, heavily calci¢ed tests with keels, ridges, and spines, and frequently many chambers and large apertures. They include most globotruncanids, racemiguembelinids, planoglobulinids and rugoglobigerinids (Plates I and II).\n\nAt Qreiya, tropical^subtropical ecological specialists are rare or absent, except for rugoglobigerinids (Fig. 3). Globotruncanids, the largest group of ecological specialists is surprisingly rare. Although a total of ten globotruncanid species are recorded, only 4^8 species are present in any given sample, and only Globotruncana esnehensis is consistently present ( 6 1^3%; Table 1). Many common late Maastrichtian globotruncanids are absent, including G. arca, G. orientalis, G. rosetta and R. contusa. The combined relative abundance of globotruncanids is very low, with peaks of 5% and 6% in zone CF3, but only one sample with a maximum of 2% in zone CF1 (Table 1 ; Fig. 5). This is an exceptionally low globotruncanid species richness and abundance for a middle to outer neritic environment of the eastern Tethys. In comparison, 16 globotruncanid species are reported from the Hor Hahar section of the Negev, Israel, with a combined average abundance of 15% in CF3 and 5% in zone CF1 (Abramovich, 1997, Abramovich et al., 1998). At Elles, Tunisia, 18 globotruncanids are reported with a combined abundance of 25^30% in zone CF3 and 5% in CF1 (Abramovich and Keller, 2002). In addition to globotruncanids, many other ecological specialists are also extremely rare or absent at Qreiya, including all gublerinids, racemiguembelinids and planoglobulinids (brazoensis, P. multicamerata, P. averculinoides).\n\nAmong rugoglobigerinids, only Plummerita hantkeninoides, Trinitella scotti and possibly Rugoglobigerina reicheli are largely restricted to the low latitude Tethys. These surface dwellers rarely appear in middle latitudes and are generally absent beyond 30 ‡ north or south (Li and Keller, 1998a;Olsson et al., 2001;MacLeod et al., 2001). Plummerita hantkeninoides evolved near the lower part of the latest Maastrichtian warm event (V65.3 Ma) and disappeared at the K/T boundary (Masters, 1993;Pardo et al., 1996;Li and Keller, 1998c). At Qreiya, P. hantkeninoides is signi¢cantly more abundant (3^14%) than in the Negev (1^4% at Hor Hahar; Abramovich, 1997), Tunisia (1^2% at Elles; Abramovich and Keller, 2002), or Spain (1% at Agost; Pardo et al., 1996). The relatively high abundances of P. hantkeninoides (3^14%) and R. reicheli (1^8% in CF1) contribute to the high abundance of the rugoglobigerinid surface dwellers (40%; Fig. 5) during the warm climate of zone CF1 at Qreiya.

On a global basis, ecological specialists su¡ered severely during the late Maastrichtian cooling and all went extinct at or near the K/T boundary (Keller, 1988(Keller, , 1996;;Masters, 1997;Orue-etxebarria, 1997;Olsson, 1997;Luciani, 1997;Abramovich et al., 1998). No species of this group dominated planktic foraminiferal assemblages at any time during the late Maastrichtian (Keller, 1988;1996;Malmgren, 1991;Luciani, 1997;Nederbragt, 1998;Li and Keller, 1998a,b). However, in central Egypt unique environmental conditions severely limisted species diversity. This is indicated by the very low species richness of the Qreiya assemblages, which is primarily due to the absence or rarity of the largely subsurface dwelling ecological specialists, including globotruncanids, gublerinids and planoglobulinids. In contrast, rugoglobigerinid surface dwellers thrived (V40%), at least during the warm event of zone CF1 (Fig. 5). This suggests peculiarities in the watermass strati¢cation (e.g. expanded oxygen minimum zone, low productivity, absence of thermal strati¢cation) possibly as a result of restricted circulation in central Egypt.\n\nEcological migrants are loosely de¢ned here as a group of species that thrived in warm tropical and subtropical waters and migrated into middle and higher latitudes during times of climate warming. They are thus di¡erentiated from ecological specialists by common or consistent presence in middle latitudes and hence greater environmental tolerance outside the Tethys. This group includes mostly surface dwellers (rugoglobigerinids, pseudotextularids, pseudoguembelinids ; Plates II and III) and, except for rugoglobigerinids, none show major abundance variations and they are therefore not discussed further.\n\nHeterohelicids are here interpreted as ecological generalists. They are the garden weeds of the foraminiferal community. These biserial taxa are characterized by medium or small test sizes, simple morphologies, little surface ornamentation (Plates III and IV), and nearly global biogeographic range. They appear to have tolerated sig-ni¢cant £uctuations in temperature and/or salinity, oxygen and nutrients and can therefore be considered ecological generalists. In particular, the isotopic compositions of smaller species (Heterohelix globulosa, H. dentata, Laeterohelix labellosa, H. planata and H. navarroensis, Plate III) suggest that they lived in deeper less oxygenated waters, and may have thrived at times of expanded oxygen minimum zones (Boersma and Premoli Silva, 1989;Barrera and Keller, 1994;MacLeod et al., 2001), whereas their global biogeographic distribution suggests a tolerance for temperature changes (Nederbragt, 1998). Heterohelix globulosa, the most abundant of these species, tends to exhibit a preference for continental margins (Leckie, 1987;Keller, 1989Keller, , 1996;;Malmgren, 1991).\n\nAt Qreiya, heterohelicids dominate (50^70%; Fig. 5) in the s 150-Wm size fraction, with Hete-Plate V.

Laeterohelix labellosa is more common in CF3, and H. punctulata, H. planata and H. dentata in CF1 (Fig. 3). In the smaller size fraction (63^150 Wm) heterohelicids are less abundant, except for a short interval in zone CF3 where H. navarroensis dominates, and H. globulosa and H. dentata increase in zone CF1 (Fig. 5). Late Maastrichtian heterohelicid dominance has also been observed in Tunisia, Israel, Italy, Spain, Texas, Denmark and DSDP Site 525 (Keller, 1988(Keller, , 1989;;Nederbragt, 1991Nederbragt, , 1998;;Malmgren, 1991;Keller et al., 1995Keller et al., , 1993;;Luciani, 1997;Abramovich et al., 1998;Li and Keller, 1998a;Abramovich and Keller, 2002). Dominance of ecological generalists at Qreiya in central Egypt suggests decreased water mass strati¢cation and may re£ect an expanded oxygen minimum zone. Higher relative abundances of Heterohelix navarroensis in CF3 and of H. dentata and H. planata in CF1 suggest changing water mass characteristics, though speci¢c habitats and ecological requirements of particular heterohelicid species are still largely unknown.\n\nThe most unusual aspect of the late Maastrichtian faunal assemblages at Qreiya is the dominance of Guembelitria cretacea ( s 63-Wm size fraction; Fig. 4 ; Plate 4). This species has been observed to dominate after the K/T boundary impact event in the early Danian zones P0 and lower Pla, and has therefore been labeled ecological opportunist or disaster species. Guembelitria cretacea is generally present in very low frequencies ( 6 1%) in late Maastrichtian faunal assemblages of normal open marine environments, but more abundant (10^20%) in shallow nearshore environments, such as those of Brazos, Texas (Keller, 1989), Denmark (Schmitz et al., 1992;Keller et al., 1993), or southern Tunisia (Keller et al., 1998). However, at times of low species diversity and reduced species abundances Guembelitria species tend to produce opportunistic blooms, as is well known for the K/T boundary clay and early Danian. In the Negev, Abramovich et al. (1998) noticed three Guembelitria cretacea blooms in the late Maastrichtian. But no such high abundances of G. cretacea as at Qreiya (60^90%) have been observed before. However, recently a larger, elongate and high-spired new species, Guembelitria dammula, was observed with the same high abundances in zone CF1 from sections along the coast of the Black Sea (Bjala, Bulgaria; Adatte et al., 2002b).\n\nHigh abundances of the ecological opportunist Guembelitria characterize crisis conditions at the K/T boundary as well as the anoxic event near the Cenomanian/Turonian transition (e.g. Leckie, 1987;Apellaniz et al., 1997;Luciani, 1997;Keller et al., 2001bKeller et al., , 2002)). The persistent relatively high abundances of this species group in shallow nearshore areas during the late Maastrichtian suggest a high tolerance for salinity, nutrient and temperature £uctuations. In the Gafsa Basin (Seldja) of southern Tunisia, Guembelitria dominance is associated with a warm humid climate, high rainfall, low salinity, high organic matter in£ux from near-Fig. 3. Planktic foraminiferal species abundances in the s 150-Wm size fraction of the late Maastrichtian at Gebel Qreiya, Egypt. Note that the late Maastrichtian is dominated by low oxygen tolerant small heterohelicid species (H. globulosa, H. labellosa, H. dentata, H. planata, H. punctulata). Rugoglobigerinids increased in relative abundances during the last 300 000 kyr of the Maastrichtian (R. rugosa, R. macrocephala, R. reicheli, Plummerita hantkeninoides). Dashed lines mark hiatuses. Zone CF2 appears to be missing (65.45^65.3 Ma), zone CF1 is only partially present, the earliest Danian zone P0 is restricted to the red layer, and the lower part of zone Pla is missing.

Planktic foraminiferal species abundances in the smaller (63^150 Wm) size fraction of the late Maastrichtian to early Paleocene at Gebel Qreiya, Egypt. Note the unusually high abundance of Guembelitria cretacea in the late Maastrichtian, and the alternation of abundant Guembelitria with abundant small heterohelicids (e.g.H. navarroensis, H. globulosa, H. dentata). This pattern is unknown from late Maastrichtian sequences, and similarly high abundances of Guembelitria are only recorded from the post-K/T boundary intervals of zones P0 and Pla. The absence of high Guembelitria immediately after the K/T boundary is due to a hiatus that removed P0 and the lower part of Pla. Calcareous nannofossil zones from Tantawy, in press. G. Keller / Marine Micropaleontology 47 (2002) 71^99\n\nby terrestrial areas and hence eutrophic waters, and low oxygen bottom water conditions (Keller et al., 1998). In the same area, the ecological generalist Heterohelix navarroensis thrived at times of low Guembelitria abundances. The same pattern is observed at Qreiya (Fig. 5), which suggests that similar environmental conditions prevailed in the deeper water central Egypt basin during the late Maastrichtian. At Qreiya, carbon isotopes provide further clues to the environmental conditions in which Guembelitria thrived.\n\nForaminifera are well preserved at Qreiya. However, even well preserved tests tend to be partially recrystallized with up to 50% diagenetic calcite (Pearson et al. (2001). Recrystallization of foraminiferal tests occurs upon settling in the cool waters of the ocean £oor. As a result, oxygen isotopic trends shift towards more positive (cooler) values and carbon isotopes towards more negative values (lower productivity). Isotopic values are thus biased towards cooler temperatures and lower productivity. However, carbon isotope differentials between species tend to be retained during diagenesis, but with the e¡ect of reducing the di¡erential depending on the degree of diagenesis. Thus, in completely recrystallized tests, N 13 C values of benthic and planktic species converge (Pearson et al., 2001). At Qreiya the carbon isotope di¡erential between benthic and planktic species shows distinct trends that indicate changes in productivity, as is also suggested by correlative changes in species populations and faunal assemblages.\n\nThe late Maastrichtian surface-to-deep N 13 C gradient of the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides pseudoacutus and planktic foraminifer Rugoglobigerina rugosa at Qreiya is very unusual. Benthic N 13 C values show relatively minor variations between 0x and 30.3x, though there are major excursions in planktic N 13 C values (Fig. 5). Near the base of the section, a small positive surface-todeep N 13 C gradient is present. This is followed by a negative planktic N 13 C excursion of 0.5^0.8x and establishes an inverse surface-to-deep gra-dient for the remainder of zone CF3 and into the base of CF1 (Fig. 5 ; Table 3). A positive shift of 0.8x in planktic N 13 C values reestablishes a slightly positive surface-to-deep gradient in zone CF1. Near the top of the Maastrichtian (top 20 cm), planktic N 13 C values drop by 0.6x and are again more negative than benthic values, as is characteristic of the K/T boundary in general.\n\nIs the observed reversal in the surface-to-deep gradient real or an artifact of diagenesis ? Recrystallization of foraminiferal tests occurs in the cooler waters of the ocean £oor, which shifts planktics towards more negative carbon values than benthic species, and hence reduces the surface-to-deep gradient. Total (100%) recrystallization would result in convergence of planktic and benthic values (Pearson et al., 2001). Thus, recrystallization alone cannot account for the more negative planktic values during the late Maastrichtian at Qreiya, and strongly suggests that surface productivity was very low. The unusual low diversity Guembelitria-dominated planktic foraminiferal assemblages support this interpretation.\n\nBenthic N 13 C values show only a minor decrease (30.3x) across the K/T boundary, consistent with benthic patterns elsewhere (Keller and Lindinger, 1989;Zachos et al., 1989). However, in the early Danian Pla^Plb interval benthic values continued to drop and reached minimum values at the Pla/Plb hiatus (Fig. 5). The ¢rst recovery is indicated at the P1b/Plc boundary and hiatus by a brief positive excursion, followed by another negative excursion in the lower part of Plc(l). Similar positive and negative excursions were observed at these time intervals in the Negev (Magaritz et al., 1992) and South Atlantic (Barrera and Keller, 1994).\n\nIt is di⁄cult to evaluate the surface-to-deep N 13 C gradient of the early Danian because planktic foraminiferal species are extremely small, short ranging, and often present in insu⁄cient quantities for analysis. In addition, diagenetic effects due to partial recrystallization and possibly test in¢llings may have obliterated original signals in these small species. At Gebel Qreiya, a number of planktic species were analyzed with mixed results that suggest diagenetic overprints and possibly species e¡ects. Guembelitria cretacea, Wood-rigina hornerstownensis, and Globigerina pentagona have generally lighter, or similar values as the benthic species Cibicidoides pseudoacutus. Only Subbotina tiloculinoides from samples in the upper part of zone Plc has N 13 C values that are generally heavier (¢ve out of seven samples) than the benthic species (Fig. 5). These data re£ect the dif-¢culties of determining surface-to-deep gradient changes in the early Danian and demonstrate the need for further analysis of well-preserved Danian assemblages.\n\nThe Cretaceous^Tertiary boundary impact horizon is characterized by the mass extinction of tropical and subtropical planktic foraminiferal species, followed by opportunistic blooms of Guembelitria cretacea (e.g. Luciani, 1997;Masters, 1997;Olsson, 1997, Orue-extebarria, 1997;Keller, 1996Keller, , 2001)). At least some of the early Danian species are interpreted to have repopulated the world oceans from the high latitudes, which served as refuge for ecological generalists (MacLeod and Keller, 1994). This pattern has been considered unique to the K/T boundary as a result of the biological devastation of the impact event.\n\nNew data from late Maastrichtian planktic foraminiferal assemblages at Qreiya in central Egypt challenge these interpretations. The Qreiya section shows that both the opportunist Guembelitria cretacea and the small ecological generalists (Heterohelix) lived, and at times thrived in the tropics, as also observed in southern Tunisia and Brazos River, Texas (Keller, 1989;Keller et al., 1998Keller et al., , 2002)). Ecological opportunists and generalists thus appear to have been an integral part of planktic foraminiferal assemblages in the tropics, and indeed across latitudes, during the late Cretaceous. But they remained a minor, though sometimes invisible, part of the planktic foraminiferal assemblages in normally productive and well-strati¢ed oceans, because of their low abundances ( 6 1%) and very small size (36^100 Wm) within assemblages of generally large ecological specialist species ( s 150 Wm). At times of ecological stress, here interpreted as low productivity, oligotrophic or eutrophic environments, ecological specialists disappeared, and ecological generalists and opportunists thrived.\n\nThe environmental conditions in which Guembelitria thrived are still speculative. From post-K/T boundary Guembelitria blooms in sections around the world we know that these blooms occurred in shallow and deepwater environments, near shores and in the open ocean, at high and low latitudes. Guembelitria blooms are therefore not speci¢c to temperature, water depths, or salinity, but seem to occur during times of low productivity, eutrophic waters, and disruption of normal water mass strati¢cation. For example, the post-K/T Guembelitria blooms are invariably associated with a productivity crash as indicated by the drop in surface N 13 C to below benthic values (Zachos et al., 1989), but nutrient-rich eutrophic conditions as indicated by the high total organic contents.\n\nSimilarly, the late Maastrichtian (zones CF3Ĉ F1, 66.8^65.4 Ma; Fig. 5) Guembelitria blooms at Qreiya are associated with a major breakdown in primary productivity, as well as the near absence of tropical ecological specialists. The highest Guembelitria abundances are associated with the lowest planktic N 13 C values indicating their surface habitat, whereas low abundances are associated with increased N 13 C, peak abundances of the biserial Heterohelix navarroensis in CF3, and several small biserial species in CF1 (H. navarroensis, H. dentata, H. planata, H. globulosa), as well as an increase in rugoglobigerinids (Fig. 5). All of these species are subsurface dwellers living above the thermocline. Carbon isotopes thus suggest that the main factor controlling the impoverished late Maastrichtian planktic assemblages in central Egypt is low primary productivity.\n\nThe paleoecology of the triserial Guembelitria cretacea is still poorly understood. Kroon and Nederbragt (1990) suggested that it is an upwelling species, based on a triserial species that lives in upwelling areas of the Indian Ocean today. However, no upwelling areas have been associated with late Maastrichtian, or early Tertiary, Guembelitria blooms to date. In central Egypt, these blooms occurred in a basin with restricted circu-lation, and in southern Tunisia, they occurred in a very shallow marginal environment with salinity and nutrient £uctuations (Keller et al., 1998;Adatte et al., 2002a).\n\nGuembelitria species appear to have been surface dwellers, as is suggested by their consistently common occurrences in shallow waters (e.g. Texas, Alabama, Denmark, Tunisia; Keller, 1989;Olsson and Liu, 1993, Keller et al., 1993, 1998, 2002), small size, very light carbon isotopic values, and near absence in normally strati¢ed deeper water environments. However, Guembelitria blooms are present in shallow and deepwater post-K/T environments that are characterized by eutrophic conditions (high total organic carbon), but low productivity. This association with low productivity may re£ect: (a) higher tolerance for environmental stress and particularly eutrophic environments; (b) reduced habitat competition following the disappearance of ecological specialists ; (c) the advantage of small size and surface dwelling habitat; or (d) a combination of reduced competition and eutrophication favoring small surface dwelling species. The generally inverse relationship with heterohelicid abundances may be related to variations in productivity, oxygen content of waters, and niche competition. At least some Cretaceous heterohelicids (e.g. Heterohelix globulosa, H. navarroensis, H. dentata), as well as early Danian biserial species (e.g. Woodringina Fig. 6. Summary of paleoenvironmental proxies at Qreiya, Egypt. Note that species richness during the late Maastrichtian is only about half that of normal marine environments, probably as a result of the very low productivity similar to the post-K/T environment. Low productivity in the late Maastrichtian in southern Egypt is associated with tectonic activity, increased runo¡ of terrigenous detritus including organic matter, a lower sea-level, and probably a restricted basin, eutrophic waters and disrupted thermohaline circulation. hornerstownensis, W. claytonensis) appear to have been low oxygen tolerant (Boersma and Premoli Silva, 1989;Barrera and Keller, 1994). Although current data strongly suggest that Guembelitria blooms are associated with highly eutrophic, but low productivity environments, whether in shallow or deeper waters, further studies of their occurrences in late Maastrichtian sediments are needed to conclusively determine their ecological associations.\n\nDuring the late Maastrichtian zone CF3 (66.86 5.5 Ma) central Egypt experienced the critical high stress conditions that are usually associated with the K/T boundary impact event. Surface productivity dropped resulting in an inverse surfaceto-deep gradient, species diversity dropped to less than half of normal Tethyan assemblages, and the opportunistic species Guembelitria-dominated (60^90%), though alternating with low oxygen tolerant heterohelicids (H. navarroensis, H. dentata, H. globulosa ; Figs. 5 and 6). The conditions that created this high stress environment are likely related to local tectonic activity coupled with climate, productivity and sea-level £uctuations. Sediment deposition occurred in middle to outer neritic (100^250 m) environments, interrupted by erosion due to sea-level regressions (Fig. 6). However, similar paleodepth environments in Texas, Tunisia, Israel and the Sinai retained more normal species diversity and Guembelitria species are rare or absent, except in two short intervals in the Negev which are marked by syntectonic activity (Almogi-Labin et al., 1990;Abramovich et al., 1998).\n\nIn central Egypt, local tectonic conditions coupled with a low sea-level may have temporarily isolated this region and disrupted normal thermohaline circulation. In the south of Egypt, the late Maastrichtian (zone CF3; Fig. 6) coincided with the onset of tectonic activity (Soliman et al., 1986;Hendriks et al., 1987;Hendriks and Luger, 1987;Smith et al., 1994;Schnack and Luger, 1998). The development of uplifted areas may have created a semi-restricted basin with sluggish circulation, whereas the increased terrigenous runo¡ supplied high organic matter leading to eutrophic waters. This may have resulted in decreased surface productivity and low species diversity that favored low oxygen tolerant heterohelicids and ecological opportunists. The similarity of these late Maastrichtian assemblages with post-K/T impact assemblages reveals that the planktic foraminiferal response to the K/T catastrophe was not unique, but followed a predictable pattern of response to a speci¢c set of environmental conditions that may or may not be related to impact events.\n\nG.
