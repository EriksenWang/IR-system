    "abstract": "Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) was purified to near homogeneity from isolated megagametophytes of germinated loblolly pine (Pinus faeda 1.) seeds, and monospecific antibodies were elicited in rabbits. Following a procedure that involved acetone extraction, (NH&S04 fractionation, and four chromatographic steps (i.e. DE-52 cellulose, Superdex-200, hydroxylapatite, and phenyl-bepharose CL-4B), catalase was purified about 140-fold to a final specific activity of 2215 mmol min-' mg-' of protein. Cotton isocitrate lyase antibodies were used, and protein immunoblots revealed that the resolution on hydroxylapatite and phenyl-Sepharose allowed for the complete separation of catalase from contaminating isocitrate lyase. l h e molecular masses of the native enzyme and its subunit are 235 and 59 kD, respectively, indicating that the pine holoenzyme is a homotetramer. Loblolly pine catalase exists as multiple isoforms. When megagametophytes taken 7 d after imbibition at 30°C were extracted, subjected to nondenaturing isoelectric focusing, and stained for catalase activity, at least four catalase isoforms were observed, including one dominant form with an isoelectric point of 6.87. Purified pine catalase is not a glycoprotein and has a ratio of absorbance at 208 nm to absorbance at 405 nm of 1.5. When probed with loblolly pine catalase antibodies, protein blots of cell-free extracts from megagametophytes of mature, stratified, and germinated loblolly pine seeds, the megagametophyte glyoxysomal fraction, and purified loblolly pine catalase all revealed one immunoreactive 59-kD polypeptide. This indicates that no detectable change in the enzyme's monomeric molecular mass occurs during seed stratification and germination, early seedling growth, and purification.",
    "full_text": "Following the completion of germination, oil seeds such as loblolly pine begin to mobilize lipid reserves via the poxidation of fatty acids. The subsequent conversion of acetyl-COA to malate (via the glyoxylate cycle) provides the substrate for carbohydrates that will serve as the primary energy source of the developing young seedling (Beevers, 1979;Huang et al., 1983). Many of the enzymes involved in early seedling metabolism have been studied extensively. In particular, CAT and glyoxylate cycle enzymes such as MS and ICL have a11 been shown to be highly regulated, undergoing dramatic increases in activity following seed germination and then subsequent declines as lipid reserves are depleted and photosynthetic independence is attained (Beevers, 1979;Huang et al., 1983). Although these enzymes are well char- acterized in a number of angiosperm systems, an understanding of their developmental regulation in gymnosperms is limited. To date, studies of glyoxylate cycle enzymes and the mobilization of lipid reserves in gymnosperms have been restricted to assessing changes in enzyme activity and quantifying lipid breakdown during and following germination (Ching, 1972;Noland and Murphy, 1984;Pite1 and Cheliak, 1986;Groome et al., 1991). In hopes of elucidating some of the developmental controls of gene expression following seed germination and providing some much-needed basic information concerning these processes in gymnosperms, we have begun to examine a number of key enzymes involved in reserve storage mobilization in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), including CAT.\n\nCAT (H202:H202 oxidoreductase, EC 1.1 1.1.6) has been purified and characterized from various bacterial, fungal, and animal sources (Schonbaum and Chance, 1976) and from a number of angiosperms, e.g. spinach Ieaves (Galston et al., 1951), cucumber cotyledons (Lamb et al., 1978), maize scuttela (Chandlee et al., 1983), pumpkin cotyledons (Yamaguchi et al., 1986), sunflower cotyledons (Eising and Gerhardt, 1986), cotton cotyledons (Kunce et al., 1988), tobacco leaves (Havir and McHale, 1990), and castor bean endosperm (Ota et al., 1992). However, to our knowledge, the enzyme has never been purified from any gymnosperm source. CAT has been consistently characterized as a heme-containing, tetrameric enzyme that is exclusively localized in microbodies (e.g. glyoxysomes and leaf peroxisomes). In glyoxysomes, CAT catalyzes the decomposition of H202 produced from the p-oxidation of fatty acids (Beevers, 1979;Huang et al., 1983).\n\nCAT has been reported to exist in multiple forms in many higher plants, e.g. spinach (Galston, 1955), mustard (Drumm and Shopfer, 1974), wheat (Singh and Singh, 1975), cotton (Kunce and Trelease, 1986), sunflower (Eising and Gerhardt, 1986), maize (Scandalios, 1987), tobacco (Havir and McHale, 1989), and castor bean (Ota et al., 1992). However, only in cotton and maize have the biochemical and molecular aspects of CAT multiplicity been studied thoroughly (Scandalios, 1987;Ni and Trelease, 1991).\n\nIn hopes of understanding the mechanism of the multiplicity of the CAT isoform family in a gymnosperm, we have purified and characterized the enzyme from genninated loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) megagametophytes. Using a variety of chromatographic techniques, we have separated CAT from Plant Physiol. Vol. 103, 1993 MS and ICL, both of which have been shown to be frequently contaminated by CAT in the final preparations of these enzymes from other plant sources (Servettaz et al., 1973;Koller and Kindl, 1977;Frevert and Kindl, 1978;Lamb et al., 1978;Pinzauti et al., 1986). On the basis of protein immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies raised against purified CAT show monospecificity to a11 forms of the enzyme in loblolly pine megagametophytes, including those from mature, stratified, and germinated seeds, as well as isolated glyoxysomal preparations.\n\nLoblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seeds were kindly provided by Westvaco (Summerville, SC). Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl), white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzieseii [Mirb] Franco) seeds were a11 obtained from the Pine Ridge Forest Nursery (Smokey Lake, Alberta, Canada). A11 seeds were sterilized as previously described (Groome et al., 1991), with the exception that H202 was omitted. The seeds were then allowed to imbibe on sterile moist Kimpak (Seedboro Equipment, Chicago, IL) at 2OC in the dark for at least 30 d to overcome dormancy. After chilling, the nondormant stratified seeds were surface sterilized in 1% (v/v) NaOCl for 5 min and then transferred to autoclaved Kimpak-lined germination trays. The trays were then placed in a germinator, continuously illuminated at 19 pmol m-' s-' and 3OoC (Controlled Environments, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) for up to 10 d, and megagametophytes and developing seedlings were isolated as previously described (Groome et al., 1991). Castor bean (Ricinus communis L. cv Hale) seeds were obtained commercially from Bothwell Enterprises (Plainview, TX), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Deltapine 62) seeds were kindly provided by Dr. R.N. Trelease (Department of Botany and Microbiology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ).\n\nCAT activity was assayed by the method of Lück (1963). The first-order decomposition of H202 was measured at 240 nm, and controls contained no H202. One unit of CAT activity (kunit) was defined as that amount of enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of 1 mmol of H202 min-' at 22OC. ICL activity was assayed according to the method of Lamb et al. (1978). The formation of glyoxylate phenylhydrazone was monitored as the change in A324 using controls containing no isocitric acid. One unit of ICL activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 pmol of D,L-isocitrate to glyoxylate and succinate per min at 22OC. MS activity was assayed as described by Cooper and Beevers (1969). MS activity was monitored as a change in A412, and controls contained no sodium glyoxylate. One unit of MS activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 nmol of COA min-' at 22OC. A11 protein extractions for SDS-PAGE were camed out by homogenization in a cold mortar with 50 m~ NaP04, pH 7.5, containing 10 m~ DTT and 0.1 mM leupeptin. Protein quantification was by the method of Lowry et al. (1951), with BSA as a standard. The protein concentration of column effluents was monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm.\n\nA11 procedures were carried out at 4OC. A11 buffers 1:ontained 10 m DTT and 1 p~ leupeptin and were deaerated overnight before use. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl; buffer C, 200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0); buffer D, 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0), 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol.\n\nIsolated frozen megagametophytes (20 g) were grounmd to a powder in a cold mortar with liquid nitrogen and reextracted with cold acetone (-20OC). The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,OOOg for 20 min, and the resulting precipitate was resuspended in buffer A. After the suspension was homogenized in a Brinkman Polytron blender at high speed, the slurry was filtered through Miracloth and centrifugecl at 25,0008 for 30 min. The supematant fluid was then fractionated at 4OC by the slow addition of solid (NH4)2S04. Proteins precipitating in the 30 to 70% saturation fraction were resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against three changes of the same buffer. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,OOOg for 10 min, and the dialyzed sample was applied to a Whatman DE-52 cellulose column (1.5 x 25 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. After the column was washed with five column volumes of the same buffer, a 100-mL linear gradient of NaCl (0.0-0.2!3 M in buffer A) was applied at a flow rate of 30 mL h-'. P'eak CAT-activity fractions were pooled and concentrated by (NH&S04 precipitation at 4OC (80% saturation). The precipitate was resuspended in 2.5 mL of buffer B and applied directly to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (3 mL min-'; Pharmacia fast-protein liquid chromatography system) that had been equilibrated in buffer B. Peak CAT-activity fractions were pooled and precipitated with (NH&S04 at 4OC (811% saturation), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1.2 mL of buffer A. The sample was dialyzed ovemight against three changes of buffer A, centrifuged, and loaded directly onto a Bio-Gel HTP column (1 X 12 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A and then eluted with a 100-mL linear gradient of 0.01 to 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 20 mL h-'. Peak CAT-activity fractions were pooled and concentrated by (NH4)2S04 at 4OC (100% saturation). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1.5 mL of buffer C and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (1 X 15 cm; Sigma Chemical Co.) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After the columns were washed with 4 column volumes of buffer C, CAT was eluted with a 100-mL reverse linear gradient (20 mL h-') consisting of 0.2 to O M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and O to 100% (v/v) ethylene glycol as described by Kunce et al. (1988). Peak CAT-activity fractions were pooled, concentrated to 0.5 mL against buffer D using Centricon-30 Microconcentrators according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amicon Corp.), and stored at -7OOC.\n\nPolyclonal antibodies to CAT were elicited by injecting 30 pg of purified enzyme in 0.75 mL of PBS and 0.75 mL of Freunds complete adjuvant subscapularly and submuscularly at multiple sites of female Flemish giant French lop rabbits. Two separate booster injections were administered every 28 d according to the same injection routes as the initial injections, except 20 pg of CAT protein in 0.75 mL of PBS and 0.75 mL of Freunds incomplete adjuvant was used. Rabbits were bled 8 to 10 d after every booster injection to test for titer. Blood was drawn, incubated at 37OC for 2 h and then 4OC overnight, and centrifuged in a clinical swinging bucket rotor, and the serum was stored at -7OOC.\n\nSample preparation and SDS-PAGE were carried out as described by Laemmli (1970) using a Mini Gel System (Bio-Rad) with a 0.75-mm 12% slab gel at 200 V. Following electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by either Coomassie blue R as described by Burk et al. (1983) or silver stained with a Bio-Rad silver stain kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad). The molecular masses of the proteins were determined by the method of Weber and Osbome (1969). Molecular mass markers included: phosphorylase b, 97.4 kD; BSA, 66.2 kD; ovalbumin, 45 kD; carbonic anhydrase, 31 kD; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 21.5 kD; and lysozyme, 14.4 kD (Bio-Rad).\n\nNondenaturing IEF was carried out on a Multiphor I1 horizontal electrophoresis system (Pharmacia LKB). Gels were cast using a Mini Casting Tray (Bio-Rad) and consisted of 5% polyacrylamide (24.25:0.75 [w/v], acry1amide:bis-acrylamide), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) Pharmalyte (pH 5-8). Both the cathodic (20 mM NaOH) and anodic (50 m~ acetic acid) solutions were freshly prepared and thoroughly deaerated before use. Samples for IEF were prepared according to the procedures described by Kunce and Trelease (1986) with modifications. Twelve isolated megagametophytes (0.15 g), frozen in liquid nitrogen, were ground to a powder in a cold mortar. Samples were then extracted by continuing grinding in 0.25 mL of 100 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.0), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM leupeptin, and 20 m~ DTT. After centrifugation at 14,OOOg for 20 min, the supematant cell-free extracts were then diluted in extraction buffer to contain equal amounts of CAT activity. Samples were further diluted (l:l, v/v) with a solution of 80% (v/v) glycerol and 4% (v/v) Pharmalytes (pH 5-8). Electrophoresis was performed at 4OC and 500 V for 15 min, followed by 750 V for 2 h. After focusing, gels were negatively stained for CAT activity using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as described by Clare et al. (1984) and photographed. In this paper, CAT isoforms are presented as positive images obtained by contact printing using the original gel as a negative. This results in improved visual resolution provided by dark bands on a light background. A Multiphor surface electrode (Pharmacia LKB) was used to determine the pIs of the CAT isoforms.\n\nGlyoxysomes were prepared from loblolly megagametophytes by differential centrifugation according to the procedure described by Maeshima and Beevers (1985). Glyoxysomes were broken osmotically by diluting with 2 volumes of 1 M KC1/1 m~ EDTA and were identified by assaying for ICL and MS activity as marker enzymes. Selected glyoxysomal fractions containing peak CAT activity were pooled and prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis as previously described.\n\nFollowing SDS-PAGE, gels were equilibrated for 20 min in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM Gly and 20% [v/v] methanol). The subsequent transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) was camed out ovemight in a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The nitrocellulose blots were then stained according to the procedures described by Kunce and Trelease (1986). Immunoreactive polypeptides were visualized using alkaline phosphatase activity following the supplier's instructions (Bio-Rad). Immunotitration was carried out as described by Trelease et al. (1987), except samples were prepared in 50 m~ NaP04 (pH 7.5), and 0.10 m~ leupeptin.\n\nThe purification procedure for CAT from isolated loblolly pine megagametophytes (7 DAI) is summarized in Table I and Figure 1. Although consisting of six main steps, including four chromatographic separations, the procedure was camed out in less than 2 d. Following (NH4)2S04 fractionation and  Table I) were subjected to SDS-PACE on 12% gels and visualized by Coomassie blue staining (A-F). A, Acetone extract (crude homogenate); B, 30 to 70% saturation (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 fraction; C, pooled active fractions from DE-52 cellulose; D, pooled fractions from gel filtration on Superdex-200; E, pooled high CAT/low ICL activity fractions from HTP; F, pooled purified CAT fractions from phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B. C, Silver-stained pooled purified CAT (59 kD) fractions from phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B. Protein (15 ^g) was applied to each lane, except in lanes F and G where 5 ^g was loaded. The arrow indicates the relative mobility of CAT (59 kD). Numerical values to the right of the gel are molecular masses (in kD) of protein standards.\n\nchromatography on DE-52 cellulose and Superdex-200, initial CAT preparations consistently revealed two dominant protein bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane D). Because of numerous reports identifying CAT as a frequent contaminant of ICL and MS preparations from many higher plants (Servettaz et al., 1973;Koller and Kindl, 1977;Frevert and Kindl, 1978;Lamb et al., 1978;Pinzauri et al., 1986), we examined both enzymes throughout our CAT purification procedure. Despite very low activity due to suboptimal extraction conditions, MS co-purified with CAT during the first four steps of the purification. MS was then completely removed from CAT on HTP, with the former not binding to the matrix and eluting off with the flow-through (data not shown). At this stage, cotton CAT and ICL antibodies identified loblolly pine CAT as a 59-kD protein and ICL as a 64-kD contaminant (data not shown). Having completely removed MS, HTP chromatography also provided the first step at which CAT could be partially resolved from ICL (Fig. 1, lane E). Because just those fractions containing high CAT activity and low ICL activity were collected, only a 12% overall yield after HTP was achieved. However, this step still resulted in a substantial increase in CAT specific activity, purifying the protein about 2.6-fold (Table I). Despite varying numerous chromatographic conditions, including elution gradients and flow rate, all attempts to separate the enzymes further using HTP chromatography were unsuccessful. In relation to this, Lamb et al. (1978) reported that cucumber CAT and ICL appeared quite similar in chemical and physical properties.\n\nThe final separation of loblolly pine CAT from ICL was accomplished by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Fig. 1, lane F). The ability of a hydrophobic matrix to effectively resolve both enzymes has been demonstrated before (Pinzauti et al., 1986). Similar to those findings, and in agreement with ICL's reportedly high hydrophobicity (Vanni et al., 1990), loblolly pine CAT did not bind as strongly to phenyl-Sepharose as did ICL, resulting in their complete resolution. CAT activity eluted from the column at approximately 45% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.11 M potassium phosphate, and those active fractions with no detectable ICL activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafilrration, and stored for antibody production. The final specific activity of the purified CAT preparation was about 2215 kunits mg~', representing an overall purification of about 140-fold (Table I). Although somewhat higher than most of the published values for the enzyme isolated to date, the final specific activity of loblolly pine CAT may be due simply to the relatively rapid, 2-d purification procedure and/or species-specific stability and high activity of the enzyme. Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE of purified CAT revealed a single band of about 59 kD (Fig. 1, lane F), and only when silver stained could a small number of contaminating proteins be observed (Fig. 1, lane G). To ascertain further the purity of the final CAT preparation, no ICL enzyme activity (data not shown) or protein, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with cotton ICL antibodies (Fig. 2, lane C), was detectable. Results presented in this paper and studies of castor bean (Mullen and Gifford, 1991) indicate that ICL and CAT copurify through nearly all chromatographic and fractionation techniques used. Consequently, there is the need for precautions when assessing the final purity of CAT preparations from higher plant sources.\n\nAs determined from its mobility during 7 and 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane F), the subunit molecular mass of purified CAT is approximately 59 kD. The native molecular mass of loblolly pine CAT, as estimated by gel filtration on a calibrated Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma) is 235 kD, indicating that the enzyme, like all CATs examined to date, is tetrameric. Cell-free extract from megagametophytes 7 DAI (A), pooled fractions after HTP (B), and purified CAT (C) were subjected to SDS-PACE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with cotton ICL antibodies. All lanes contain equal amounts of protein (5 ^g/lane). A 64-kD ICL band is present in A and is less evident in B but was never detected in purified CAT even when gels were overloaded (data not shown). Numerical values to the right and left of the gel are molecular masses (in kD) of protein standards.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from\n\nCopyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.\n\nPurified CAT did not react with Schiff's reagent (Zacharius et al., 1969), indicating that it is not a glycoprotein (data not shown). Consistent with most known plant CATs (Eising and Gerhardt, 1986;Yamaguchi et al., 1986), the A 2m /Ar atio for the purified loblolly pine enzyme was 1.5 (data not shown). This value is consistent with the presence of three to four heme groups per enzyme molecule (Eising and Gerhardt, 1986). The presence of multiple isoforms of CAT has been reported for a number of plant sources. To identify and characterize CAT isoforms in loblolly pine, cell-free extracts of megagametophytes taken 7 DAI (peak cell-free extract CAT activity; data not shown) were subjected to nondenaturing IEF (Fig. 3A). When gels were stained for CAT activity, four separate isoforms were consistently visualized, including one dominant form (isoform C). On some gels, two additional isoforms were seen (isoforms A and F), but because of their low activity they were difficult to resolve when photographed. When compared to that of cotton cotyledon extracts, the electrophoretic pattern of CAT isoforms from loblolly pine appears quite different (Fig. 3), suggesting that the CATisoforms families from both organisms are distinct.\n\nFollowing a number of precautions outlined by other laboratories interested in CAT multiplicity (Morikoffer-Zwez et al., 1969;Holmes and Masters, 1972;Kunce and Trelease, 1986), we have demonstrated that the electrophoretic pattern of loblolly pine CAT isoforms is not the result of limited proteolysis, enzyme aging, or electrophoretic conditions. The same pattern was observed when extractions included either 20 HIM 2-mercaptoethanol or 100 mM EDTA, when gels were pre-electrophoresed, or when protease inhibitors such as leupeptin (1 HIM), PMSF (2 mM), and/or benzamidine-HCL and dark-grown cotton cotyledons 4 DAI (B) were subjected to nondenaturing IEF and stained for CAT activity. Because of printing, isoforms A and F from loblolly pine megagametophytes were observed only in the original gel (see lane A). CAT isoforms from cotton (A-E) are those described by Kunce and Trelease (1986). All samples contained 20 mM DTT and were electrophoresed immediately after extraction. The pi for each isoform of loblolly pine is indicated to the left of A. (1 HIM) were included (data not shown). In fact, the only rime aberrations in the CAT isoform pattern were observed was when extractions were not carried out in the presence of DTT. Kunce and Trelease (1986) previously described the importance of the inclusion of DTT in all extraction buffers when examining the heterogeneity of CAT in cotton.\n\nWhen examined through a number of developmental stages including poststratification, germination, and postgermative growth, isoform C (Fig. 3A, pi 6.87) was consistently the major CAT form in the megagametophyte (data not shown). Because only one band is detected on SDS-PAGE either by staining of purified CAT with Coomassie blue (Fig. l, lane F) or by probing with cotton or loblolly pine CAT antibodies following immunoblotting of crude or purified samples (data not shown), we believe the CAT isoforms differ on the basis of charge.\n\nTo demonstrate the monospecificity of loblolly pine CAT antibodies, the separation of CAT from contaminating ICL during the purification procedure was examined. Protein immunoblots comparing cotton and pine anti-CAT immunoreactive polypeptides were analyzed (data not shown). Even when gels were greatly overloaded or when serum was diluted to 1:50 (as opposed to 1:1000), the 64-kD band (ICL) that reacted when probed with cotton ICL antibodies was not revealed on an immunoblot of the final CAT preparation (Fig. 2). However, both loblolly pine and cotton CAT antibodies reacted with the same single band, migrating and corresponding to the monomeric form of purified loblolly pine CAT (59 kD) (data not shown). Similarly, the fidelity of loblolly pine CAT antibodies was demonstrated by the serum's ability to effectively immunotitrate all CAT activity from megagametophyte extracts 7 DAI. However, neither potential contaminant during the purification procedure (i.e. ICL and MS) was affected by the addition of CAT antiserum (data not shown). Loblolly pine CAT antibodies cross-reacted with a single polypeptide on immunoblots of cell-free extracts of megagametophytes taken from germinated seeds of white spruce, lodgepole pine, and Douglas fir and two angiosperms, castor bean and cotton (Fig. 4). The subunit molecular mass of cotton CAT was 57 kD (Fig. 4B), whereas it was 59 kD for all other species examined, including castor bean (Fig. 4).\n\nTo determine whether the subunit molecular mass of CAT from loblolly pine underwent any changes following mature seed imbibition, megagametophytes and seedlings were taken at various stages, and immunoblots were probed with loblolly pine CAT antibodies (Fig. 5). Cell-free extracts from megagametophytes isolated from mature seeds, stratified seeds, germinated seeds (7 DAI), and purified CAT fractions all reacted with CAT antibodies, and a single, 59-kD band appeared on all blots, indicating that at no time during stratification and postgerminative growth, or during purification, was the monomeric molecular mass of CAT altered. Loblolly pine glyoxysomal CAT is the same size as that from cell-free extracts (59 kD), indicating that no artifactual degradation of CAT occurs by endogenous proteases following its extraction and purification. It remains to be determined whether CAT undergoes any posttranslational modification via proteolytic cleavage of a signal peptide during glyoxysomal import. Yamaguchi et al. (1986) and Kunce et al. (1988) both demonstrated the existence of only one CAT polypeptide from cell-free extracts and isolated glyoxysomes and peroxisomes from pumpkin and cotton cotyledons, respectively. With the apparent consistencies between loblolly pine and angiosperm CAT as already discussed in this paper, it is likely that similar precursor processing, or lack of, might be occurring in loblolly pine.\n\nDespite consistencies in CAT monomeric molecular mass, it remains to be determined whether CAT isoforms undergo any transitions during postgerminative growth. In fact, the availability of monospecific antibodies to CAT will allow us to examine and compare the enzyme in both the haploid maternal megagametophyte and the diploid embryo. In the former, after storage reserves are utilized, the tissue will eventually senesce, whereas embryonic tissue undergoing a change from heterotrophy to autotrophy will display an accompanying glyoxysome to peroxisome transition (Lopez-Perez et al., 1974;Huang et al., 1983). This point is especially interesting when considering the observation that the same 59-kD polypeptide from isolated seedling extracts was recognized by the megagametophytic CAT antibodies (Fig. 5, lane A), suggesting that the CAT families of these two distinct tissue types may be quite similar.\n\na CAT activity was assayed after (NH4)*S04 precipitation and overnight dialysis.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.
