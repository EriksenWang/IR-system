    "abstract": "The performance of fiber-reinforced composites is often controlled by the properties of the fiber-matrix interface. Good interfacial bonding (or adhesion), to ensure load transfer from matrix to reinforcement, is a primary requirement for effective use of reinforcement properties. Thus, a fundamental understanding of interfacial properties and a quantitative characterization of interfacial adhesion strength can help in evaluating the mechanical behavior and capabilities of composite materials. A large number of analytical techniques have been developed for understanding interfacial adhesion of glass fiber reinforced polymers. Common adhesion tests include contact angle measurements, tension or compression of specially shaped blocks of polymer containing a single fiber, the single fiber pull-out test, single-fiber fragmentation test, short beam shear and transverse tensile tests, and the vibration damping test. Among these techniques, the vibration damping technique has the advantage of being nondestructive as well as highly sensitive for evaluating the interfacial region, and it can allow the materials industry to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of composites.\nIn this work, we contributed a simple optical system for measuring the damping factor of uniaxial fiber-reinforced-polymer composites in the shape of cantilever beams. A single glass fiber-and three single metallic wire-reinforced epoxy resin composites were tested with the optical system. The fiber-(wire-) matrix interfacial adhesion strength measurements were made by microbond test. A reasonable agreement was found between the measured interfacial adhesion strength and micromechanics calculations using results from vibration damping experiments. The study was also extended to multi-fiber composites. The interfacial damping factors in glass-fiber reinforced epoxy-resin composites were correlated with transverse tensile strength, which is a qualitative measurement of adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface. Four different composite systems were tested. For each system, glass fibers with three different surface treatments were used at three different volume fractions. The experimental results also showed an inverse relationship between damping contributed by the interface and composite transverse tensile strength for all of the multi-fiber composites.",

CHAPTER 1\n\nFiber-reinforced composite materials are being more widely used in many applications.\n\nThe glass fiber composites have been used a great deal in chemical plants under hostile environments because of their good resistance to corrosion. They are also being used increasingly in automobiles, trucks, and other vehicles because of substantial weight reductions, and simplified manufacturing. With the increasing applications of these materials, more and more knowledge is needed to get a better understanding of the bonding of the materials, which can lead to different mechanical properties of the materials. It is also necessary to find a simple method to measure those behaviors.\n\nUniaxial fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) are the simplest examples of composite materials. The properties obtained from these materials can be analyzed and modeled easily without considering other geometric parameters such as fiber length and fiber orientation. With a good knowledge of the properties for this type of material, an extension can be made to understand the properties of other composite materials.\n\nIt is well known that fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion plays an important role to improve mechanical properties of a composite. The tensile strength of the composite depends on the ability of the composite to effectively transfer tensile load from the matrix to the fiber via shear at the interface. Thus, a procedure to quantify the interfacial adhesion would contribute to an evaluation of the mechanical behavior of composite materials.\n\nA large number of experimental techniques have been developed [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] for measuring interfacial adhesion in fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Among these techniques, vibration damping is promising because it provides a sensitive and nondestructive evaluation of the interfacial region, and can allow the materials industry to rapidly determine the interfacial adhesion strength of composites. Therefore, this non-destructive method would represent a valuable contribution in the evaluating mechanical performance of composite materials.\n\nIt is widely recognized that the interfacial bonding of a composite can be related to a change in energy absorbing ability, i.e., damping of the material. While theoretical and experimental analyses are reported which support the validity of the concept [14,15], there is presently no direct quantitative relation between interfacial damping and interfacial adhesion strength in the published work.\n\nTherefore, the main objectives of this research are to: (1) develop a simple, noncontact optical technique based on vibration damping for measuring the interfacial adhesion of composites; (2) experimentally investigate the correlation between dynamic (vibration damping) adhesion measurements and static interfacial properties (interfacial adhesion strength) through an application to a specific series of fiber-reinforced polymer composites; (3) attempt to develop a model based on cantilever beam vibration to evaluate the adhesion between fiber and matrix from vibration damping data. The fiber volume fraction effect on the interfacial adhesion will also be studied.\n\nThis research is significant in that it not only provides a fundamental understanding of interfacial adhesion but also introduces a novel experimental technique. The interfacial adhesion between the fiber and matrix of a composite can be easily evaluated by a vibration damping technique without conducting tedious destructive experiments. With the relationship between the dynamic and static adhesion measurements, the interfacial adhesion strength, Ï, can be easily obtained from the interfacial damping factor tan Î´ in .\n\nThe thesis is organized as follows:\n\nChapter 2 presents a literature review with four topics to get a better understanding of the background of the present research. It contains a review of techniques used to measure fibermatrix adhesion of composites, vibration damping concepts and mechanisms, damping in composite materials and earlier research on interfacial damping of fiber-reinforced polymer composites.\n\nChapter 3 describes sample preparation and the experimental system developed to measure the interfacial adhesion of composites.\n\nExperimental results are presented in Chapter 4, which include both vibration damping and direct interfacial adhesion (fiber pull-out and transverse tensile tests) measurements.\n\nChapter 5 is the discussion. A micromechanics model for evaluating the adhesion between fiber and matrix from damping factor of a cantilever beam is described, in which a quantitative inverse relationship between damping factor contributed by the interface and interfacial adhesion strength is established. The vibration damping measurements of single fiber-reinforced composites are compared with interfacial adhesion strength of the materials by the developed model. For real composites, interfacial damping data are compared with transverse tensile strength which is also a qualitative measurement of adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 6, the results of the present research are summarized.\n\nTheoretical and experimental work on interfacial adhesion measurements of fiberreinforced polymer composites has been extensively pursued in recent years. This chapter provides a brief review of the commonly used techniques for measuring fiber-matrix adhesion.\n\nDue to the application of the vibration damping method in the present research, the general background of vibration damping is introduced and the mechanisms are discussed. The concept of interfacial damping which can be used to evaluate interfacial adhesion is also introduced.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the adhesion between the fiber and the matrix has an effect on the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites [16,17]. In particular, the tensile strength of the composite is affected by efficiency of load transfer from the matrix to fiber via shear at the interface. Therefore, a number of mechanical tests have been developed to measure the capacity of the interface to transfer stress from the matrix to the fiber in a composite.\n\nThe interfacial properties were first measured with an indirect compression method suggested by Broutman [1] in 1966. With the improvement of techniques in the following years, many testing methods were applied. Currently, four techniques suitable for evaluating actual reinforcing fiber-matrix adhesion strength have become widely used. These mechanical tests were summarized by Piggott [2] and are illustrated in Figure 2.1.\n\nThe pull-out [3] and microtension [4] (or called microbond pull-out) methods are basically equivalent. In the pull-out method, the fiber is embedded in a solid matrix material and pulled with an increasing force. A plot of force at the instant of debonding, F d , versus embedded length, l, has been used to estimate the interfacial adhesion strength, Ï , for fibers with a diameter 2r:\n\nThis test was originally applied to glass fiber-reinforced concrete and carbon filament-reinforced aluminum, and has been adapted by Favre and co-workers for use with FRP composites [5]. As demonstrated with many systems, it has been shown that the pull-out test is relatively easy to carry out with rod or thick fibers. However, when fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion is strong and fiber diameter is small (< 10 Âµm, for example), the embedded fiber length must be very small.\n\nOtherwise, it will result in the fiber breakage instead of pulling the fiber out of the matrix.\n\nThe microtension or microbond test was developed by Miller et al. [4] to prepare pull-out samples with very small embedded fiber length. In this method, the fiber is embedded in a small axisymmertrical drop of resin and pulled out. It is similar to the pull-out test, and F d is plotted versus the bonded area or bond length to estimate the adhesion strength of the interface.\n\nThe microcompression or microindentation test was reported first by Mandell et al. [6].\n\nThis technique is becoming popular [7,8], which uses a small indenter to debond a fiber as shown in Figure 2.1. A composite specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the fiber axis, the end of a single fiber is compressively loaded with a very fine diamond tip, and the fiber is pushed down from the composite. With a finite-element analysis it is possible to estimate the shear stress at the instant of debonding.\n\nThe single fiber fragmentation test [9] has been used widely in recent years [10]. In this method, a single fiber is embedded in a polymer resin with a mold to form a dogbone shape tensile specimen. When the dogbone specimen is stretched in the fiber axial direction, the fiber breaks into small fragments, until finally the fiber lengths are all less than a critical length, l c . Acoustic emission provides a reliable means for determining the number of breaks, and hence the average value of l c [11]. The interfacial adhesion stress, Ï , is estimated from l c assuming that it is constant along the fiber length.\n\nwhere Ï fu is the fiber strength. Weibull statistics are usually applied to estimate Ï fu [12].\n\nEach of the methods mentioned above has inherent problems that limit its applicability as a universal test method for characterization of interfacial adhesion strength [13]. All of these techniques deal with individual fibers but not fibers in a real composite and may not reflect the overall interfacial property of the composites. Due to the complexity of the behavior of the interface, it is not clear at the present time that a correlation exists between the results obtained among the test methods described above. Therefore, when the interfacial adhesion strength is mentioned, it is usually reference to a specific test method.\n\nBesides those destructive methods mentioned above, some nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques [18] such as radiography, acoustic emission, thermal NDE methods, optical methods, vibration damping techniques, corona discharge and chemical spectroscopy, have also been applied to characterize the fiber-reinforced composites. Among these techniques, the vibration damping method, which is based on energy dissipation theory, has been increasingly used for measuring interfacial adhesion. The principle of the method is based on the theory of energy dissipation. According to the theory, quality of interfacial adhesion in composites can be evaluated by measuring the part of energy dissipation contributed by the interfaces, assuming that the interface part can be obtained by separating those of matrix and fiber from the total composites. The energy dissipation of a material can be evaluated by the damping of the material.\n\nNowick and Berry [19] summarized the techniques currently used for measuring vibration damping of materials and structures. The techniques for the measurement of damping often deal with natural frequency or resonant frequency of a system. In general, all apparatus for the investigation of vibration can be categorized as free vibration (or free decay) and forced vibration.\n\nFree vibration is executed by a system in the absence of any external input except the initial condition inputs of displacement and velocity. For example, it is possible to have a wire sample gripped at the top, and have a large weight hanging freely at the bottom; this system can be set either into longitudinal or torsional oscillation. The latter represents the well-known \"torsion pendulum\", developed by K [20] in which the strain at any point can be expressed in terms of the angular twist of the inertia member.\n\nFor a forced vibration, a periodic exciting force is applied to the mass. When the resonant frequency is achieved, the loss angle Î´ is obtainable directly from the width of the resonance peak at half-maximum in a plot of (amplitude) 2 versus frequency. Typical forced vibration techniques include the free-free beam technique [21] and the piezoelectric ultrasonic composite oscillator technique (PUCOT) [22][23][24]. These techniques have been applied to dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) which is a widely used technique in polymer studies, and has attracted even more attention for interface characterization. However, the instrument is relatively expensive and can not be operated at a high frequency which can reflect more information from the tested materials.\n\nBecause vibration damping is increasingly being applied to characterize interfacial adhesion, it is necessary to understand the origin of damping. In the following section, a brief description of currently known damping mechanisms will be introduced.\n\nDamping in principle is the mechanism by which the ordered mechanical energy of a material or a system is dissipated as disordered thermal energy to its surroundings as an irreversible process. It is observed that all free vibrations cannot keep going indefinitely and will die out ultimately. In other words, there is some resistance to the motion of the body.\n\nGemant [25] gives an excellent summary of vibration damping. According to his analysis, a simple model for describing forced vibration of a body with internal resistance is given by the following general differential equation based on Newton's second law:\n\nHere t represents time and x is the time-varying displacement; F is the external force. The second term on the left-hand side of Equation (2.3) is the damping term which is ideally considered as viscous damping, and the constant of proportionality c is called the viscous damping coefficient;\n\nthe third term on the left-hand side of the equation is the elastic term, k is the stiffness, depending on the elastic modulus and a shape factor; the term on the right-hand side of the equation is the inertia force, and m is the mass of the body. The natural frequencies can be found without consideration of the damping effect in the case of free vibration, and the amplitude vs. frequency characteristic in most cases of forced vibrations.\n\nThe damping term, introduced into Equation (2.3), can be explained as follows.\n\nIf a body undergoes free vibration, i.e. there is no F term in Equation (2.3), the differential equation can be solved to lead to the following expression for the amplitude x [25]:\n\nHere x 0 is the amplitude at time t = 0; Ï 0 is the natural frequency; Ï is the phase angle; Ï d is called the dynamic frequency and is defined as\n\nÎ¶ is the damping factor that is related to the logarithmic decrement d and will be explained later:\n\nWhen damping is small,\n\nThe decay of the vibration is exponential according to Equation (2.4), which was verified by observations. In reality, Î¶ depends on the initial amplitude of the deformation, but it is still possible to obtain an average value of Î¶ from the decay curves.\n\nAs just introduced above, another quantity, the logarithmic decrement d is often used in preference to Î¶ ; it is the logarithm of the ratio of amplitudes one period of vibration apart. If n is the number of cycles of the vibration, x 0 is the amplitude of the first vibration, and x n is amplitude of the n th vibration, then [25]\n\nIt is known that the energy of vibration is proportional to the square of the amplitude, the relative loss of vibrational energy (âW/W) is then given by\n\nwhere âW is the energy dissipation in a cycle and W is the maximum stored elastic energy of the system. Î¨ is called the specific damping capacity which has an easily visualizable meaning.\n\nAnother way to find âW and W is the concept of complex modulus which can be physically explained by considering the phase difference between sinusoidally varying stress and strain for uniaxial loading [26]. According to the basic hysteresis response in a structure which is subjected to an alternating force, an alternating strain lags behind the corresponding alternating stress by a phase angle Î´ , see Figure 2.2.\n\nFor a periodic stress imposed on a specimen, the relation for stress Ï and strain Îµ are given by Ï Ï Ï = 0 exp( ) i t (2.9a)\n\nwhere Ï 0 and Îµ 0 are the stress and strain amplitudes, Ï Ï = 2 f is the circular (or angular) frequency (f is the vibrational frequency). In a perfectly elastic material, Î´ = 0 and Ï Îµ / = E , i.e., the elastic modulus. However, most materials are anelastic, so d is not zero and the ratio Ï Îµ / is complex. This complex modulus may be expressed as\n\nwhere E( ) Ï is the absolute dynamic modulus. The complex modulus may also be expressed as\n\nwhere â² E ( )\n\nand â²â² E ( ) Ï are the real and imaginary parts of E * ( ) Ï , respectively. From the appropriate vector diagram, it is easy to show that E E E 2 2 2 = â² + â²â² (2.12a) and tan / Î´ = â²â² â² E E (2.12b) Alternatively, â² E and â²â² E are also called the storage modulus and loss modulus, respectively, and they are related to the energy stored, W, and energy dissipated, âW, per cycle of vibration by\n\nwhere the stress-strain curve is assumed to be linear. Hence, the specific damping capacity (Î¨ ), or SDC, is given by\n\ntan Î´ sometimes is also called the loss coefficient, Î· . By comparing Equations (2.8),\n\n(2.14) and (2.6), the following relationship of different damping characteristics can be easily derived [25,27]:\n\nThere are several ways to set up the vibration damping experiment in practice. A frequently used method is to gather the experimental data concerning dynamic material behavior by studying the free and forced transverse vibrations of cantilever beams made of the material.\n\nThe information on beam behavior collected in the experiments was interpreted by comparing it with the behavior of a uniform, homogenous Bernoulli-Euler cantilever beam, vibrating in its various principal modes. The general response of the vibration is similar to Equation (2.4) [28,29].\n\nThe widely accepted experiment was done by detecting the response of the cantilever beam excited by a vibration exciter. Resonant frequencies were determined by observing the peaking of response with varying excitation frequency at constant excitation amplitude. Free vibration decay measurements were usually made by exciting the beam at a resonant frequency, cutting power to the exciter, and analyzing the decay trace.\n\nIf the cantilever beam is excited in another way, such as deflected with a pin (i.e., a predisplacement is given), then the pin is retracted to initiate vibration. The frequency and damping ratio can also be obtained by analyzing the decay trace. However, there are some problems with this type of set-up. The reasons are explained as follows.\n\nWhen a cantilever beam is excited by a pre-displacement, the beam is vibrated with a frequency which is primarily composed of its first mode of vibration, and it can be understood by noting the vibrating shape (refer to Figure 2.3). However, the response is the linear combination of all of the modes because it is not vibrated with an exact resonant frequency, otherwise it is not a frequency controlled exciting.\n\nAs it was stated in section 2.2.1, damping in principle is the mechanism by which the ordered mechanical energy of the material or the system is dissipated as disordered thermal energy to the environment in an irreversible manner. The origin and mechanism of damping are complex and sometimes difficult to comprehend. There are several theories to explain the phenomenon, which can be divided into two categories, i.e., macro-and micro-mechanisms. In the following description, all possible damping mechanisms will be introduced first, and then the attention will be focused on those of polymers and their composites.\n\n(\n\nThe macro-mechanisms are those that involve the entire process of the vibration damping.\n\nIt is known that material damping represents a departure from ideally elastic behavior, which implies that the strain induced by an applied stress contains contributions of either a plastic or viscoelastic nature. In fact, damping is closely related to internal friction of the material which is also a measure of energy dissipation in the material. It appears that there are two entirely different processes that lead to losses during mechanical vibrations. One is a thermal process, and another one is a strict consequence of the plastic flow of solids. Both appear to be general and of about equal significance.\n\nGenerally speaking, thermal losses will occur in inhomogeneous materials, such as in polycrystalline metals which consist of a large number of grains. These losses occur only if the material has volume changes; bending and longitudinal vibration usually cause the losses. In the case of pure shear (torsion), these losses will not exist. It has been shown [30,31] that, d, due to thermal loss, should be independent of the strain amplitude Îµ 0 .\n\nPlastic losses, on the other hand, will occur in any material, but presumably most readily in single crystals in which slip occurs easily, and also in materials of low creep resistance such as lead, and the whole group of organic plastics. These losses occur independent of the nature of strain. Either compression or shear can cause the losses. With increasing temperature these losses obviously will be favored. d increases with increasing the strain amplitude. This mechanism is frequency dependent; generally there should be a decrease of d with increasing frequency.\n\nThe thermoelastic effect is thermodynamically convertible, which is just like the phenomenon of thermal expansion. When a material is rapidly deformed under an inhomogeneousstress, local temperature differences are produced depending upon the local stress levels and properties of the material. Consequently, temperature gradients formed within the material tend to produce heat flow unless the load is quickly released. Under high-frequency vibration, the time for significant heat flow is insufficient and the process remains adiabatic and reversible; thus, the observed damping is small. On the other hand, if the frequency is very low, the process is still reversible because it remains isothermal. Therefore there is still no significant dissipated damping energy. However, when a critical frequency is reached, the period of the cyclic stress is comparable with the time required for significant heat flow along the temperature gradients produced, an irreversible conversion of mechanical energy into heat occurs and damping will be observed.\n\nMacro-thermoelastic damping occurs in many types of materials and vibrations. For example, damping of a German silver * beam was tested under flexural vibration, both the experimental points [32] and the theoretical curve [33] illustrate the general shape of the damping or relaxation peak. Similar thermoelastic effects can also be found in longitudinally vibrated bars [34].\n\nIt is evident that in the case of vibrations, a plastic flow accompanied with elastic displacements must result in damping. This effect can easily be visualized by the so-called hysteresis loop. The area covered by the loop is the hysteresis loss for the complete cycle. If it is assumed that the shape of the loop does not depend upon the vibrating speed, then the hysteresis loss may be considered independent of the frequency. The loop can be identified with the specific loss, or the loss per cycle for alternating vibration, denoted by âW as mentioned above. From Equation (2.7) the logarithmic decrement d can be immediately obtained.\n\n(\n\nWhen further consideration is taken of the damping mechanisms, it is necessary to consider the internal structures of materials which can have great effect on the energy dissipation because defects of materials are obviously influenced by the applied stress. After continuous study and measurement by metallurgists and physicists on the details of single crystal and polycrystalline materials [35,36 ] some common defects that provide mechanisms for damping were proposed, which include concentration of point defects (Snoek [37] and Zener [38] relaxations), dislocation motion, grain boundaries, phase transformations, and differential temperatures between the specimen and its surroundings or between one part of the specimen and another part (thermalelastic or Zener damping).\n\nMicrographically, crystalline materials generally have many types of defects (vacancies or extra atoms) or impurities [31] which produce a local non-symmetry in the crystal. As a consequence, it will reduce the symmetry of the crystal; crystallographically equivalent positions or sites in the crystal will be occupied by the point defects. This type of imperfection is termed defect symmetry and leads to anelastic behavior. Under cyclic stress such \"defective microstructures\" will dissipate energy and produce hysteretic loop or damping effects. These operative micromechanisms have been identified and equations defining their characteristics have been developed by Nowick [31].\n\nGrain boundaries of a polycrystalline material are in a relatively disordered state and display viscous-like properties. Therefore, the unit energy dissipated in grain boundaries under cyclic shear stress or strain is larger, in general, than that dissipated within the grain [39]. The damping associated with grain boundary shear thus depends on the shear properties of the grain boundary which is a function of temperature, and also of strain rate (or frequency).\n\nIf only the shear effects are considered, according to the definition, the energy dissipated by grain boundary migration is proportional to the product of the shear stress and anelastic shear strain. When the vibration frequencies are high or the temperature is low, the shear stress across a grain boundary can relax only slightly during a vibration cycle and material still remains elastic.\n\nThus, although the shear stress may be large, the anelastic shear strain is small, and the hysteresis loop is narrow, small damping will be observed. By contrast, when the vibration frequencies are low or the temperature is high, large stress relaxation can occur under cyclic strain and the shear stress is correspondingly reduced. In this case, the area within the hysteresis loop is still small. However, at some intermediate condition, the rate of stress relaxation is optimum for producing the maximum area within the hysteresis loop, the maximum damping will be observed.\n\nDislocation damping plays an important role in crystalline materials. When a crystalline material is deformed under an alternating stress, the dislocation movement may lag behind the applied stress. As a sequence a hysteretic loop will be formed, which is contributed to the energy dissipation. If it is assumed that the dislocations are perfectly mobile without any restriction on their motion, the estimated magnitude of damping effect for typical dislocation densities would be much larger than that observed experimentally. Therefore, impediments to the motion of dislocations or other types of interactions must be considered. Such impediments can be pinning points, network points, jogs, and other dislocations.\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to dissipate energy the dislocation motion must lag behind the applied stress. One generally accepted dislocation model for damping was proposed by Koeher [40] and further developed by Granato and Luecke [41] (termed G-L model hereafter).\n\nIn this model dislocation motions are viewed as being analogous to a vibrating string in a viscous medium. By considering the effective mass per unit length and the effective tension in the dislocation, a differential equation for the model can be written as [42] A y t\n\nwhere A is the effective mass per unit length, B the viscous damping constant, C the tension force, b the Burgers vector and Ï the applied stress.\n\nAt low frequencies, the velocity of the dislocation is small, which means that the viscous force and damping are small. In these cases the displacement, y, is limited by the tension forces in the dislocation and it appears parabolic in shape. As the frequency increases, the viscous forces become dominant and the displacement of dislocation cannot achieve its full parabolic values.\n\nUnder these circumstances it behaves like a rigid rod except for curvature at its ends near the pinning points. At very high frequency the drag forces may be large but the displacement is very small, therefore the damping is still small. At some intermediate or optimum frequency the integral of the drag forces and displacement is maximum and thus the damping is maximum.\n\nThermal currents not only lead to damping macroscopically, but also they can exist on a microscopic scale. This phenomenon was observed in polycrystalline materials.\n\nIt is well known that in a polycrystalline material, individual crystals are generally anisotropic with different thermal and mechanical properties in the direction of principal stresses.\n\nLocal temperature gradients are therefore produced even though the material is under macroscopically uniform axial stress. If a cyclic stress is applied to the material, this microanisotropy can cause cyclic micro-thermal currents across grain boundaries. This process also causes some energy dissipation [35]. At certain combinations of temperature and frequency the energy dissipation effects are maximized. In other words, the damping peak or the relaxation peak can be observed.\n\n(\n\nIn the foregoing introduction, the damping mechanisms are mainly dealt with metallic materials. What are, however, the damping mechanisms of nonmetallic materials such as wood, stone, glass, and (especially) polymers? So far, little is known about the important micromechanisms in most nonmetallic materials.\n\nIn fact, much work has been done on polymers although little is known about damping mechanisms of most other nonmetallic materials because of their complex structure.\n\nIt is known that with larger molecules and those with long-range molecular order, polymers behave with both elastic and viscous characteristics. This means their properties are intermediate between that of a crystalline solid and a simple liquid. By changing the monomeric units, the molecular weight, degree of branching and crosslinking, the main chain stereo configuration of monomers, and other features of the molecular chemistry, the desired mechanical properties can be obtained. High damping is an important behavior of polymers. It has been known that damping in most polymers is dependent on frequency and temperature. A critical temperature, T g , and frequency, Ï c , at which a polymer has the maximum damping is always observed [26].\n\nKaelble [43] described the micromechanisms of damping in polymers based on microstructure and phenomenology, and classified them into three basic categories: secondary transition; glass transition; melting and flow.\n\nIt is well known that at temperatures near absolute zero, the main source of motion in polymers is provided by the bending and stretching of primary valence bonds. When temperatures increase, but still below the glass transition temperature T g at which the polymer undergoes the transformation from a rubber to a glass, side groups can move and will cause dynamic dispersions.\n\nThe magnitude of the peaks in tan Î´ in this case are usually smaller than those obtained at T g , and such phenomena are called as \"secondary transitions\" and are associated with the character of the monomeric structure of the polymer.\n\nThere is particularly strong damping at the glass transition temperature, T g . This critical temperature is governed by the main chain in the amorphous phase of the polymer. The length of the chain segment is small compared that of macromolecule but is larger than the monomer group.\n\nSegment motion involves the coiling and uncoiling of sections of the macromolecular chain. It has been found that significant damping occurs at T g when the applied test frequency equals the natural frequency for main chain rotation. If frequencies are higher, the time for chain uncoiling is insufficient, and the polymer will appear to be relative stiff. When frequencies are lower, the time for chain movement is larger and the material will be soft and rubbery.\n\nBetween the glass transition temperature T g and the crystalline melting temperature T m , the damping response of polymers is insensitive to temperature. The high-temperature limits of this elastomeric region of response is determined by the melting and flow properties of the macromolecule. If the macromolecule is incorporated into a three-dimensional crosslinked network, the high-temperature limits of elastomeric response are restricted only by the thermal and environmental stability of the chemical valence bonds.\n\nIn the foregoing section, damping mechanisms of common materials have been discussed.\n\nThese can be referred to as intrinsic mechanisms. However, if two or more materials are combined together to form a composite, the properties of the composite are governed not only by the properties of individual components but also by the interface between them. When the composite undergoes vibration damping, additional mechanisms, known as extrinsic mechanisms, will be introduced.\n\nComposite materials fall into two categories: fiber reinforced and particle (or whisker) reinforced composite materials. Both are widely used in advanced structures. Among the various kinds of composites, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites have become more and more important in engineering applications because of their low cost, light weight and good corrosion resistance. Successful reinforcement of these composite materials is only achieved by obtaining sufficient load transfer between fiber and matrix. However, an extremely strong interfacial bond is not always desirable. In some cases, a weak interface is desirable to promote fiber pull-out, hence providing a tougher composite system. It would also be desirable to design the interfacial properties to suit a particular application.\n\nIn the first section of this chapter, the existing techniques for measuring interfacial adhesion have been reviewed. Among those techniques, it has been shown that vibration damping is promising because it provides a sensitive and nondestructive evaluation of the interfacial region. In the next section the principle of the technique will be discussed.\n\nThe damping of fiber reinforced composite materials has been studied extensively [44,45].\n\nAll of the published results for continuous fiber reinforced composites show that when strain levels are low the damping characteristics do not depend on strain amplitude but are dependent on fiber orientation, temperature, moisture absorption, frequency, and matrix properties. Fiber properties have only minimal effects. However, for discontinuous fiber reinforced composites it has been shown that the damping characteristics in the fiber direction are much greater than that obtained continuous fiber reinforced composites.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that the main sources of damping in a composite material come from microplastic or viscoelastic phenomena associated with the matrix and slippage at the interface between the matrix and the reinforcement. Therefore, besides the contribution from any cracks, debonds and the orientation of the reinforcement, composite damping will be affected by the following factors:\n\n1. the properties and the volume fraction of matrix and reinforcement in the composite;\n\n2. the size of the reinforcement;\n\n3. the surface treatment of the reinforcement.\n\nIt is clear that the explanation of damping in composite materials is a very complex matter, to which much research has been dedicated.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, one unique characteristic of a composite is its large internal interfacial area. Thus, in analyzing the damping of a composite it is important to consider not only the individual component materials but also the energy dissipation caused by the interface. Therefore, the damping analysis of a composite generally requires a recognition of the individual components in the composite and a determination of their contributions to the total composite [46].\n\nThus, extrinsic damping mechanisms in a composite are mainly related to the reinforcement-matrix interfaces. For a poorly bonded interface, the damping can be caused by a sliding friction mechanism (Coulomb friction). On the other hand, if an interface is well-bonded, it could also lead to increased damping via an increased dislocation density near the fiber-matrix interface although this mechanism usually is not valid for polymer matrix composites because noncrystallized polymers are applied in most cases.\n\nIn this section a review of papers on interfacial damping in FRP will be presented in order to define the objectives of the present research.\n\nOne way to define interfacial bond in a composite methematically is that it has zero thickness and is the result of the interaction between fiber surface and matrix. It can be divided into three levels: weak, ideal and strong. Generally speaking, ideal interfaces simply play the role of effectively transferring load and do not contribute to damping. In such a case, the composite damping term ( tan Î´ s ) can be estimated from the rule of mixtures (ROM). For a reinforcement with low damping, tan Î´ f = 0 and Nielsen [47]. suggested that:\n\nwhere tan Î´ s is the effective loss tangent for a composite without consideration of interfacial adhesion, V represents volume fraction. Subscripts m and f refer to the fiber and matrix, respectively.\n\nIn practice, the interface region often participates in the damping of composites.\n\nDepending on composite type and the level of interfacial bonding, different approaches have been proposed to estimate the contribution of the interfaces to the damping of the composites.\n\nAccording to the theory of energy dissipation, the quality of the interfacial adhesion in composites can be evaluated by measuring the part of energy dissipation contributed by the interfaces; the interface part can be obtained by separating the matrix and fiber from the total composites.\n\nZorowski and Murayama [14] were the first to develop a method for measuring the quality of the interfacial adhesion in reinforced rubber through energy dissipation measurements based upon the following relationship:\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, subscript c refers to composite. tan Î´ in is the internal energy dissipation from interface, and tan Î´ c is the measured internal energy dissipation of the composite. By measuring the total system energy dissipation in terms of tanÎ´ and knowing tan Î´ and the dynamic moduli of the components as well as the volume fraction of fibers, the dissipation due to poor interfacial adhesion can be determined. From experimental work done by Murayama et al. [15], the energy loss at interfaces was also found to directly relate to the strip adhesion peeling load for nylon and PET fiber reinforced vulcanized rubber composites. The higher the damping contributed by the interface, the weaker the interfacial adhesion. This result is shown in Figure 2.5.\n\nMuch work has been carried out to correlate damping characteristics with interfacial structure and properties.\n\nGibson and Plunkett [48] studied crossly laminated glass-epoxy composite beams by using steady-state forced vibration tests. The results showed that the damping increases slightly with increasing maximum strain during the first run of the vibration. When the strain level is reduced, the damping remains near the same indicating permanent structure change. They attributed the phenomenon to Coulumb friction at the newly-created crack interfaces.\n\nBy introducing cracks in composite samples, Adams et al. [49] found that damage on specimens fabricated from fiber reinforced polymers could be detected by damping increasing whether this damage is localized as a crack, or distributed through the whole specimens as many microcracks. They also studied dynamic torsion of specimens with high volume fraction of fibers at different amplitudes [50], and demonstrated a significant increase in damping of the composites with increasing strains. The results were explained as the propagation of the delaminated cracks.\n\nIn order to improve the interfacial adhesion, surface modification of reinforcing fibers has been extensively applied in industry. Cinquin et al. interface of glass fiber polyamide-66 composites, and observed a decrease in damping with the improvement of interfacial bonding. Ko et al. [52] obtained a similar result in the carbon fiberepoxy system. Contrary to other published work, Chua [53,54] reported that there was no correlation between interfacial damping measured at room temperature and interfacial adhesion strength for glass fiber-polyester composites. However, he also reported that damping at the glass transition temperature has an inverse relationship with interfacial adhesion strength and transverse flexural strength of composites.\n\nOn the basis of the principle that a composite with poor interfacial bonding tends to dissipate more energy than that with good interfacial bonding, Edie et al. [55] applied DMA tests to distinguish carbon fiber-epoxy composites with different fiber surface treatments. The provided results showed much more accuracy than standard mechanical tests.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the damping characteristics of unidirectional fiber reinforced composites depend strongly on the orientation of fibers with loading direction. Gerard et al. [56] tested fiber-epoxy composites by using the vibration damping technique. The shear stress was introduced by both torsion and short beam bending. The experiment results proved [56,57] that the damping property is more interface sensitive for short beam bending because fibers are carrying more of the load in the bending mode. Reed [58] studied glass fiber-epoxy composites and found that in flexural deformation the damping behavior of the composites becomes similar to that of the matrix when the orientation of fibers changed from 0 Â° (corresponding to conventional unidirectional composites) to 90 Â°. This result also proved that interfacial sensitivity depends strongly on the load carrying capability of the fibers; when fibers carry more load, the requirement for interfacial bonding to ensure load transfer is critical. It can be expected that more sensitive detection of the interfacial region in unidirectional composites will be obtained when flexural deformation is applied to the measurements.\n\nIn summary, the damping of a composite is largely dependent on interfacial interactions.\n\nDamping contributed from the interface, tan Î´ in , was proposed to quantify the interfacial bonding in composites although there is no direct quantitative relation between interfacial damping and interfacial adhesion strength in the published work.\n\nBased on this review, the main objective of research is to clarify the relationship between dynamic (vibration damping) adhesion measurements and static interfacial properties (interfacial adhesion strength). An optical system was developed to measure the vibration damping of a cantilever beam sample, which is simpler than DMA instrumentation. The sample in the developed system is in the condition of bending deformation and has been proved to significantly reflect interfacial damping of a composite as mentioned previously. A micromechanics model for evaluating the adhesion between fiber and matrix from vibration damping data will be introduced to discuss the experimental results.\n\nTwo categories of specimens were used in this study ï£§ single fiber and multi-fiber reinforced polymer composites. Single fiber composite specimens were designed for the purpose of direct comparison of the experimental results obtained from microbond pull-out tests and vibration damping experiments. Multi-fiber composite specimens were used as a means to compare these properties to those of composite laminates.\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, single fiber composite specimens are commonly used to evaluate interfacial adhesion by several static methods such as the pull-out test. A single fiber reinforced composite sample is also preferred in the vibration damping technique because it can be directly compared to single fiber stress analysis of the fiber pull-out test. However, the diameters of fibers should be large enough such that the fiber volume fraction of the single fiber reinforced composite is significant. The resolution of the vibration damping setup used in the experiment is then sufficient to detect the interfacial damping of a single fiber-reinforced composite. Beside glass fibers of 0.12 mm diameter, metallic wires of about 0.1 mm diameter made from copper, molybdenum or tungsten were also used as reinforcement in epoxy matrices as single-fiber composite specimens. The exact diameters of the metallic wires are 0.1 mm for both copper and tungsten, and 0.127 mm for molybdenum. Each metallic wire used here has a unique Young's modulus (copper, molybdenum and tungsten have Young's moduli about 100 GPa, 200 GPa and 300 GPa, respectively), and likely, different adhesion strengths with the epoxy resin. Both vibration damping and microbond specimens were fabricated to measure the interfacial damping and the interfacial adhesion strength.\n\nSample preparation was conducted according to the procedure suggested by the manufacture of the epoxy resin. Epon 828 TM (a trademark of Shell Chemical Company) epoxy resin (100 parts by weight) was mixed with mPDA (1, 3-Phenylenediamine flakes) curing agent (14.5 parts by weight) when mPDA is completely melted at 70 o C. The mixture was placed into a warm vacuum oven (50 o C) for 30 minutes to remove gas bubbles introduced during the mixing.\n\nThe mixture was then used for preparing the single fiber (wire) composite microbond or vibration damping specimens. For the microbond specimens, an axisymmetric drop of epoxy was placed on the fibers (wires) using a small diameter steel needle. For the vibration damping specimens, epoxy was poured into a mold with a size of 30 mm Ã 3 mm Ã 1 mm, into which the single fibers (wires)\n\nwere placed. In both instances, the prepared specimens were cured for two hours at 75 o C and two hours at 125 o C. A typical micrograph for single glass fiber-reinforced composite is shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nLaminated multi-fiber composite specimens were fabricated at the Owens Corning Science and Technology Center (Granville, OH). D.E.R. 331 epoxy resin from Dow Chemical Company and Lindride 66 curing agent from Lindau Chemicals Inc. were selected as matrix materials commonly used in the filament winding process. The reinforcement was E-glass fibers with a diameter of 10 Âµm. Four fiber systems that contained different surface treatments were investigated in this study as listed in Table 3.1. Three fiber volume fractions (about 30%, 50% and 70%) were under control to make the composite laminates.\n\nD.E.R. 331 epoxy (100 parts by weight) was mixed with Lindride 66, curing agent, (85 parts by weight). Composite laminates were fabricated using a filament winding machine and samples were cured for two hours at 120 o C and two hours at 180 o C using a hot press machine with a 1.43 MPa constant pressure. The composite laminates were then cut into specimens. For the laminates with 30% and 50% fiber volume fractions, the dimension of specimens is about 60 mm in length, 4.5 mm in width with varying thicknesses. The actual lengths of the cantilever beam were varied from 47 mm to 55 mm to obtain an identical resonant frequency. For the laminates with 70% fiber volume fraction, the composite laminates were cut into 30 mm Ã 4 mm Ã 0.5 mm specimens, and the actual length of the cantilever beam was 25 mm. Figure 3.2\n\nshows micrographs of the surface of the E-glass fiber reinforced composite laminates with untreated fiber and different fiber volume fractions. Table 3.1 The composite laminate samples used in this study Specimen Type Fiber Volume Fraction Description of Surface Treatment A 0.325; 0.525; 0.610 Untreated fiber B 0.332; 0.545; 0.677 366 size without silane C 0.341; 0.540; 0.695 366 size with silane D 0.343; 0.515; 0.716 158B size with silane (c) Figure 3.2 Continued from previous page.\n\nIn order to verify the adhesion evaluated by vibration damping and static methods, both interfacial adhesion strength measurements and vibration damping tests for a cantilever beam were conducted. For single fiber specimens, microbond pull-out tests were performed to measure the interfacial adhesion strength. For multi-fiber composite specimens, transverse tensile strength measurements were performed at the Owens Corning Science and Technology Center (Granville, OH) to characterize the interfacial adhesion properties.\n\nInterfacial adhesion strength measurements were made using the microbond fiber pull-out tests. This test was used to measure the force required to debond drops of cured epoxy resin from different fibers (or wires). Figure 3.3 is a schematic diagram of the microbond setup. One end of the fiber (wire) was fixed with adhesive to a hole-punched metal tab which is connected to a balance. The epoxy droplets were sheared off the fiber at a rate of 5 Âµm/second using a custommade microvise. To grip the epoxy droplet, an adjustable micrometer equipped with shearing plates was used. The shearing plates were first brought into contact with both sides of the fiber and then opened slightly to let the fiber, but not the droplet, move between them. A video camera and monitor were used to improve the resolution during this procedure. The microvise was used to translate the fiber and droplet horizontally using a motorized stage. As the shearing plates moved vertically along the fiber, they make full contact with the droplet and an axial force, detected by the balance, is exerted on the droplet. The axial force on the droplet is then transferred to the fiber through a shearing force at the fiber-matrix interface. When the shearing force exceeds the interfacial bond strength, detachment occurs. The data was transmitted from the balance to a computer at a speed of 6 force readings/second. The maximum force read from the computer is taken as the point at which the droplet has debonded from the fiber. Equation (2.1) was used to calculate interfacial adhesion strength.\n\nTransverse tensile strength is a simple and quick alternative to qualitatively evaluate the fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion. The experiments were conducted by strictly following ASTM test method D3039/D3039M. In this case, a thin flat strip of the composite laminate specimen having a constant rectangular cross-section was mounted in the grips of a universal testing machine (Instron model 1137) and monotonically loaded in tension with the loading direction perpendicular to the fiber longitudinal direction. The load was recorded by the load cell of the testing machine. The ultimate tensile strength of the material was determined from dividing the maximum load carried prior to failure by the cross-sectional area. It is obvious that stronger interface provides a higher transverse tensile strength as long as the observed failure occurs at the fiber-matrix interface. If matrix failure is found, the data will not reflect the nature of the interface and are not valid.\n\nA schematic of the optical setup designed to measure the deflection and vibration dynamics of a cantilever beam is shown in where n is the number of cycles of the vibration, A 0 is the amplitude of the first vibration, and A n is amplitude of the n th vibration. The term ln( / ) A A n n 0 , also known as the logarithmic decrement d, is proportional to another damping factor Î¶ (Equation (2.15)). It can be obtained by fitting the experimental data to the following equation [29] to determine Î¶ :\n\nwhere B 0 , and B 1 are constants.\n\nMeasurements of vibration damping are complicated by the fact that tan Î´ usually is a function of the amplitude of the vibration. However, it appears that for small amplitudes, tan Î´ is reasonably constant [27].\n\nThe interfacial adhesion was evaluated for both single-fiber and multi-fiber reinforced polymer composites with different techniques, i.e., microbond pull-out tests, transverse tensile strength measurements and vibration damping techniques. The experimental results are summarized as follows. Note that the values presented in all of the tables are the average measurements from at least five specimens unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe interfacial adhesion strength measurements obtained from the microbond single fiber (wire) pull-out tests are summarized in Table 4.1. For all of the metallic wire reinforced polymer composites used in the current study, the wires were not only supplied in as-received condition, but also coated with silicone mold release to create a weak wire-matrix interface. The measurements show clearly that all silicone mold release coated wires exhibit lower interfacial adhesion strengths. The experimental values listed in Table 4.1 are averages obtained from at least twenty microbond specimens.\n\nFigure 4.1 shows a typical example of the vibration damping curve of a single glass fiber reinforced composite sample, which was obtained from the optical system described in Section 3.4. The value of tan Î´ was found to be 39 8 10 3 . Ã -which is typical for this material system at the fixed resonant frequency. Other experimental results are summarized in Table 4.2.\n\nData in Table 4.3 represent the transverse tensile strength of the composite laminates used in the current study. Figure 4.2 is the similar curve as Figure 4.1, but was obtained from a composite laminate specimen with 61% volume fraction of non-surface-treated E-glass fibers (designated as Type A specimen). The value of tan Î´ was found to be 381 10 3 .

The rest of data are listed in Table 4.4.\n\nIt is important to note from Tables 4.1 through 4.4 that the overall vibration damping characteristics and resonant frequencies of the tested specimens depend on sample dimensions. It can be seen that there is no obvious relationship between the overall damping factor of the composites and the interfacial adhesion strength. Therefore, it is necessary to separate the contribution of energy dissipation from the component materials and the interface to determine the correspondence of the interfacial damping and interfacial adhesion strength. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Equation (2.18) can be used for this purpose. However, prior to applying Equation (2.18) to calculate the interfacial damping contribution, it is necessary to know the values of certain parameters including the Young's modulus of the composites, and the Young's moduli and tan Î´ for each component. In the current study, some values were obtained by experiment, while some data were obtained from the literature.\n\nFrom the Bernoulli-Euler beam equation [29,60,61], it can be shown that the Young's modulus, E, of the material is related to its frequency of vibration. The equation used for calculating E for a beam specimen is as follows [29]:\n\n1875 2 4 4 2 ÏÏ . (4.1)\n\nwhere Ï r is the resonant frequency of the first mode of vibration, L and h are the length and the thickness of the beam, and Ï is the beam density. The density of the epoxy resin is reported from 1.115 g/cm 3 [62] to 1.25 g/cm 3 [63]. In the current study, the former value was used for the Epon 828 epoxy resin which was used to make single fiber (wire) reinforced epoxy composite specimens. For the E-glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminates provided by Owens\n\nCorning Science & Technology Center (Granville, OH), the latter value was used for the epoxy density. Rule of mixtures (ROM) was utilized to obtain the beam density for all composite beams.\n\nIt has been reported that the damping factor also varies with frequency [48,64]. By changing the beam length, an identical natural frequency (or resonant frequency) was obtained for the single component materials, which was comparable to the frequencies of the tested composites.

Note that the data for single glass fiber were borrowed from the E-glass values [48] which have been reported not to change much for various kinds of glasses. The average values of the data listed in Tables 4.5 and 4.6 were used to calculate tan Î´ in based on Equation (2.18). The results are given in Tables 4.7 and 4.8.\n\nThe variation of interfacial damping factor tan Î´ in with the change of volume fraction of E-glass fibers V f is plotted in Figure 4.3. It is evident that tan Î´ in increases with increasing of V f for each type of E-glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate. As the volume fraction of glass fibers in the composites increase, more fiber-matrix interfacial area is created, and the more energy can be dissipated by the fiber-matrix interface.\n\nWhen comparing values of tan Î´ in listed in Table 4.7 with the measured interfacial adhesion strength Ï measure shown in Table 4.1, it can be recognized immediately that there is an inverse relationship between the two parameters (refer to Figure 4.4).\n\nIt is shown that the transverse tensile strength Ï tr is usually proportional to Ï [65]. The transverse tensile strength Ï tr thus can be used to qualitatively evaluate the fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion.

This interfacial damping factor was reported by Zorowski and Murayama [14], and is described in Chapter 2 (Equation 2.18); a modified rule of mixtures (ROM) equation was applied to obtain the damping factor for ideal (strong) interfacial bonding (Equation 2.18b). This equation has been used throughout the current research and thus it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of it.\n\nEquation 2.18b can be derived using many different approaches. One of them involves in a simple and basic method described as follows.\n\nIt was noted in Section 2. where Ï 0 is the natural frequency, the equation of motion can then be written as\n\nThe solution to which is given as Equation (2.4).\n\nThis model can be extended to a two element spring-mass-dashpot system if two component materials are adhered with a perfect bond and vibrated at the same natural frequency.\n\nThe system and the free-body diagram, in this case, are illustrated in Figures 5.\n\n3 and 5.4, respectively.\n\nIf it is assumed that the combined spring-mass-dashpot system obeys the rule of mixtures (ROM), the differential equation for vibration damping then becomes\n\nassuming that the volume fractions of the two component materials in the system are V 1 and V 2 , respectively. Equation ( 5.3) can also be written in the following form:\n\nwhere Ï 0\n\nBy reorganizing the expression of Î¶ c , and knowing that k V k V k c = + 1 1 2 2 , Î¶ c can be rewritten as:\n\nTherefore,  â â â â 2 2 x t ( It is known that the spring constant k and Young's modulus E are proportional to each other. For a cantilever beam, the correlation between k and E is [27]:\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the beam and L is the beam length. It has been suggested that damping factor Î¶ and tan Î´ also be proportional to each other [25,27], which can be seen from Equation (2.15). Thus, it is concluded that Equations (2.18b) and (5.5) are identical. Equation (2.18b) can also be proven through definition of complex modulus, which is presented in Appendix A.\n\nIt has been emphasized that when fiber-matrix interfacial bond is not ideal, the interfacial energy dissipation should be taken into account, and the system will become more complicated, as schematically shown in Figure 5.5. It is not easy to completely solve this problem due to its complexity. However, it is reasonable to use the idea proposed by Zorowski and Murayama [14] or Equation (2.18) to view the interfacial damping as the total damping contributed from the composite material minus that contributed from each component material.\n\nIt is known that if the bond between the matrix and the reinforcement of a composite material is broken, the interface will dissipate energy when the composite is under vibration [49,50]. The damping contributed from interfaces can be attributed to two mechanisms, i.e., interfacial slip or Coulomb friction which relates to interfacial energy dissipation from the already broken interface, and by interfacial debonding or cracking which corresponds to the newly created interfacial debonding during vibration. Zorowski and Murayama [14] analyzed the former mechanism and derived a proportional relationship between interfacial damping and the volume fraction of the components in a unidirectional fiber reinforced composite. However, it can be envisioned that the latter mechanism should dissipate more energy, as compared to the former. Therefore, if both mechanisms are involved in the interfacial damping, the latter mechanism will dominate. The following micromechanics model is thus derived according to this argument to see whether or not an inverse relationship between interfacial damping and interfacial adhesion strength holds, as experimentally found and stated in Chapter 4. A schematic diagram of the model used to theoretically analyze the interfacial dissipative mechanism is depicted in Figure 5.6. A single fiber of constant cross section and properties is embedded in a matrix of lower modulus and of length equal to that of the fiber. Only loads parallel to the fiber axis are considered.\n\nBased on the theory presented by Outwater Jr. [66], the analysis starts with the calculation of stress distribution in the fiber when it is axially loaded. For a partially debonded fiber, the mechanism that keeps the composite intact can be represented by the radial pressure surrounding and acting on the fiber, p. Any relative movement between the matrix and the fiber is resisted by the longitudinal component of this radial pressure. The free body diagram is shown in Figure 5.7.\n\nBy balancing the forces acted on the segment, the following equation can be obtained:\n\nwhere F f is the force acting at the fiber, r f is the fiber radius and Âµ is the friction coefficient between fiber and matrix.\n\nSimilarly, if the force F f can cause interfacial debonding, then Âµ p in Equation (5.7a) can be replaced by the interfacial shear strength of the composite, Ï , which is that necessary to pull the fiber from the matrix. The equation then becomes\n\nEquations (5.7a) and (5.7b) represent Coulomb friction and interfacial debonding caused by F f , respectively. Note that in both cases, F f is assumed to be constant which is reasonable for small friction or debonding region. The total effect is the superposition of the two equations.\n\nHowever, as just mentioned in the previous section, when both mechanisms are involved in the interfacial damping, the latter mechanism will dominate because more energy is dissipated.\n\nTherefore, the energy dissipation part in Equation (5.7a) can be ignored and the energy consideration can be focused on the force balance in Equation (5.7b). By rearranging Equation This equation can be easily solved to give solution F r x f f = 2Ï Ï (5.9)\n\nEquation (5.9) is identical to Equation (2.1) in which debonding force was defined as F d .\n\nAccording to Equation (5.9), the debonding region can be estimated as:\n\nThe maximum debonding region is caused by the maximum load on fiber F f max when an alternating load is applied to the composite, which is true in the case of vibration,\n\nFor a cantilever beam, if there is interfacial debonding, it usually occurs at the free end of the beam because shear strain (and stress) is high at that location [67]. In this case, the force balance is shown in Figure 5.8.\n\nForces F f and F f max can be found from bending load P of a cantilever beam as shown in F F P P P L E I f c c = = â = sinÎ¸ Î¸ 0 0 2 2 2 (5.11)\n\nwhere I c is the moment of inertia of the composite beam. Therefore, the maximum load carried by fiber, F f max , which corresponds to the maximum bending load, P max ,, can be expressed quantitatively as\n\nProvided the energy dissipation in a cycle âW is small compared with the maximum stored elastic energy W of the system, which is true for most vibration damping situations, the loss coefficient Î· , or tan Î´ in , may be estimated by Equation (2.15).\n\nAssuming the stress in the fiber gradually approaches the maximum value (or P gradually reaches to P max ,) during a vibration cycle, interfacial debonding and slippage between fiber and  matrix will dissipate energy. Since the integration is performed over a complete cycle about the origin, the energy dissipated per cycle is given by âW F x f = 2 0 max (5.13) Substituting Equations (5.10b) and (5.12) into Equation (5.13) yields âW P L E I P L E I r P L r E I c c c c f f c c = = 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 max max max ( ) Ï Ï Ï Ï (5.14)\n\nThe potential energy W for a sample subjected to strain Îµ can be calculated as follows ( ) (5.17)\n\nFor the vibration of a cantilever beam, E c can be calculated according to the vibration theory\n\n4 4 2 4 4 2 1875 12 1875 . ( ) . (5.18)\n\nwhere Ï c is the resonant frequency at the first mode of vibration, m c is the mass of the composite per unit length, and Ï is the density.\n\nSubstituting Equation (5.18) into Equation (5.17) we obtain, after rearranging\n\nwhere B = Ã 75 16 1875 4 2  . Ï Equation (5.19) clearly shows the inverse relationship between tan Î´ in and Ï , which is as expected.\n\nThere is another issue that should be clarified. It has been mentioned in Chapter 2 that when a cantilever beam is excited by a pre-displacement, the beam is vibrated with a frequency which is primarily composed of its first mode of vibration, and the response is the linear combination of all of the modes because it is not vibrated with an exact resonant frequency. In a related experiment, it has been found that the first mode of vibration is dominating for a cantilever beam vibration [69]. It is thus reasonable to use the first mode of vibration in the model derivation.\n\nIt is now appropriate to apply Equation (5.19) to the experimental results. However, before this occurs, it is necessary to verify the key assumption made in the derivation of the model, i.e., that interfacial debonding occurs during vibration. An empirical relationship between debonding length as a function of number of cycles was developed as a means to experimentally verify this assumption. According to the derived model, the debonded interfacial region of the composite after each run of vibration with a certain predisplacement is estimated to be approximate 1 to 2 Âµm. Therefore, the total debonded length after vibration for about 100 times should be around 0.1 to 0.2 mm assuming that the same debonding length is obtained for each run. Several samples were used to examine this effect. Figure 5.10 clearly shows the debonding crack at the free end of a single molybdenum wire reinforced epoxy composite cantilever beam.\n\nThe morphology of the crack is similar to that of debonded microbond samples which were also observed using the microscope for comparison. However, these observations are not conclusive.\n\nIn fact, it has been found that it is difficult to observe cracks such as those shown in Figure 5.10 when simply doing vibration on single fiber (wire) reinforced composite samples. The cracks could be only observed in approximately 20% of the samples tested. Meanwhile, it brings out another question, i.e., whether the observed crack was initiated by bending the cantilever beam (it happened in the process of setting the predisplacement of the beam) or whether it was caused by the vibration process afterwards. Unfortunately, as just mentioned above, it is difficult to find a crack in single wire samples, and it is hard to distinguish the two process with a single specimen.\n\nTo further verify the assumption that there is interfacial debonding during vibration, sandwich cantilever beam specimens consists of two pieces of polyethylene plate glued with double sided transparent tape were fabricated. Three sandwich specimens were prepared and pressed under a uniform weight for 36 hours. One of the specimens was then used as a control sample which was not tested any further. The second specimen was manually bent twenty times without vibration.\n\nThe third, however, was mechanically vibrated twenty times after having been subjected to the same bending displacement as the second specimen. The free end of all cantilever beam specimens were observed under a microscope, and the micrographs of the three specimens are shown in Figure 5.11. The debonding cracks can be clearly viewed from the optical interference patterns. Note that it is difficult to find a crack in the control sample, and the specimen subjected to the vibrations exhibits the longest debonding crack. This is an indirect evidence that the model can indeed be applied to predict the interfacial adhesion strength.\n\nAfter applying the model derived above, the interfacial adhesion strength can be calculated from interfacial damping value tan Î´ in according to Equation (5.19). For the single fiber (wire) reinforced epoxy composites used in the current study, the number of debonded fibers n is simply equal to 1. By utilizing the necessary data listed in Tables 4.

According to the illustration made by Drzal [74], this interphase includes not only the region of contact between fiber and matrix (the interface) but also a region on both sides of the interface. The local properties start to change from the bulk properties in the direction of the interface. In this region, chemical and morphological features are different from the component materials. Meanwhile, impurities, unreacted polymer components, non-polymerized matrix additives, voids, and adsorbed gasses can also be found in the interphase. The resultant interphase thus can be a very complex material which can not easily be analyzed by a single parameter models. Therefore, more complicated micromechanics model may need to be taken into account, which will include the interphase to form a three phase model. This will be more realistic for real composites in which sizing and silane are usually applied to modify the interfacial adhesion and may form many interphase regions.\n\nFor E-glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminates, it is difficult to detect the number of debonded fibers, n, after failure. Equation (5.19), therefore, can not be directly applied to predict the interfacial adhesion strength at the present time. However, the inverse relationship between energy loss from the interface, tan Î´ in , and interfacial adhesion strength, Ï should still hold. This relationship should be true even if there is no instant debonding occurring during the vibration because more energy dissipation from the interface will reflect weak interfacial slippage.\n\nEquation (2.18) shows that a higher value of tan Î´ in reflects poor adhesion in the system.\n\nResults shown in Figures 4.5 This can be explained as follows. If a composite specimen has 30% volume fraction of E-glass fibers, there is large amount of epoxy resin in the composite. When transverse tensile strength tests were conducted, the failure usually occurred in the matrix material, not at the fiber-matrix interface. In this case, therefore, the measured values of Ï tr represent indeed the tensile yield strength of the matrix material or the epoxy resin. It is thus even more interesting to note that the vibration damping method is more sensitive to the fiber-matrix interface, and is likely to be a more promising technique to detect the fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion.\n\nIt is known that composites with poor interfacial bonding exhibit a low interfacial adhesion strength, Ï . It can easily be seen from results stated above that the observations from tan Î´ in are consistent with the results from Ï , and both show the same magnitude of the interfacial bonding.\n\nIn other words, tan Î´ in and Ï show a strong inverse correlation. Some experimental data have been presented and published in the conference and technical journal [75,76]. It has been shown that this relation is still valid when the interface is affected by moisture (refer to Appendix B).\n\nSamples with untreated fibers show the weakest interfacial adhesion among all samples. The experimental results showed that an inverse relationship between damping characteristics of the fiber-matrix interface and transverse tensile strength of composite laminates is also valid.\n\nIn conclusion, it has been shown that an inverse relationship exists between interfacial damping factor and interfacial adhesion strength for uniaxial fiber-reinforced polymer composites.\n\nThe interfacial damping factor, therefore, can be used as a parameter to characterize the fibermatrix adhesion of the composites.\n\nThe future work is suggested to complete the micromechanics model by considering more complicated situation, such as interphase and combination of interfacial slippage and crack growth during the vibration. More environmental experiments are also suggested.\n\nAssuming that the complex modulus of a composite obeys rule of mixtures (ROM). i.e.,\n\nAccording to definition, Equation (A.1) can be rewritten as:\n\nBy separating the real part and imaginary part from Equation (A.2), the following expression can be reached.\n\nAccording to the definition of tan Î´ , the following derivation should hold. It is easy to directly obtain the damping factor or loss tangent (tan Î´ ) from Equation (3.1) or by curve fitting using Equation (3.2). However, in the case of the abnormal curve illustrated in Figure B.3 which presents several \"loops\" with \"peaks\" and \"valleys\", it is questionable to select which data to calculate tan Î´ although the overall exponential decay can still be recognized in the curve. In the current study, the \"peak\" data in each \"loop\" were chosen to fit the decay curve.\n\n* The American Society for Testing Materials, under classification of Cased Copper-Base Alloys (B 119), classifies these alloys as having additions of over 10 percent of zinc, nickel in amounts sufficient to give white color, and lead under 0.5 percent."
