    "abstract": "Photonic crystals are nano-structures exhibiting the interesting behavior that light at certain frequencies cannot travel in the crystal, whereas at other frequencies it does travel and is scattered. This phenomenon is due to the periodic variation in the index of refraction of the crystal [17],\n[8]\n.\nSuch crystals also have the property that light at an allowed frequency may travel along a particular path, as a consequence of a small non-periodic variation (impurity) in the refractive index. The role of mathematics is crucial to the solution of several problems involving nano-structures. In particular, the design of photonic crystals is based on the identification of the refractive index of crystals when the allowed and forbidden frequencies are specified.\nThe purpose of this paper is to derive physically relevant mathematical results on the design of photonic crystals.\nThe outline of the paper is the following: in Section 2 we illustrate some physical",
    "full_text": "properties, mention relevant applications and introduce the mathematical model that describes the propagation of light in photonic crystals. In Section 3 we give the basic mathematical results. In Section 4 we introduce the scattering matrix and the period map which allows us to characterize the propagation of the light in the crystal in terms of its behavior when propagating for only one period. In Section 5 we propose some new results on the design of photonic crystals and in Section 6 we draw some conclusions and mention some open problems.\n\nPhotonic crystals are mono, bi or tri-dimensional crystal lattice structures characterized by a periodic refractive indexfoot_0 n(x; y; z) (em=e 0 m 0 ) p . These crystals have many properties analogous to those of semiconductor crystals, such as the appearance of pass bands and band gaps and a complex dispersion relation [7]. Repeating the dielectric constant in a pure unbounded photonic crystal periodically generates allowed and forbidden photonic energy bands in the same way as the periodic potential in a semiconductor crystal affects the electron motion by defining allowed and forbidden electronic energy bands. Forbidden bands in photonic crystals are called photonic band gaps or PBGs. In Figure 1 we show a typical band structure.\n\nReplacing the material in a bounded region by a different material or changing the size of a period while keeping the same material, we can put the (discrete) energies of allowed states into a band gap (crossed dots in Figure 1). Besides the band gap structure, another analogy is between polarization and spin. The two orthogonal polarizations for photons are analogous to the two electron spins [7]. On the other hand, electrons have mass and charge while photons have neither mass nor change. Moreover, electrons follow the Fermi-Dirac distribution, whereas photons obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n\nThe band gap structure allows us to design resonant cavities [7], [5], [6], waveguides [7], [5], [6] and optical fibers [2]. Introducing impurities we can either confine light (resonant cavity) or light can be guided in the crystal by using impurities to create preferred pathways.\n\nPhotonic crystals can also be used to design next generation optical fibers. Standard optical fibers rely on light being guided by the physical law known as total internal reflection (TIR) or index guiding. In order to achieve TIR in these fibers, which are formed from dielectrics or semiconductors, it is required that the refractive index of the core exceeds that of the surrounding media. In photonic crystal fibers light is confined to propagating along PBGs, while the core can be a different medium with a small index of refraction. These fibers have properties that differ from those of standard fibers: they allow bending by large angles and soliton propagation, both of which are very important to telecommunication.\n\nPhotonic crystals are also characterized by seemingly strange properties like negative refraction, negative diffraction and the superprism effect [10], [12] typical Fig. 1. The band gap structure of a photonic crystal. The band gaps are plotted in light grey while crossed dots are allowed energy levels introduced by an impurity. The axis units are arbitrary. [3] MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS of a left-handed metamaterial. As to the first property, we can say that ``Snell's law is reversed.'' As a matter of fact, in photonic crystals, for certain frequency intervals, the rays will be refracted on the same side of the normal upon entering the material. Negative diffraction is another unusual phenomenon: the luminous cone collimates inside photonic crystals unlike what occurs at ordinary diffraction. Finally, photonic crystals are characterized by a high dispersion capability. A prism made up of a photonic crystal would have a dispersion capability that is about 500 times stronger than that of a prism made of a conventional material [9]. Using these properties (negative refraction, negative diffraction and superprism) a research group at the Georgia Institute of Technology has designed an optical de-multiplexer [13].\n\nNonlinear optics also plays an important role in this kind of crystal. Some of the most interesting nonlinear phenomena are second and third harmonics generation (SHG and THG), optical parametric amplification (OPA), optical rectification and white-light supercontinuum generation (WLSCG).\n\nIn a linear medium the dielectric polarization vector P(r; t) can be written as P(r; t) e 0 x e (r; t)E(r; t);\n\nwhere r is the position in space, t is the time, while e 0 is the electric permittivity of free space and x e (r; t) is the electric susceptibility of the medium. 2 If the medium is nonlinear then the previous formula is not correct and the susceptibility also depends on the electric field amplitude:\n\nx (2)  i; j;k (r; t)E j (r; t)E k (r; t) . . . for i, j, k 1, 2, 3, where the different x's are electric susceptibilities. Exciting a medium with two electromagnetic waves with different frequencies v 1 and v 2 , the dielectric polarization vector becomes\n\nAccording to this we can generate light with a double or triple frequency (SHG or THG) and amplify a signal input in the presence of a higher-frequency wave (OPA). It is also possible to generate quasi-static electric fields or to produce an optical spectrum which covers all of the visible range (WLSCG). This last property is commonly used for spectroscopic purposes to produce a very broad spectrum of light starting from an initially spectrally much narrower light pulse (a few tenths of a nanometer or less).\n\nAnother important nonlinear phenomenon is the Kerr effect, according to which the refractive index depends on the electromagnetic amplitude, i.e., n n(jEj):\n\nThe Kerr effect is used to design optical transistors [18] that are the basic components of integrated optics. Research in photonic crystals is also enhanced by low energy loss (50cm À1 2dB=100mm, [5]).\n\nOur mathematical model generalizes both the Schro Èdinger equation, which describes electron propagation in a semiconductor crystal, and the Maxwell and Helmholtz equations, which describe electromagnetic wave propagation. A mathematical model capable of merging both models is the following: Àc HH (l; x) Q(x)c(l; x) ln(x) 2 c(l; x); 2:1 where Q(x p) Q(x), n(x p) n(x) and p is the period. Here Q(x) is the potential energy and n(x) is the refractive index. This approach allows us to extend the quantum mechanical postulates to describe light propagation rather than to adopt a classical model like the Helmholtz equation. In fact, 1. each eigenfunction furnishes an allowed state; 2. the state of a quantum mechanical system is completely specified by the wavefunction;\n\n3. the squared absolute value of the wavefunction jc(l; x)j 2 is proportional to the probability to find a particle within an infinitesimal interval centered at x.\n\nWe can use quantum mechanical operators to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction.\n\nThe Schro Èdinger equation 3 for electrons and the Helmholtz 4 equation for photons\n\nand p is the period. 4 Àc HH (l; x) ln(x) 2 c(l; x); with n(x p) n(x) and p is the period.\n\n[5]\n\nMATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS in a crystal are both eigenvalue equations. Though very similar, the physical meaning of the eigenvalue l is very different. We can appreciate the difference by considering two examples: electrons in free space (Q(x) 0) and photons in an optically homogeneous medium (n(x) const). In these cases we have\n\nwhere l is the eigenvalue parameter of the equations. We observe that in the first case the eigenvalue parameter l is proportional to the electron energy, whereas in the second case the eigenvalue parameter is proportional to the square of the energy.\n\nIn this work we introduce the period map as a matrix operator that allows us to obtain the solution at any location in the crystal by analysing only one period. Our primary purpose is to calculate the refractive index from the left and right reflection and transmission coefficients, which is a typical inverse problem. To do so, we introduce the scattering matrix, that is the matrix uniquely characterized by the reflection and transmission coefficients, and then divide this inverse problem into the following two subproblems:\n\n1. determining the period map from the scattering matrix; 2. determining the refractive index from the period map.\n\nIn particular, we analyse the piecewise-constant case for the refractive index n(x) in a mono-dimensional crystal and consider the impurities confined to an interval of length less than a crystal period.\n\nIn the following subsections we consider equation (2.1) determine its solution and analyse the case of a crystal without impurities.\n\nLet us first derive Floquet's theorem ([15, Ch. XXI] and [11], [3]) and Hill's discriminant. There exist unique linearly independent solutions u(l; x) and f(l; x) of equation ( 2.1) satisfying the initial conditions ul; 0 1; u H l; 0 0; (3:1a) fl; 0 0; f H l; 0 1: (3:1b) Let c(x) T 0 be a solution of equation (2.1) satisfying the t-periodicity or Born-Von Ka Ârma Ân's condition c(l; x p) tc(l; x); 3:2 where t is a constant. Since c P C 1 , by substituting x 0 in (3.2) and its x-derivative we have c(l; p) tc(l; 0); (3:3a) c H (l; p) tc H (l; 0); (3:3b) for some constants 0 T t P C. Obviously c(l; x) is a linear combination of u(l; x) and f(l; x): c(l; x) c 1 u(l; x) c 2 f(l; x): This linear combination satisfies the boundary conditions (3.3) if and only if the linear system t À u(l; p) Àf(l; p) Àu H (l; p) t À f H (l; p) c 1 c 2 0 0 has a nontrivial solution. This is the case if and only if the system determinant t 2 À [u(l; p) f H (l; p)]t 1 3:4\n\nvanishes. Here we have used the constancy of the Wronskian 5 w uf H À u H f and condition (3.1). Introducing Hill's discriminant D(l) u(l; p) f H (l; p); 3:5 5 Using equation (2.1) we easily show that\n\nTo be more precise, w(x) const: w(0). From conditions (3.1) it follows that w(x) 1.\n\n[7]\n\nMATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS we have t 2 À D(l)t 1 0 3:6 as well as\n\nwhere t 1 and t 2 are the roots of equation (3.6). Generalizing Born-Von Ka Ârma Ân's condition to m periods we get: c(l; x mp) t m c(l; x):\n\nWhen nontrivial, such solutions are unbounded as x 3 I if jtj > 1 and as x 3 À I if jtj < 1. Thus boundedness of such nontrivial solutions requires jtj 1, so t 1 e ikp and t 2 e Àikp with k P R. Hill's discriminant becomes\n\n1 e ikp e Àikp 2 cos (kp): 3:7\n\nHence we have bounded solutions if and only if D(l) is in [ À 2 ; 2]. For such values of l a bounded solution exists and hence an electromagnetic wave can propagate inside the crystal. Outside this range there is no physical solution, because these waves, which are called unbounded solutions, would have infinite energy. By the Schro Èdinger-Helmholtz Spectrum, denoted by fsg, we mean the set of l values such that c(l; x) is bounded in x P R.\n\nThe natural extension of a solution of equation (2.1) has the Bloch representation c(l; x) e ikx x(l; x); 3:8 where x(l; x) is periodic with period p. This is easily verified by checking the periodicity of e Àikx c(l; x). We observe that k can be interpreted as a propagation vector of Bloch's wave. Generalizing Firsova's formula [4], defined for n(x) 1, we can write k as followsfoot_2 k(l)\n\nand state Floquet's Theorem [11] in terms of k k(l) and l.\n\nT h e o re m 3 . 1 [Floquet]. If the roots t 1 and t 2 of the quadratic polynomial (3.4) are distinct, then equation (2.1) has two linearly independent solutions of the type e ikx x 1 (l; x) and e Àikx x 2 (l; x); where x 1 (l; x) and x 2 (l; x) are both periodic with period p. If t 1 t 2 , then equation (2.1) has a nontrivial periodic solution (t 1 t 2 1) or an antiperiodic solution (t 1 t 2 À1). Let x(x) denote such a solution and let f(x) be another solution that is linearly independent of x(x). Then there exists a constant w such that f(x p) t 1 f(x) wx(x), while w 0 is equivalent to u(l; p) f H (l; p) AE 1 and f(l; p) u H (l; p) 0:\n\nFurther, the solutions of equation (2.1) are all bounded if and only if\n\nWe can calculate t as a function of l from equation (3.6),\n\nAssuming l = P fsg, let us set t 1 (l) and t 2 (l) such as jt 1 (l)j < 1 and jt 2 (l)j > 1;\n\nthen for any l with D(l) = P [ À 2; 2]\n\nwhere the square root is positive. If l P fsg we can write\n\nwhere the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. Recalling that t 1 (l) e ikp and t 2 (l) e Àikp ; 3:12 we have k P R; D(l) P [ À 2; 2] or equivalently l P fsg; 2] or equivalently l = P fsg:\n\n(\n\nHereafter in the paper we shall assume Imfkg ! 0 if D(l) = P [ À 2; 2]. [9] MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS\n\nProposition 3.2. Given the following eigenvalue problem:\n\nand n(x) are real functions, then l is real for every t such that jtj 1.\n\nP r o of . Multiplying equation (2.1) by c Ã (l; x) and integrating the resulting equation from 0 to p we obtain:\n\nfrom which we can derive\n\nn(x) 2 ; 3:15 which tends to I. For jtj 1 and t T AE 1 these eigenvalues are simple, while for t AE 1 they have multiplicity one or two. The eigenvalue l Ã can only occur if the corresponding eigenfunction is constant, Q(x) l Ã n(x) 2 , and the boundary conditions are periodic. P r o of . For a noneigenvalue l 0 P R, let f (x) be an electromagnetic pulse, so that the right hand side of equation (2.1) is ln(x) 2 [c(l; x) f (x)]. In this case equation (2.1) with boundary conditions (3.3) (see Appendix A) can be written as the equivalent integral equation c(l; x) À (l À l 0 ) p 0 q(x; y; l 0 )n(y) 2 c(l; y) dy p 0 q(x; y; l 0 )n(y) 2 f (y) dy; 3:16 where q(x; y; l) is the associated Green's function. In this integral equation the Green's function kernel q(x; y; l) has the form q(x; y; l)\n\nwhere ff j g is an orthonormal basis of L 2 ((0; p); n(x) 2 dx) consisting of eigenfunctions corresponding to (real) eigenvalues fl (j) g. The summation is finite for degenerate kernels and infinite for nondegenerate kernels. Since q(x; y; l) cannot be C 1 in (x; y) [because this would contradict relation (A.9)], the summation and hence the number of eigenvalues must be infinite. Furthermore, from (3.14) it follows that the eigenvalues l are real, satisfy l ! l Ã with l Ã as in (3.15), and can only coincide with l Ã if the eigenfunction is constant, Q(x) l Ã n(x) 2 , and the boundary conditions are periodic. Thus there exist two infinite sequences, one of eigenvalues\n\nunder periodic boundary conditions and the other one of eigenvalues\n\nunder anti-periodic boundary conditions. For t T 1 there also exists an infinite sequence of eigenvalues\n\nunder the boundary conditions (3.3). The multiplicity of an eigenvalue is at most 2, because the differential equation (2.1) has order 2. For t T AE 1 the multiplicity is always one, because the eigenvalues l follow from (3.6), so that one differential equation has both a t-periodic and a t À1 -periodic solution. p\n\nNow we state the following important theorem concerning a very important relation between the eigenvalues fl i g and fm i g [11]:\n\nT h e o re m 3 .4 [Oscillation theorem]. To each differential equation (2.1) we associate two monotonically increasing infinite sequences of real numbers fl n g I n0 and fm n g I n1 such that equation (2.1) has a solution of period p if and only if l l n (n 0; 1; 2; . . .) and a solution of primitive period 2p if, and only if, l m n (n 1; 2; 3; . . .). These sequences satisfy the inequalities\n\n3:17 and the relations lim n3I l n I; lim n3I m n I: 3:18\n\nThe solutions are all bounded for l in the intervals (l 0 ; m 1 ); (m 2 ; l 1 ); (l 2 ; m 3 ); (m 4 ; l 3 ); . . . :\n\nFor l at the endpoints of these intervals (and always for l l 0 ) there exist unbounded solutions. The solutions are all bounded for l l 2n1 or l l 2n2 if and only if l 2n1 l 2n2 and they are all bounded for l m 2n1 or l m 2n2 if and only if m 2n1 m 2n2 . The numbers l n are the zeros of D(l) 2 and the numbers m n are the zeros of D(l) À 2.\n\nWe call l n the characteristic values of the first kind and m n the characteristic values of the second kind. The intervals in (3.19) are called bands. We consider an endpoint as belonging to a band if for that value of l all solutions of equation (2.1) are bounded. The gaps between the stability intervals are called band gaps, one of which is the zero-th band gap ( À I; l 0 ]. The bands are numbered consecutively 1; 2; 3; . . . and may line up. The band gaps are numbered consecutively 0; 1; 2; . . . and may be empty.\n\nIn the previous section, we showed that analysis of Hill's discriminant permits us to calculate the bands. We report the same important results about Hill's discriminant without proof [11]. First of all we extend D(l) to the complex l-plane which we indicate by L. More precisely we mention the following properties:\n\n(a) D(l) 3 I if l P R and l 3 À I;\n\n(b) in each band-gap, excluding band-gap 0, there is a unique relative maximum or a unique relative minimum fj i g: (j i P band-gap i, i ! 1). If a band-gap is empty and D(j i ) is a relative maximum then j i l iÀ1 l i ; conversely if a band-gap is empty and D(j i ) is a relative minimum then D(j i ) À2 and j i m i m i1 ;\n\n(c) the function D(l) is strictly decreasing in band-gap 0 and strictly increasing between a relative minimum and a relative maximum, while it is strictly increasing between a relative minimum and a relative maximum.\n\nIf l P L n fsg, the solution c(l; x) is unbounded as x 3 I or as x 3 À I, while it is bounded for any x if, and only if, l P fsg.\n\nLet us consider the L plane, we call G i -curve [4] the i-th curve in the complex plane L n R where Hill's discriminant is real. The G i -curve crosses the real axis in j i and approaches the vertical asymptote Realflg (ip) 2 , where i 1; 2; :::. Then Hill's discriminant is real if l P R or if l belong to G-curve, where G-curve denotes the set of all G i -curves.\n\nLet us now consider a photonic crystal with impurities, where both Q(x) and n(x) have a periodic component and a component describing the effect of impurities. In this case we have the equation 2 [1 e(x)]c(l; x); 4:1 where Q 0 (x) and n 0 (x) are assumed to be real piecewise continuous periodic functions Fig. 2. L plane. The real axis and the G-curve are plotted in light grey. The vertical asymptotes, Realflg (ip) 2 , where i 1; 2; :::, are plotted in black. [13] MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN PHOTONIC CRYSTALS of period p, e(x) is piecewise continuous and vanishes as x 3 AE I, the lower bound inffe(x) : x P Rg > À 1 and Q i (x) is a Faddeev class potential (i.e., Q i (x) is real and satisfies I ÀI (1 jxj)jQ i (x)j dx < I). We also assume that\n\nIn this context the Jost functions f 1;2 play a very important role. Indeed, the Jost functions are needed to describe the asymptotic scattering effect and must coincide with appropriate t 1;2 -periodic solutions c 1;2 for large jxj if the impurity is confined to a bounded region. To analyse these solutions let us first consider the two t 1;2 Àperiodic solutions c 1;2 of (2.1) satisfying c 1 (l; 0) c 2 (l; 0) 1. Then\n\nwhere m 1;2 (l) are called Weyl coefficients and u(l; x) and f(l; x) are the Floquet solutions.\n\nUnlike u(l; x) and f(l; x), the functions c 1;2 (l; x) are independent of the initial conditions (3.2). The Weyl coefficients can be calculated by considering the Born-Von Ka Ârma Ân condition in the form\n\n0 0\n\nt 1;2 À u(l; p) f(l; p) ; 4:4 where t 1;2 are defined by equations (3.10) and (3.12). The solutions c 1;2 can be written according to Bloch's description: c 1;2 (k; x) e AE ikx x 1;2 (l; x): 4:5\n\nRecalling that for l P C n fsg we have Imfkg ! 0 and that x 1;2 are periodic functions, we can easily prove that c 1 (l; x) diverges as x À3 À I and c 2 (l; x) diverges as x À3 I. Thus if l P C n fsg we have c 1 P L 2 (R ) and c 2 P L 2 (R À ), that is:\n\nIn the next part we shall consider all functions to depend on k instead of l, according to formula (3.9). If we consider functions depending on k we can interpret solutions of equations (2.1) and (4.1) as waves.\n\nSince the Jost functions are solutions that must converge to 0 as x 3 AE I, we can set\n\nTo calculate the Jost functions we use the method of variation of parameters. To do so, let us write the Schro Èdinger-Helmholtz equation with impurities in the following way:\n\nWriting the general solution in the form c(k; x) c 1 (x)c 1 (k; x) c 2 (x)c 2 (k; x); 4:10 by the method of variation of parameters method, we obtain\n\n:\n\nIn the same way, using the condition lim x3ÀI c(k; x) c 2 (k; x); 4:14\n\nDefining by A(x; t; k) the integral kernel of the above equations, that is putting\n\nwe can write the solutions in the following way:\n\nThe Jost functions f 1;2 (k; x) satisfy conditions (4.12) and (4.14), so we can write\n\nLetting xÀ3AE I we obtain:\n\nwhere\n\nFinally, we can write all asymptotic expressions for the Jost functions (4:21a) f 1 (k; x) 9 c 1 (k; x); x 3 I;\n\nI; (4:21d) f 2 (k; x) 9 c 2 (k; x); x 3 À I: Considering equations (4.6) and equations (4.21) we can observe that f 1 (k; x) is bounded as x 3 À I if and only if a 1 (k) 0. In the same way we see that f 2 (k; x) is bounded as x 3 I if and only if a 2 (k) 0. Finally, we have bounded solutions only for the k-values that are zeros of the functions a 1 (k) and a 2 (k). These k-values are the discrete eigenvalues inserted into the band gaps by impurities.\n\nLet us consider l P C. We analyse symmetry for the principal functions depending on l. From equation (2.1), replacing l by its complex conjugate l we have Àc HH (l; x) Q(x)c(l; x) ln(x) 2 c(l; x):\n\nIf we conjugate the previous equation and recall that Q(x) and n(x) are real we have Àc HH (l; x) Q(x)c(l; x) ln(x) 2 c(l; x):\n\nis a solution of the Schro Èdinger-Helmholtz equation. Clearly we have ul; x ul; x; u H l; x u H l; x; (4:22a) fl; x fl; x; f H l; x f H l; x: (4:22b) According to equations (4.22) it is possible to derive symmetry relations for Hill's discriminant: D(l) D(l) 4:23 According to equations (3.10), if l = P fsg we have t 1 (l) t 1 (l); t 2 (l) t 2 (l); 4:24 while if l P fsg we have t 1 (l) t 2 (l): 4:25 From Firsova's formula (3.9) it is easy to prove that k(l) Àk(l): 4:26 Let us now study symmetry properties of c 1;2 (k; x). According to equations (4.22) and (4.26) we have If we consider k P R or, equally, l P fsg c 1 (l; x) u(l; x) e ik(l)p À u(l; p) f(l; p)\n\nConsidering the previous relations and equations (4.18) we can write erator W which evaluates the Wronskian of a pair of functions:\n\nWe also get for the Wronskian\n\nm 2 (l) À m 1 (l):\n\nBy the inversion and conjugation symmetries (4.27) we get\n\nWith the help of equations (4.21) we find\n\ndef a 1 (k) a 2 (k); k P C: 4:31 Using the symmetry relation (4.28) we obtain\n\nLet us now look for relations involving b 1 (k) and b 2 (k). For k P R we have\n\nAnalogously, for k P R we have Let us consider coefficients d ij (k) (i; j 1; 2) such that\n\nWriting the asymptotic expressions (x 3 AE I) for c 1;2 we get\n\nUsing that c 1;2 ( À k; x) c 2;1 (k; x) and using the linear independence of the Floquet solutions to equate coefficients of c\n\n1 (k; x) and c 2 (k; x) we get 0 d 11 k À d 12 kbÀk; 1 d 12 kak; bÀk d 11 kak; aÀk d 11 kbk d 12 k; aÀk d 21 k À d 22 kbÀk; Àbk d 22 kak; 1 d 21 kak; 0 d 21 kbk d 22 k: Therefore, d 11 (k) d 12 (k)\n\n; k P R:\n\nWe now define the transmission coefficient T(k), the reflection coefficient from the right R(k), and the reflection coefficient from the left L(k) as follows\n\nwhere k P R. Then (4.37) implies that the scattering matrix is\n\n; k P R; 4:40 that is the matrix characterizing the primary scattering parameters. According to relations (4.37), (4.39) and (4.40) we can show that S is unitary. All of these facts lead to the Riemann-Hilbert problem\n\n; k P R; 4:41 where J diag(1; À1). From (4.32), (4.36), and (4.39) we get for k P R\n\nLet us now introduce the period map, i.e. the matrix operator that allows us to obtain the solution at any location in the crystal by analysing only one period. Let us consider an unbounded mono-dimensional photonic crystal under the hypothesis of a linear, stationary, isotropic and lossless medium (n(x) P R and Q(x) 0). Let n(x) be a piecewise constant function, so that we can write n(x) n j (b jÀ1 < x < b j , j 1; . . . ; m). Here 0 b 0 < b 1 < . . . < b m p and a j b j À b jÀ1 (j 1; . . . ; m). Then any solution c j (l; x) of (3.1) on (b jÀ1 ; b j ) satisfies\n\nwhere j 1; . . . ; m. The requirement that c(l; x) is C 1 at the points b 1 ; . . . ; b mÀ1 leads to the identities\n\nor also\n\nLet A jÀ1 (l) be the matrix that links coefficients belonging to (j À 1)-th and j-th interval respectively. Then we can write\n\nOn the other hand, c(l; x) is C 1 also in p, so that setting\n\n:\n\nWe define M(l) as the period map. Since equation (2.1) is a second order linear ordinary differential equation we can write c(l; x) c 1;tot u(l; x) c 2;tot f(l; x);\n\nFrom the preceding equation we can obtain the following relationship D(l) u(l; p) f H (l; p) Tr M(l); 4:47 where Tr stands for the matrix trace. The behavior of Hill's discriminant D(l), in the particular case of a piecewise constant case with m 2, is depicted in Figure 3. Using the function D(l) we can evaluate the allowed and forbidden bands.\n\nIn the piecewise continuous case it is clear that the period map M(l) has the following property\n\nl p 0 0 1 2 3 M(l) 1 l p 0 0 1 H d I e jm;mÀ1;...;1 cos (n j a j l p ) sin (n j a j l p ) n j Àn j sin (n j a j l p ) cos (n j a j l p ) H f d I g e:\n\nWe can observe that this matrix has determinant 1 and its entries are almost periodic polynomials in l p . The diagonal entries are even real functions of l p and the offdiagonal entries are odd real functions of l p vanishing at l p 0. Let us write m j n j a j > 0 and z l p :\n\nThen we can introduce the modified period map M(z) as [25]\n\nIf we take a homogeneous medium with refractive index n 1 and consider the periodfoot_11 p M(z) cos (m j z) sin (m j z) n j\n\nÀn j sin (m j z) cos (m j z)\n\nConsidering a crystal with 2 different media with refractive indices n 1 and n 2 .\n\nRespectively, we have the following modified period map matrix\n\n:\n\nWe can now generalize the modified period map for a crystal with m different media with refractive indices n 1 , n 2 , . . ., n m , respectively, by writing\n\nc 11 s 1 ;s 2 ;...;s m cos ((s 1 m 1 s 2 m 2 . . . s m m m )z);\n\ns 1 1 c 12 s 1 ;s 2 ;...;s m sin ((s 1 m 1 s 2 m 2 . . . s m m m )z);\n\nwhere we sum over all (s 2 ; . . . ; s m ) P fÀ1; 1g mÀ1 . The entries of the previous matrix are almost periodic functions [1]. For an almost periodic function\n\nwhere m j are distinct real numbers and the set of Fourier coefficients fc j g is bounded, we define the Fourier spectrum as the set of those real numbers m for which the related coefficients c(m) def lim\n\nT3 I 1 2T T ÀT f (t)e Àimt dt are T 0. The Fourier spectrum of an almost periodic function is an, at most countably, infinite subset of R. The Fourier spectrum of the entries of the product matrix is contained in the set m j1 s j n j a j : s j AE 1 ( A ; where zero may (resp. cannot) belong to the Fourier spectrum of the diagonal (resp. off-diagonal) entries. Thus the Fourier spectrum has at most 2 m points and its maximum is m 1 . . . m m .

It is easy to prove the preceding relation using the formula (4.49). p 4.5 -Recovering the period map from the scattering matrix\n\nIn this section we indicate how the period map of the periodic-plus-impurity problem can be recovered from the scattering coefficients a(k) and b(k). We shall restrict ourselves to the piecewise constant case, although the reduction of the scattering coefficients to the period map goes through in general.\n\nAs the periodic part we consider Q 0 (x) 0 and n 0 (x) n j (b jÀ1 < x < b j , j 1; . . . ; m). Here 0 b 0 < b 1 < . . . < b m p and a j b j À b jÀ1 (j 1; . . . ; m). The impurity consists of defining Q i (x) 0 and 1 e(x) (N j =n j ); b jÀ1 < x < b j ; j 1; . . . ; m;\n\nx = P [0; p]:\n\n( Now let us define M i (l) as the matrix M(l) in the period with impurities with n j replaced by N j (j 1; . . . ; m). 9 Then outside the interval [0; p] the Jost solutions can be expressed in the Floquet solutions as follows:\n\n; 4:51 we obtain\n\n:\n\n;\n\n: Equations (4.52) allow us to compute the period map M i (l) of the periodic-plus-impurity problem if the impurity is concentrated in one period, the periodic data are known, and a(k) and b(k) are known. The latter scattering data can easily be computed from one reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient by using (4.37) and (4.39). More generally, let the impurity be concentrated in [ À Mp; Np], where M is a nonnegative integer and N a positive integer. Then f 1 (k; x) c 1 (k; x) for x ! Np and f 2 (k; x) c 2 (k; x) for x ÀMp. Now let M i (l) be the period map of the periodicplus-impurity problem for computing solutions at x Np from those at x 0, and let M iÀ (l) be the period map of the periodic-plus-impurity problem to compute solutions at x 0 from those at x ÀMp. Then\n\n: (4:53b) Equations (4.53) allow us to compute the period maps M i (l) and M iÀ (l) of the periodic-plus-impurity problem if the impurity is concentrated in finitely many (known) periods, the periodic data are known, and a(k) and b(k) are known. The latter scattering data can easily be computed from one reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient by using (4.37) and (4.39). Let us write N(l) M i (l) À1 M(l) as in (4.52a). Then\n\n[N 11 (l) À N 22 (l)][f H (l; p) À u(l; p)] À N 12 (l)u H (l; p):\n\n5 -First results on the identification of the refractive index\n\nIn this section we propose a method to determine the refractive indices n j and the layer amplitudes a j knowing the period map, in the piecewise constant case when each crystal period is made of two or three different materials with constant index.\n\nThis kind of heterostructure is generally made of no more than three layers per period [7], [14]. An example of periodic structure with period p in the case of piecewise constant refractive index is depicted in Figure 4.\n\nLet us consider a crystal where in each period there are two different media with refractive indices n 1 and n 2 , respectively, where n 1 T n 2 (the n 1 n 2 case is trivial).\n\nWe can evaluate n [31] Setting m max m 1 m 2 the maximum of the spectrum, we can calculate the layer amplitudes by solving the following system:\n\nLet us now consider a crystal with period p where each period is made of three different materials with refractive indices n 1 , n 2 and n 3 . If n i n j for i T j we have the preceding case, so we consider n i T n j for i T j.\n\nAs in the previous example we can evaluate the refraction indices by using the following formulas where the set fg 1 ; g 2 ; g 3 g is one of the possible permutations of indices f1; 2; 3g. Let m g 3 be the minimal value of m j . Then the two largest numbers in the spectrum are m max m 1 m 2 m 3 m g 1 m g 2 m g 3 and e m m g 1 m g 2 À m g 3 m max À 2m g 3 :\n\nFrom Lemma 4.1 we have c s g 1 ;s g 2 ;s g 3 c s g 1 ;s g 2 ;Às g 3 c s g 1 ;s g 2 ;\n\nwhere c 1 g 1 ;1 g 2 ;1 g 3 and c 1 g 1 ;1 g 2 ;À1 g 3 are the matrix Fourier coefficient matrices evaluated in m max and e m, respectively. c s g 1 ;s g 2 is the matrix of Fourier coefficients of a ``virtual'' crystal made up of two layers with refractive indices n g 1 and n g 2 , respectively, and period a g 1 a g 2 .\n\nLet us calculate c s g 1 ;s g 2 c s g 1 ;Às g 2 c s g 1 :\n\nThen the matrix c s g 1 is the matrix of Fourier coefficients of a ``virtual'' homogeneous crystal made of a medium with refractive index n g 1 and period a g 1 .\n\nIf n g 1 n 1 (n g 1 n 3 ) then g 1 1 (g 1 3); otherwise (i.e., if n g 1 T n 1 and n g 1 T n 3 ) the value of g 1 is 2.\n\nFrom c 1 g 1 ;1 g 2 we can evaluate n g 1 and n g 2 by using relations (4.50). Knowing g 1 we can estimate g 2 comparing n g 2 with n 1 , n 2 and n 3 ; the value of g 3 is determined as a result.\n\nTo calculate a 1 , a 2 and a 3 we can solve the following system n 1 a 1 n 2 a 2 n 3 a 3 m max n g 1 a g 1 g 2 a g 2 À n g 3 a g 3 e m a 1 a 2 a 3 p V b b X 5:2 and observe that in the second equation the indices fg 1 ; g 2 ; g 3 g are known from the previous analysis.\n\nIn this paper, a complete characterization of mono-dimensional photonic crystals has been given. We have calculated the solutions in a photonic crystal with and without impurities. In particular, we have analysed a structure consisting of a finite number of periodic layers with constant refractive index.\n\nWe have paid particular attention to the period map and determined the relation with the scattering matrix and the scattering coefficients a(k) and b(k). We have estimated the discrete eigenvalues introduced in band gaps by impurities.\n\nFinally, we have developed an algorithm to recover the refractive index in the piecewise constant case when each period of the crystal is made of two or three different materials.\n\nIt is an open problem how to develop an algorithm for refractive index recovery when each period is composed of more than three layers. Moreover it could be very interesting to extend the formalism of Hill's discriminant to determine band gaps in a bi-dimensional or three-dimensional crystal.\n\n[33]\n\nLet us solve the differential equation (A.1) under the boundary conditions (3.3) by the method of variation of parameters. Writing c(l; x) c 1 (x)f 1 (l; x) c 2 (x)f 2 (l; x); we arrive at the linear system f 1 (l; x) f 2 (l; x)\n\n;\n\nwhere the system determinant equals w.
