    "full_text": "In explaining osmotic movement of water. it is customary in plant physiology to regard water move- ment between cells as taking place along gradients of diffusion pressure deficit or suction force. Efforts to describe water movement quantitatively are based on the assumption that the rate of water movement be- tween two cells should be proportional to the difference between the diffusion pressure deficits (or suction forces) of the two cells. The purpose of this paper is to consider some aspects of the theory of osmotic water movement which arise out of this elementary rate problem, and indicate some fundamental diffi- culties in the concepts currently in use. First we shall examine critically the meaning of the concepts \"suction force\" and \"diffusion pressure deficit\". Then their applicability as parameters of osmotic water movement will be considered. Finally, the value of rate measurements in indicating the mechan- ism of osmosis will be reviewed, and a hypothesis concerning the mechanism of osmotic flow will be presented.\n\nSUCTION FORCE. The suction force of an osmotic unit such as a cell, is defined (1, 54) in two distinct ways. First, it is taken to be equal to the osmotic potential of that solution which, at atmospheric pressure, would be in osmotic equilibrium with the unit in its existing state. By osmotic potential (H1, atm)2\n\nwe mean the pressure which would have to be applied to a solution to maintain osmotic equilibrium between it and pure water, through an ideal semipermeable membrane. The term \"osmotic potential\" is used for this potential pressure, commonly called \"osmotic pressure\", to minimize confusion between it and actual existing hydrostatic pressure, designated P (atm).\n\nSecond, the suction force (S) of an osmotic unit is stated (1, 54) to have the value S=II-P I HI and P refer to osmotic potential and pressure with- in the osmotic unit. This equation usually is not ac- 1 Received November 25, 1959. 2 An appendix defining all mathematical symbols used here, appears at the end of the paper.\n\ncurately justified, so that the student is obliged to accept on faith that S defined by equation I has the same value as when defined by the equilibrium criterion first mentioned. The meaning of equation I can be seen by comparing its transposed form P1 = I1-S1 II with the demonstrable fact that the pressure required to maintain osmotic equilibrium between two solutions must be equal to the difference in their osmotic po- tentials, PI = l -12III (This relationship is readily derived from the basic equation for osmotic equilibrium, equation IV, to be discussed below.) It is thus seen that S, must have the same value as H2, the external solution which would be in equilibrium with osmotic unit 1 with its osmotic potential H1, and pressure Pl. Equation I is, therefore, consistent with the experimental definition of S first mentioned; it defines a state of the osmotic unit useful in predicting whether or not equilibrium can obtain between it and any second unit. From equation II it is readily shown, in a manner similar to that used above for an external solution, that any two osmotic units can be in equilibrium if and only if they have the same value of S.\n\nDiffusion pressure deficit is widely accepted as having the same meaning and quantitative value as suction force. A different concept is involved, how- ever, which must now be examined.\n\nDIFFUSION PRESSURE. Osmosis is commonly held by plant physiologists to be a diffusion process, which may explain why the terms to be discussed are so pop- ular. Diffusion pressure deficit is defined as follows:\n\n\"Diffusion pressure deficit of water . . . . is the amount by which its diffusion pressure is less than that of pure water at the same temperature and under atmospheric pressure\" (34).\n\nDiffusion pressure is a hypothetical quantity which is supposed to govern the rate of diffusion out of a solution. The quantitative basis of diffusion pressure, according to modern usage throughout plant physiol- ogy, is the same parameters as are used to define S. This is shown, for example, by the statement, \"The osmotic pressure is an index indicating quantitatively the amount by which diffusion pressure of water in the solution is less than that of pure water at the 783 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY same temperature and under atmospheric pressure\" (34).\n\nA consequence of basic considerations in thermo- dynamics, which may be found in any modern treatise of the subject, is that the pressure (P1) required to maintain ideal osmotic equilibrium between two solu- tions is given by RT\n\nPi\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the partial vapor pressures3 of the solvent in solutions 1 and 2, and the positive pressure P1 is applied to solution 1; V is the partial molal volume of the solvent. When solution 2 is pure solvent, then P1 is equal to the osmotic potential (H11)\n\nof solution 1, as is well known. Since the partial vapor pressure of solvent approaches zero as its con- centration tends to zero, it foll6lvs that the osmotic potential of a solution increases without limit as the solvent concentration approaches zero as a limit. That this must be so, can be seen by considering, for example, a sample of pure glycerol separated from water by a membrane permeable only to water. To maintain equilibrium, it would be necessary to increase the diffusion rate of water out of the glycerol until it equalled the rate of diffusion of water into the glycerol; but pure glycerol would contain no water at all, so it would be impossible to maintain equilibrium by any pressure.\n\nThe diffusion pressture of pure water must be the difference between the diffusion pressures of water and of a solution containing no water at all, in other words it must be equal to the diffusion pressure deficit of a solution containing no water, or to its 'osmotic potential if it is at atmospheric pressure. It-fdflows from what has been said above that tfie diffusion pressure of pure water must be infinitely Iai#'l; this has been remarked by Crafts,Currier,and' Stocking (12). The diffusion pressure deficit of a solution (the difference between diffusion pressures of pure water and of water in the solution) is hence the differ- ence between an infinitely large quantity and some other quantity, and therefore can have no numerical value. It is not possible to obviate this difficulty in the fashion, which seems to have been accepted almost throughout plant physiology, of setting the diffusion pressure of pure water equal to zero (12), as this amounts to setting infinity equal to a finite number. Diffusion pressure deficit is self-contradictorv be- cause the definition of this quantity in terms of diffu- sion pressures, and of osmotic potential and hydrostatic pressure (equation I), is not consistent. In other words, there cannot be a diffusion pressure which can be defined by the statements quoted above, and if there is no such quantity as diffusion pressure, there .\n\nOr fugacities, for solvents whose vapor does not be- have as an ideal gas. For the original derivation, see (15). cannot be a diffusion pressure deficit. The concept is simply not valid.\n\nThe idea of diffusion pressure as explaining os- mosis was originated by Haldane (20), whose theo- retical work is cited as the basis for introducing the concept of diffusion pressure into plant physiology (33). It is important to note that in Haldane's theory of osmosis, the diffusion pressure difference between a solution and pure solvent was explicitly not equal to the osmotic potential of the solution, and so was not identical to the diffusion pressure deficit as defined by more recent authors (equation I). The concepts of diffusion pressure are, consequently, also not the same. Thus in modern usage diffusion pressure deficit is not only self-contradictory, but it conflicts with the justification for assuming that a' diffusion pressure governs osmosis.\n\nHaldane's theory of diffusion pressure and osmosis is inconsistent with equation IV, and therefore is thermodynamically unsound. Hence it would be fruit- less to attempt to rescue the concept of diffusion pres- sure deficit by giving up equation I and substituting Haldane's definition. Neither his nor the modern concept of diffusion pressure appears to have any physical meaning, and neither concept is any longer in use outside of plant physiology. It seems inevitable that the use of diffusion pressure and diffusion. pres- sure deficit in plant physiology will have to be aban- doned.\n\nSuction force does not contain the contradictions just discussed, as it involves no concept analogous to diffusion pressure, but is simply tied consistently to equation I and to the state of osmotic equilibrium be- tween a cell and a solution, as indicated above. The term (not the concept) has been justly criticized (34).\n\nIn the remainder of this paper we shall employ the generalized term \"water deficit\" (S), defined by equation I, for this equilibrium parameter. Since H and P in equation I are linearly connected with differences in the chemical potential of the solvent, S is linearly related to thermodynamic description of an osmotic system, as presented, for example, by lBroyer (5). S can be used just as exactly as chemical po- tential in dealing with osmotic equilibrium through semipermeable membranes, as long as active transport of water is not involved. WATER MOVEMENT RATES. Since water deficit (S) correctly defines states of osmotic e4uilibrium, it should predict correctly the direction of water move- ment in systems not at equilibrium. The assumption that the rate of water movement between two osmotic units is proportional to the water deficit difference, V42 = KOA(S2'-SI) = KOA[(11, -HI)L (P2 -Pi)] V has little more than an intuitive basis in the plant physiological literature, even though it was formulated as early as 1921 by Ursprung and Blum (55). There is some evidence that water movement in or into plant tissues may follow equation V (3,4,6,47), although not all of the results are in close agreement with it, RAY-OSMOTIC WATER MOVEMENT and none cover a wide range of rates. Equation V has been supported by making an analogy between osmotic potential and electrical potential, to which current is proportional (3, 19, 23, 24). Water move- ment is then thought of as determined by a potential drop divided by a resistance to movement. This led to the attractive idea that in steady water flow through the plant, when total flow in each tissue of the con- ducting system must be the same, the potential drop in each tissue must be proportional to the resistance of that tissue,\n\nwhich was suggested by Huber (24) and Gradmann (19) and was formulated by van den Honert (23). However, rates are not proportional to differences in potential with most other processes than electric cur- rent, for example, reaction rates and chemical po- tentials. The analogy provides no satisfying or reliable basis for belief in the principle embodied in equations V and VI.\n\nIn the literature of zoophysiology, equation V is known as \"Starling's hypothesis\" for movement of water between capillaries and tissue fluids. (40). A certain amount of quantitative support for it has been obtained in recent years. It has been derived theo- retically using thermodynamics of irreversible proc- esses (50), but this derivation rests on an assump- tion about rate proportionality which may have only limited application (13). Equation V has been de- rived for a diffusion process upon thermodynamic (7) and kinetic (29) grounds; in these cases it arises as an approximation.\n\nThat equation V cannot be true in general, for rates of osmotic water movement can be seen by the following example. Consider, as shown in figure 1, an osmotic system composed of pure glycerol separated from pure water by an air space, which acts as an\n\n01 . :: .. I.\n\n.I osmotic membrane because water vaporizes into it but glycerol does not. The osmotic potential, and therefore water deficit, of pure glycerol is, as brought out above, infinitely large, but it is evident that the rate of transfer of water from the pure water into the glycerol will have a finite value; it will be equal to the rate at which water evaporates from the water surface and diffuses through the air into the glycerol. This rate will be dependent upon temperature and the cross section and length of the air space, and is determined by diffusion parameters which are not pro- portinal to the (infinite) water deficit difference.\n\nIf osmotic movement of water through a mem- brane is regarded as a diffusion process, as it com- monly is in plant physiology, then the above considera- tions will apply also to glycerol and water separated by a-semipermeable membrane; the rate of diffusion of water through the membrane cannot be proportional to the water deficit difference, which is infinite. Be- fore examining the relationship which would be ex- pected between diffusion and rate of osmotic water movement, we shall first consider one aspect of water movement in plants for which equation VI is clearly unacceptable.\n\nTRANSPIRATION. Equation IV is applicable to states of equilibrium between liquid water at pressure P1 and water vapor at partial pressure p2, if P1 is the vapor Dressure of liquid water at atmospheric pressure. The equilibrium pressure PI is the pressure which would have to be applied to make the vapor pressure of water P2 at the same temperature. By analogy with equation I, -P1 has been called the diffusion pressure deficit or suction force of water vapor (S') at partial pressure p2. In conceiving of water movement in plants as involving successive potential drops, Gradmann (19) was led to assume that the rate of transpiration should be proportional to the suction force difference between leaf cells and aerial water vapor. More recent authors (2, 23, 45) have included transpiration as the last term in equa- tion VI, where S4 becomes the suction force of the air, and r43 the transpiration resistance. It can be seen from equation IV that this means that the rate of water loss by a plant should be logarithmically de- pendent upon the water vapor pressure difference between the leaves and the atmosphere, whereas in fact it is nearly linearly dependent upon the vapor pressure difference (30). The expectation of proportionality between S' difference and transpiration rate is a clear example of confusion between rate and equilibrium parameters, which has serious consequences4. It would mean, for example, that transpiration rate 4This error is related to the cause of failure of the \"diffusion pressure deficit\" concept. In the vapor phase, diffusion pressure deficit as used by plant physiologists (S') is clearly not equal to the difference in diffusion pressures [partial pressures, see (34)], so the term is obviously erroneous. 785 0 . 0 a . . . . . 0 . .0 & .x : :., p 0 \" -I ... , '.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY would increase without limit into perfectly dry air, whereas in fact it should never be more than about twice the rate found in air of 50 percent relative hu- midity (other conditions constant).\n\nThere is another factor involved in transpiration rates which S' difference cannot cope with, and which is particularly significant at high relative humidities where S' and diffusion gradients are nearly propor- tional. This is that in sunlight, the temperature of the leaf can be higher than that of the surrounding air, increasing the internal water vapor pressure of the leaf and therefore the diffusion gradient outward; this effect is much larger than the small effect (pro- portional to absolute temperature) on S' of the leaf, hence it is possible with nearly the same S' difference to have quite widely different transpiration rates.\n\nTherefore, transpiration cannot correctly be in- cluded in equation VI. A kinetically reasonable ex- pression for transpiration rate must be based on diffu- sion coefficients and water vapor pressures (48) not on S'. Suction force of the air is useful only in evalu- ating states of equilibrium, that is, of zero transpiration.\n\nOSMOSIS AS A DIFFUSION PROCESS. Regardless of whether or not a net movement of water is occur- ring, diffusion takes place continually across a mem- brane permeable to water, in the sense that water molecules are constantly moving through it in both directions. If osmotic water movement across a membrane is due to diffusion, it must represent the difference between diffusional movement of wvater molecules in one direction and in the other. A simple way of evaluating the molecular flux in one direction is to imagine diffusion from water or a solution into pure solute, as with the glycerol example considered above. We shall start with evaporation of solvent from a solution, which is proportional to the partial vapor pressure of the solvent and hence, for an ideal solution, proportional to the mole fraction (X) of solvent in the solution, according to Raoult's Law. Diffusion of solvent across a membrane into pure solute is an analogous phenomenon, and for an ideal solution the rate of outward dliffusion (d) should be proportional to solvent mole fraction (X) and mem- brane area (A), and inversely proportional to mem- brane thickness (1), which constitutes the length of the diffusion path kdA\n\nwhere kd is a diffusion coefficient. We wish to know how the rate of outward diffusion will depend upon both X and any hydrostatic pressure (P) which may be applied. One way of evaluating this (there are others, stricter but more lengthy) is with an osmotic system like that shown in figure 2, in which solution 2 of composition X2, at atmospheric pressure, is sepa- rated by a semipermeable membrane from solution 1 of composition Xl, to which a hydrostatic pressure PI is applied so as to maintain equilibrium. As is usual in discussions of osmosis, it will be assumed that to maintain equilibrium, P has to be adjusted until the rate of outward diffusion of water molecules from solution 1 is equal to the rate of outward diffusion from solution 2. This latter rate is given by equation VII. The required pressure is given by equation IV, which can be written RT X2\n\nfor an ideal solution. Incorporating equation VII for the solution at atmospheric pressure, RT ld P, =-_ln\n\nThe difference between diffusional fluxes in for- ward and reverse directions across a membrane sepa- rating any solutions 1 and 2 is then kdA V112= d, -d -(XeeP,V/RT -X9eP2V/RT) XI This is the basic equation for osmotic diffusion of water. A similar equation was derived, by a more detailed argument, by Laidler and Shuler  (29). We may modify it, for the relatively low pressures involved in most plant cells, by expanding ea as the series (1 + a + a2/2! + . . .), and neglect terms from a2 on, because PV/RT will be a number considerably less than one. Then kdA plVxl\n\nWe shall now transform this equation by adding and subtracting one within the brackets, then multiplying and dividing by V/RT. We get\n\nHere the quantities (1 -X)/V are, for dilute solu- tions, approximately equal to the volume molar solute concentrations c, and the resulting terms cRT ap- RAY-OSMOTIC WATER MOVEMENT proximate the osmotic potentials H of the two solu- tions, according to the well-known van't Hoff rela- tionship. Also, if the solutions are dilute, X1 and X2 will be very close to one, so we may take the coeffi- cients of the P terms as equal to one. This leads to kdAV V1-2 =\n\n[(112 -\n\n) -(P2 -P1)] XIV IRT It can thus be seen how equation V arises as an approximation, good only for dilute solutions and low pressures, of the more general expression for diffusion of water across membranes (equation XI). Actual- ly, the difference between equation V and XI will be of minor quantitative importance under ordinary con- ditions, but it is not likely to remain so under condi- tions of low water content or high moisture stress, such as in seeds or desert plants. Moreover, it is important to recognize that in principle, the para- meters of osmotic equilibrium (S) and osmosis rate are divergent. COMPARISON OF DIFFUSION AND OsMosIs. By comparing equation XIV with equation V it can be seen that if osmosis is, as assumed, a diffusion process, then for any given membrane at a particular temperature, the osmotic permeability (K.) should be related to the water diffusion permeability (Kd) by the factor V/RT, which has a value of about 7.5 X 10-4 atm-1 in the physiological range of temperature.\n\nDiffusion permeability to water has been measured for several plant cells or tissues using isotopically labelled water (DHO or THO). In most of the cases the simplest comparison of diffusion with os- motic permeability can be made in terms of the half- times for diffusion exchange (ty.) and osmotic ex- change (ty,, ) of water when the cell or tissue is transferred from one situation to another. Philip (42,43) showed that for a cell or tissue of any par- ticular geometry, and under certain assumptions, these half-times are related to the respective permeability coefficients as follows: t%d ko(E + HIo) XV kd Here e is the elastic modulus of the cell wall (atm) 5   and H[o the osmotic potential at zero turgor pressure Accordingly, we shall compute the ratio of permeabili- ty coefficients from the formula ko/kd = t¼ d/t, Yo (e + IHo)-Five available cases will be examined.\n\nA. Ordin and Bonner (36) found ty values of 5 The equation for osmotic water exchange upon which formula XV is based was derived (41) only for water absorption by a cell, initially without turgor, when placed in pure water. It is readily verified, however, that under the assumptions made in deriving it, the half-time should be the same for osmotic exchange between any initial and final water deficits of the cell not greater than 8 to 9 minutes for diffusion of deuterium-labelled water into and out of Avena coleoptile sections 5 mm long. They also determined t, for osmotic equilibration, by following the change in length when a section was transferred into or out of 0.4 M mannitol, and found a value of about eight minutes. From their data (35) (e + [lo) can be estimated as 150 atm. From these figures K0/Kd = 7 X 10-3 atmn-. B. Wartiovaara (61), who was the first to use labelled water to study water permeability of a plant cell, determined the course of outward diffusion of DHO from individual cells of the alga Tolypellopsis stelligera (= Nitellopsis obtusa). He found half- times of approximately 0.7 minutes, corrected for build-up of external DHO concentration. The os- motic permeability of similar cells of Tolypellopsis was determined by Palva (39), using a density-gradi- ent method, with half-times of about 2.0 minutes. From his data e is found to have a value of about 75 atm; 11w is not given but can be taken as about eight atm from data of Collander (9). Then KJ/K3 = 4 x 10-3 atm-'.\n\nC. Collander (11) determined the permeability of single cells of Nitella mucronata to DHO, and re- ported a permeability coefficient (Kd) of 6.33 X 10-4 cm sec-1. He also (10) found half-times of 5 to 8 seconds for osmotic exchange of water when cells of this alga were transferred between water and 0.2 M solutions of sucrose or urea. H., for the cells is given as about seven atm (10), but it is not possible to deduce e from the data. Information on Nitella given by Tamiya ( 52) indicates e = 32 atm over the range of turgor changes involved in Collander's ex- periments. We may calculate an osmotic permeability coefficient (KO) from the relation, which is given by Philip (41), 0.693 V, 0.346 b\n\nXV\"a AKO(E + HIo)\n\nThe formula on the right applies to a long narrow cylinder, such as the Nitella cell, for which V/A = b/2. The cell radius (b) is given (10) as 0.0205 cm; taking 6.5 seconds as a mean value for ty ,, K, = 2.8 X 10-5 cm sec-1 atm-', and thus K./Kd = 4.4\n\nX 10-2 atm-.\n\nD. Thimann and Samuel (53) followed outward diffusion of tritium-labelled water (THO) from discs of potato tissue, finding half-times of approximately 1.5 minutes fQr discs 1 mm thick. Virgin (59) fol- lowed the progress of osmotic equilibration of strips of potato tissue 1 X 1 mm in cross section, by an in- genious resonance method, and found half-times of about three minutes. Direct comparison requires that the difference in tissue geometry be taken into ac- count. The figures given by Philip (43) suggest that tl L/ty, o should be divided by about three to bring the two into comparison. The value of (e + Ilo) for potato tissue can be estimated as 35 atm from data of Falk, Hertz, and Virgin (17). Whence, KO/Kd = 5 X 10-3 atm-1. The ratio should actually be somewhat greater, since the diffusion experiments PLANT PHYSIOLOGY (53) were conducted at 30°C while the osmotic ex- periments (59) were at room temperature. E. Ordin and Kramer (37) found half-times of about 0.6 minutes for diffusion of DHO out of root segments of-Vicia faba. To compare this with avail- able data on osmotic permeability, it is necessary to compute an apparent diffusion coefficient kd. Infor- mation given by Philip (43) indicates that for a cylindrical piece of tissue of radius b, kd = 0.062 b2/t. Since Ordin and Kramer give the4i.ameter of the root sections as 0.5 mm, kd = 6.5 X 10-5 Cm2 min-.\n\nBrewig (3) and Brouwer (6) measured steady os- motic water movement into Vicia faba root segments, in a method by which water deficit (S) difference could be determined. Their lowest values are about 0.5 mm3 atm-1 hr-1 per cm of root length. If we assume, as was done in computing kd above, that re- sistance to water flow is evenly distributed through the tissue, then the rate of water movement (v) in through each cylindrical shell of tissue, at radius b, will be dS v = -27rblko . - XVI db where 1 is the length of the root segment. Since ths same volume of water per minute moves in through each successive cylindrical shell until the vascular tissues are reached, v can be regarded as a constant and the equation integrated between the external sur- face of radius bo and the outer boundary of the stele, of radius b1. This gives the formula v bo ko= ln-XVII 2rT1 (Si -SO) bi\n\nThe fraction z'/Si -SO) is the osmotic permeability, given above. From figures given by Brewig (3) the ratio of external to stele radii b0/b1 averages 3.6. From these figures we find ko = 1.7 X 10-6 cm2 atm ' min-1, and the ratio ko/kd = 2.6 X 10-2 atm -'.\n\nThe computed values of KO/Kd fall in the range 4 to 44 X 10-3 atm-1, as compared with 7.5 X 10-4 expected on the basis of the diffusion hypothesis. Although in all cases but the first one, osmotic and diffusion permeabilities were not measured at the same time with the same object; and while in every case there are uncertainties about some of the values used, the comparisons are nevertheless in agreement in indicating that KO/Kd is several times larger than an- ticipated.\n\nAmong the possible reasons for this is the extent to which the actual situation deviates from one in which the approximations used in deriving equations XIV and XV hold good. The most serious deviation is likely to be from the assumption, made in deriving equation XV, that change in cell volume is exactly proportional to change in turgor pressure (41), since this can be far from correct (52). 'However, by averaging half-times for osmotic water loss and water gain this error should cancel out; this was done where possible.\n\nIt may be questioned whether permeability of membranes to DHO or THO is not less than to HoO, which would make the measured Kd too small. The diffusion coefficients of DHO and THO are not more than 14 percent less than that of H2018, which is be- lieved to be approximately the same as H2016 (60). Collander (10) proved that Nitella cells are less permeable to DHO than to H20, because they ex- hibit a transient osmotic shrinkage when placed in strong DHO solutions. However, if one plots his data on osmotic transients caused by different com- pounds (10) against permeabilities for the same com- pounds, which he measured directly ( 11), it appears that the diffusion'permeability of these cells to H20 cannot be more than a few percent greater than to DHO. This objection has also been set aside in work with animal membranes to be discussed below.\n\nIt does not seem possible to explain with experimental errors the differences between expected and observed KO/Kd; it seems significant that in studies on animal cells and tissues, discrepancies in KO/Kd of similar magnitude have been found (44). Such re- sults were reported as early as 1935 by Hevesy, Hofer, and Krogh (22). They mean that osmosis takes place too rapidly to be explained by diffusion across the membrane. Ussing (28,56) and Pappenheimer (40)   have accounted for this by concluding that osmosis is not a diffusion process, as so often assumed in plant physiology, but takes place instead by bulk flow of water through pores in the membrane. It is assumed that if the membrane has pores through which water flow can be caused by a hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane, then under a difference of os- motic potential the membrane will behave as if an equivalent pressure difference existed across it. With artificial membranes it has been proved conclusively that osmotic water movement does occur much more rapidly than by diffusion, and as rapidly as under an equivalent hydrostatic pressure difference (31,32). By assuming, as has been done for many years in treating flow through artificial membranes, that the pores are cylindrical and that water flow through them can be described by Poiseuille's law, average pore radii have been calculated, from Ko and Kd values, for several animal membranes, in careful work by Solomon and collaborators (16,38,49,58). It is interesting to note that as long ago as 1930 Huber and Hofler (25), who considered osmotic water movement through plant membranes as a flow rather than a diffusion, attempted to calculate radii for pores in the Salvinia cell membrane by using a formula which had been worked out for artificial membranes. CAUSE OF FLOW THROUGH MEMBRANES. It is not obvious that a concentration difference across a membrane should have the same effect as a pressure difference, and thus lead to flow rather than diffusion of water through pores in it. Chinard (7,8) has objected to the concept of water flow, pointing out RAY-OSMOTIC WATER MOVEMENT that in the presence of a concentration difference alone, no hydrostatic pressure difference capable of causing a flow exists across the membrane. Dick (14) and Harris (21) also reject the idea of bulk flow through cell membranes, stating that Poiseuille's law should not hold in channels of molecular dimen- sions.6 No physical explanation of why water flow should occur under a concentration difference seems to have become widely accepted. This section pre- sents a proposal about the mechanism of osmotic water movement from which, it is felt, the occurrence of water flow through membranes having pores can be seen to be natural and inevitable.\n\nWe shall consider, as shown in figure 3a, a mem- brane of thickness 1, containing pores of radius b, which allow the entry of water but not of osmotically active solutes present in the adjacent solutions. If, first, pure water is present on both sides of the mem- brane, and isotopically labelled water is introduced on one side, it will diffuse through the membrane along a concentration gradient (c1 -c2)/1. If, however, an osmotic solution is placed on one side (c9) and pure water at the same pressure on the other side (c1), it is seen that the concentration gradient is, ef- fectively, restricted to the aperture of the pore open- ing into c9, since only water, not solute, can pass into the pore. The distance over which the concen- tration changes from c2 to pure water will be about the same as the pore radius b, since solute molecules which are, for example, larger than the pore aperture will not be able to penetrate any farther into the pore. Thus, for a given difference in water concentration induced osmotically, the concentration gradient will be steeper, and diffusion will tend to be more rapid, than for labelled water in proportion as 1 is larger than b. If the pore presented little resistance to water flow, water would flow into and through the pore from c1 as fast as it diffuses out along the concentration gradient into c, at the pore aperture, so causing osmotic water movement to take place by bulk flow and to be more rapid than can be accounted for by measuring diffusion of water across the membrane.\n\nHowever, with thick artificial membranes, and probably with natural membranes as well, the relation between b and 1 is such that considerable viscous resistance to water flow is offered by the pore. Rather than preventing water flow, this proves to be the feature by which pressure effects and osmotic effects become closely comparable, as we shall now see. Diffusion of water from within the pore aper- ture into c9, if not compensated for by flow from c, will result in a decrease in the volume of water within the part of the pore adjacent to the aperture, and hence a decrease in pressure there. Thus there arises 6 Harris ( 21) offers an explanation for the discrepancy between measured rates of osmosis and water diffusion which is, actually, a proposal that bulk flow through pores is driven by differences in molecular bombardment at the two ends of the pore. KY  Changes in solute osmotic potential H and pressure P along the length of the pore. if membrane is impermeable to solute and separates a solution (at c2) from water (at c1), the solution and water being at the same pressure. c: Similar changes for a membrane permeable to the solute. a pressure gradient within the pore, between solution c1 and the aperture of the pore next to solution c9. along which water must flow (and diffuse) from cl to c9. This situation is illustrated in figure 3b.\n\nDiffusion out of the pore aperture into c2 can be described by equation XI or, more simply, with its approximate form, equation XIV. -If we call AP the pressure drop within the pore aperture and re- member that there is only water within the pore, then the rate of diffusion of water through the aperture will be\n\nwhere A represents the cross-sectional area of the pore, and k'w the diffusion coefficient of water in the pore. Considering now water movement within the pore as the sum of diffusion and bulk flow under the pressure gradient AP/l, then if flow is described by Poiseuille's law Ak'WV . AP Ab2 . Ap into c2. Hence we may set equations XVIII and XIX equal to one another and solve for AP.\n\n12 AP= XX b RTb8 1+ + 1 8qk',VI\n\nThis indicates that the pressure drop within the pore will approach the numerical value of the osmotic po- tential difference between the external solution and that inside the pore, provided 1 is sufficiently larger than b. This is equivalent to saying that under these conditions, diffusion equilibrium will practically pre- vail between the water in solution c2 and the contents of the pore just inside the aperture, and that osmotic water movement is controlled by the rate of water flow within the pore. The range of pore dimensions within which this will be the case can be seen by computing the value of the denominator in equation XX for arbitrary values of b and 1, which has been done in table I. Whenever this value is not sig- nificantly greater than one, the pressure drop within the pore will approach the osmotic potential of the external solution c2.\n\nIf diffusion equilibrium practically prevails at the pore aperture next to c2, it should do so also at the aperture next to cl, so if cl is now an osmotic solu- tion, the pressure drop induced within the length of the pore should be equal to the difference in pressure drops AP which arise at its two apertures, or equal to 112 -III It thus becomes apparent why an os- motic potential difference should cause the mem- brane to behave as if a comparable hydrostatic pressure difference existed across it. The rate of water move- ment through the pore will be equal to the water flow and diffusion induced along its length by the total pressure difference between its ends, this being the pressure difference induced osmotically plus any hy- drostatic pressure difference between the two solu- tions, so from equation XIX, difference fl2 -H, (the denominator in equation XX being greater than one), it appears that the rate of osmotic water movement must be less than the water flow under a numerically equal hydrostatic pressure difference, so that equation V would not hold true.\n\nThe limiting case, where &P approaches zero, was the case discussed initially in this section. Actually, the pore dimensions in which this situation could arise (table I) are mostly such as to make the membrane rather or very permeable to dissolved substances, a situation which would also decrease osmotic flow in comparison with pressure flow, as will now be dis- cussed.\n\nDIFFUSIBLE SOLUTES. The restricted diffusion permeability of a porous membrane to a solute7, com- pared to water, may be considered as the result of two effects: I. Within the pores of the membrane, the diffu- sion coefficient of the solute (k's) is restricted, due to frictional hindrance to molecular movement, to a greater extent than is that of water (k',).\n\nII. At the pore aperture entry of solute molecules is restricted, by comparison with water molecules, be- cause molecules which impinge upon the pore aperture can enter the pore only if they are not deflected by striking its edge: for the larger solute molecules, a smaller fraction of the total pore area can be hit with- out involving collision with an edge, than for water molecules. This geometrical effect is discussed by Pappenheimer (40). That fraction of the pore area available to water, which is not available to solute in consequence of this effect, will be called the re- flection factor 4 for the solute. Its maximum value is one, in the case of a membrane completely imper- meable to the solute, as in the preceding section.\n\nDiffusional entry of molecules into the pore will be in proportion to the number of collisions with the\n\n81 This has the same form as equation XIV, but a larger value because of the appearance of the bulk flow term b2/8-q. As shown by Pappenheimer (40), this term becomes less and less important as the pore radius is reduced, until at very small radii osmotic water move- ment would have the appearance of pure diffusion; it is to be noted, however, that within the membrane this diffusion is considered to be occurring along a pressure gradient rather than a concentration gradient. On the other hand, at radii where the bulk flow term is large compared with the diffusion term, flow is the principal mechanism of osmotic water movement, and osmosis occurs more rapidly than diffusion of water across the membrane, as in the examples examined in the preceding section.\n\nFor membranes in which the pressure drop AP induced osmotically is less than the osmotic potential XXI 7 The solutes referred to are, throughout, lipid-insoluble ones incapable of penetrating the membrane at an ap- preciable rate by solution in a lipid phase.\n\nTABLE I RATIOS OF Il TO AP FOR VARIOUS PORE DIMENSIONS * PoRE PORE LENGTH, A RADIUS, 10 100 1,000 10,000 3 1.5 1.05 1.0 1.0 10 9.2 1.8 1.08 1.01 30 199 21 3.0 1.2 100 7,200 721 73 8.2\n\n* Calculated from equation XX using the viscosity and diffusion coefficient (60) of water at 250 C. pore aperture which do not result in reflection at the edges. Effective collisions of solute and of water molecules will be in proportion to their mole fractions XS and Xw, and to the relative pore areas available to them ([1 -4] to one). Hence during steady diffusion of solute from a solution to pure water across the membrane, the mole fractions of solute and water just inside the pore aperture (X's, X',) will be related to those outside by the expression\n\nXw as independent of flow of solution. This approximation is satisfactory as long as the solute concentration difference is sufficiently small in relation to the hy- draulic conductivity of the membrane, as can be seen from the equations given by Jacobs (27). It appears that this condition holds sufficiently well for biological situations and membranes with small pores, such as cell membranes, which are of interest here. Otherwise, the relationship between osmotic flow and solute concentration becomes more complex. The value of qr to be used in equation XXIII and those following, is that for the average composition of the solution flowing within the pore.\n\nSubstitution, for AP and X's, of the values given above, leads to kfwv\n\nThe resulting solute mole fraction profile is diagram- med in figure 3c.\n\nFor ordinary solutions we may, as before, with sufficient accuracy take X, and X', equal to one.\n\nThus the difference in solute mole fraction outside and inside the aperture (X8 -X'%) will be 4 X.. Water will diffuse towards solution c2 along the resulting concentration gradient at the pore aperture, and, for the reasons given in the previous section, if the pore presents sufficient resistance to flow of solution, the pressure inside the aperture will fall until it differs from the pressure at c2 by the difference in osmotic potential; this difference is seen to be 1T2. Figure 3c shows the resultant pressure profile within the pore. Along the pressure gradient inside the pore a bulk flow of solution towards c2 will take place.\n\nAs before, we shall assume this flow to be described by Poiseuille's law. The net volume movement from solution c1 (pure water) to solution c2 will be the sum of the forward flow of solution along the pressure gradient within the pore and the diffusion of water along the gradient of pressure and concentration within the pore, less the back diffusion of solute along its concentration gradient inside the pore:\n\nTo obtain volume equilibrium between solutions 2 and 1 it would be necessary to impose such a pres- sure difference (P2-P1) that v = 0. This required pressure is called the \"effective osmotic pressure\" of solution c9, and from equation XXIV it is seen to be (p2-pl\n\nThe coefficient X will be called the \"osmotic effective- ness\" of the solute being considered. It varies from zero, for a solute lacking any osmotic effect, to one, for a solute to which the membrane is completely impermeable. Substitution into equation XXIV gives\n\nIt can be seen that the osmotic flow induced by a diffusible solute should be governed by the effective osmotic pressure of the solution X112 rather than by its osmotic potential 112. This fact was deduced on thermodynamic grounds by Staverman (50,51). Meschia and Setnikar (32) recently showed that os- mosis across a collodion membrane, with a series of solutes to which the membrane differed in permeabil- A b2 k WV Vt 2=--(PI -Pp + AP) + (P1 -P2 + AP) + k'wXfs-k'5X'8 X XXIII l 8,Y7 RT Equation XXIII neglects the effect of pressure on diffusion of solute, which will be small compared with the effect on water because the mole fraction of solute ity, obeys an equation of this type. The general ex- is small, and it treats the diffusion of water and solute pression for osmotic movement, developed as above but considering the effect of different solutes, and of solutes on both sides of the membrane, is A h k[wv 1 ± VI1-2 = 8 + RTI Xi (1S,24181,1! -(P2-Pi) ] XXVII It is clear that in the presence of solutes to which the membrane is permeable, osmosis should not follow equation V. This has important consequences. It is not correct to treat osmotic flow induced by diffu- sible solutes as proportional to water deficit difference, as has been done [e.g., (41)]; the osmotic effective- ness X of the solutes must be included. Moreover, equation V fails in that most important aspect of water movement in plants, transport through the xylem, for the cell walls of xylem elements are con- siderably permeable to solutes. Evidence showing that equation V cannot be applied to the xylem was obtained, for example, by Jaccard and Frey (26), who measured osmotic permeability (with sucrose) and hydraulic conductivity of several wood mem- branes. Their data show that the latter conductivity exceeded the former by a large factor in all cases; this was associated with substantial permeability to sucrose. Therefore, it is feasible to include water movement in the xylem in equation VI only if differ- ences in solute concentration within it are quite small.\n\nAccording to the present considerations, the rela- tionship between X and the diffusion permeability of the membrane to water and solute will not in general be a simple one. Since diffusion permeabilities to water (Kd) and solute (K,) are proportional to k', and k', (1-0), respectively, it can be shown from equation XXV that for a diffusion membrane (bulk flow term small in comparison with diffusion term), X reduces to 1 -KS/Kd. For a membrane through which movement by bulk flow predominates under a pressure difference (bulk flow term large compared with diffusion term), X is essentially equal to (A except at small values of q5, or to 1 -K,k'W/Kdk',, so that osmotic effectiveness should be less than 1 -K,/K,,.\n\nAccording to the theory of Renkin (46), with small or moderate restriction of permeability, the contributions of restriction at the pore aperture and to diffu- sion within the pore should be of comparable magnitude. From equation XXV this would lead to the relationship fKsk'\\w / V(Kd-Ks)\\\n\nwhere k. is the free diffusion coefficient of the solute, and H is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane. At moderately restricted permeability to solute, the second term in brackets may be neglected for flow membranes. If restriction to diffusion of water with- in the pores is only slight, the first term in brackets could be evaluated using measured permeabilities and known free diffusion coefficients of water and solute. At very slight restrictions to diffusion of solute, this term becomes practically equal to one; then the prin- cipal contribution to X is made by the last term of equation XXVIII, or the (1-4) term of equation XXV, which specifies the pressure required to cause a bulk flow just sufficient to offset the difference in diffusion rates of water and solute through the mem- brane. This represents the situation in which vir- tually no bulk flow is caused by the solute concentra- tion difference, and a weak, purely diffusional osmotic movement can occur. This seems to have been the case in experiments with diffusible solutes by Meschia and Setnikar (32), for KrkW/Kdk, was very nearly equal to one with glucose, sucrose, and raffinose [cf. diffusion coefficients given in ( 46)], and the observed X can be calculated fairly closely using the last term in equation XXVIII. These authors (32) employed the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane to calcu- late X from rate of osmotic movement observed under a diffusible solute concentration difference, which gave an appearance of occurrence of bulk flow which we suggest was a purely formal one, and in reality pertained to the bulk flow which occurred when a pressure difference was imposed to maintain volume equilibrium. In any event, the experiments show clearly that X was much smaller than 1 -KS/Kd, which is pre- dicted for flow membranes by the present hypothesis of the mechanism of osmosis, but might not have been expected intuitively [cf. (40)].\n\nMeschia and Setnikar's (32) permeability data are given on the conventional concentration basis, rather than on the mole-fraction basis adopted here to simplify the treatment of pressure effects. Osmotic move- ment can be derived, using diffusion coefficients on a concentration basis, in a fashion similar to that employed above, yielding an expression for X slightly more complex than equation XXV. It seems likely that the real relationship should lie somewhere in be- tween mole-fraction and concentration basis. In evaluating Meschia and Setnikar's data the concen- tration basis was adhered to.\n\nThe above interpretation of osmotic water move- ment is not basically dependent upon any of the sim- plifying assumptions made about the shape or path of the pores, or the applicability of particular diffusion coefficients or of Poiseuille's law to movement within pores. As has frequently been remarked, it is tin- likely that Poiseuille's law in unmodified form can accurately describe bulk flow through channels of molecular dimensions; which is not to say that bulk flow cannot occur, as has sometimes been implied. but that the term b2/8,q in the equations should be replaced by some other term dependent on b and 7). Such departures from the simple assumptions used here are equivalent to having channels in the mem- brane related to b and I in the equations and in table I by some numerical factor. Furthermore, consider-RAY-OSMOTIC WATER MOVEMENT ing the nature of processes at molecular dimensions, the pressure and concentration gradients expected within the pores should constitute a time-or number- average of the situation, rather than the invariable state of every pore. Finally, the basic osmotic equation XXVII cannot be expected to hold except for dilute solutions and low pressures, as it contains the approximations which are the basis for equation XIV, and depends additionally upon pore geometry.\n\nOne point which has been omitted entirely is the possibility of a backflow from solution c2 into the pore aperture along the pressure gradient expected to de- velop in the aperture of the pore. A flow from solu- tion into pore aperture would be an ultrafiltration rather than a simple flow, since for a membrane not permeable to solute, only water would pass. Such a flow would involve viscous resistance between solute molecules and water as well as between water and the pore, and hence must be slow by comparison with water flow within the pore. In any case, the supposed flow would not be possible thermodynamically unless the pressure drop in the pore aperture exceeded the expected AP (18).\n\nRegardless of these questions, the important point appears to be that osmotic flow of water through membranes can be viewed as the consequence of pressure gradients set up within the pores by rapid diffusion at the pore apertures, across the sharp con- centration gradients prevailing there. Even the idea of discrete pores, useful in quantitative treatment, is not essential to the occurrence of osmotic flow, the only requirements being that water permeate the membrane as a continuous phase while entry of solutes be restricted at the membrane surfaces. An intuitive treatment of osmotic water movement based on this picture of membrane structure was presented as long ago as 1935 by Jacobs (27). The writer's attention has lately been called to the discussion of osmosis given by Ussing and Andersen (57), who depict a porous membrane as similar to figure 3a, and regard the cause of bulk flow to be lack of penetration of solute into the pore, as was arrived at independently in the present study.\n\nThe mechanism of osmotic water movement and the factors which determine its rate are reexamined from a quantitative point of view. Diffusion pressure and diffusion pressure deficit are held to be self- contradictory concepts, and hence not tenable. Suc- tion force, which is an acceptable concept relating to states of osmotic equilibrium, is renamed \"water defi- cit\" to avoid undesirable implications of the former term which have previously been criticized. Rate of water movement cannot be proportional to differences in water deficit as a general law, contrary to the usual assumption. The idea that transpiration rate is pro- portional to the suction force of atmospheric water vapor is completely erroneous. However, on the as- sumption that osmosis is due to diffusion across mem- branes. proportionality between its rate and differ- ences in water deficit is an approximation good for low pressures and dilute solutions. The osmotic permeability of a membrane is then expected to be related to the diffusion permeability to water, as meas- ured with labelled water, by the factor V/RT. Avail- able measurements on plant cells and tissues indicate that osmotic permeability exceeds that expected on the basis of diffusion by a factor of at least several fold, which cannot be explained by experimental errors. It thus appears, as previously observed with animal membranes, that osmosis is not strictly a dif- fusion process. The idea is examined that osmosis occurs by bulk flow of water through pores in the membrane. Occurrence of flow through pores appears to be an inevitable result of pressure gradients induced within the pores by diffusion at pore aper- tures. This explains why an osmotic potential differ- ence across a membrane causes as fast a water flow as a numerically equal hydrostatic pressure differ- ence. The hypothesis can also be applied to osmosis induced by diffusible solutes, which is not proportional to differences in water deficit.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from Copyright © 1960 American Society of Plant Biologists.
