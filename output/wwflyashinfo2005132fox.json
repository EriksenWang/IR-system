    "abstract": "Thermal beneficiation to remove carbon and ammonia makes coal fly ash marketable as a pozzolan for the concrete industry. The effect of these thermal treatments on the fly ash phase mineralogy (i.e. pozzolanic activity) may vary with ash composition. Fly ash samples with differing CaO contents were subjected to thermal treatment to evaluate changes in phase mineralogy. Samples were heated from 500 to1200 °C in 100 °C intervals. At each interval, loss on ignition (LOI), color, and X-ray diffraction mineralogy were determined.\nComparison of fly ash composition with the silica-alumina-lime ternary diagram reveals stable crystalline phases that should form on heating. The data shows that the temperature at which changes in phase composition occurs correlates with CaO content of the fly ashes. Class F fly ashes are the most refractory, with glass persisting to relatively high temperatures before additional mullite forms. As expected from the ternary diagram, fly ashes of intermediate lime content form feldspar and pyroxene at somewhat lower temperatures. High lime fly ashes (>20% CaO) crystallize melilite at even lower temperatures.\nThese data indicate that the low temperatures of ammonia burn out should result in minor changes in pozzolanic activity in most fly ashes. The potential effects of higher temperature carbon burn out on the pozzolanic activity of fly ashes should depend on the lime content and the maximum temperature. A loss of pozzolanic activity of high lime fly ash is possible.",
    "full_text": "In recent years, changes at fossil fuel electric generating stations have been made to meet regulatory emissions standards. These changes can result in higher levels of carbon and ammonia in the fly ash. Higher levels of carbon are detrimental to air entrainment in concrete and ammonia may produce unacceptable levels of ammonia emission from the concrete. Ensuing changes in coal combustion products have prompted technological developments to maintain sufficiently low carbon and ammonia levels in fly ash for acceptability in its primary market-a pozzolan in concrete.\n\nA variety of fly ash beneficiation strategies are being used; electrostatic and thermal systems are most common for carbon removal. Electrostatic carbon removal has been a viable commercial process since 1995 for converting high LOI fly ash to a useful concrete pozzolan. 1 Electrostatic carbon removal does not have the potential to reduce the glass phase in the ash (the phase primarily responsible for the pozolanic reaction) through devitrification, as it is not a thermal process. Some commercial carbon burn-out (CBO) systems employ a fluidized bed combustor to thermally reduce carbon in all types of fly ash. Temperatures in the 700°C range with a residence time of 45 minutes are characteristic of the CBO process. 2,3 Thermal beneficiation of Class F fly ashes has being used commercially for over five years without agglomeration or compromising the strength-producing characteristics in concrete. 4 This implies little change in the amount and nature of the glass phase in Class F fly ashes processed by CBO.\n\nStudies on the effects of thermal treatment of fly ash show that a significant portion of active carbon was removed with little change in the inorganic portion of a Class F fly ash up to 500°C. By 769°C all carbon was removed, however, the glassy background on the X-ray pattern was lower and it was concluded that changes in the inorganic phases must be ocurring. 5 Where ammonium salts exceed 100 ppm in fly ash, chemical treatment is necessary and has been successfully used for commercial beneficiation. 1 Thermal beneficiation systems used primarily for removal of ammonium salts operate at relatively low temperatures compared with CBO units. 6 One thermal ammonia process involves exposing fly ash to preheated air (as high as 927°C (1701°F)) until the fly ash reaches at least 482°C (900°F), at which temperature ammonium compounds become volatile and are removed. 7 The increasing use of dry flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems that employ sorbent injection (Ca (OH) 2 or CaO) upstream of ash precipitators has led to interest in the possibility of using the resulting \"clean-coal ash\" in concrete. These lime and sulfurenhanced fly ashes, known as spray dryer ashes, generally do not meet all ASTM C 618 specifications, 8 however, have shown promise for certain concrete applications. 9 In this work, four commercially available fly ashes covering a wide range of compositions were thermally treated to determine the kinds of phase changes that may occur at temperatures at and above those expected in CBO or ammonia removal processes. Changes in thermally treated fly ash that may impact its usefulness as a pozzolan in concrete are discussed.\n\nFour commercially available fly ashes were selected for thermal treatment. Ash 1 is from a Pennsylvania plant burning Carboniferous bituminous coal from West Virginia. Ash 2 is from a Washington plant burning Eocene subbituminous Skookumchuck coal. Ash 3 is a spray dryer ash from a Nevada plant burning Cretaceous bituminous coal from the Wasatch Plateau and using dry FGD technology. Ash 4 is from a Colorado plant burning subbituminous coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The chemical composition of the fly ashes is shown in Table 1. Ash 1 is a typical low-lime Class F fly ash. Ash 2 meets the Class F specification; however, it is from a subbituminous coal and nearly contains enough CaO to be classified as an intermediate (CI) fly ash in the Canadian Standards Association's CSA A23. 10 Ash 3 is a spray dryer ash that would be considered a Class C fly ash on bulk composition, but does not meet C 618 on total sulfur (> 5% SO 3 ) and has no significant cementitious properties. Ash 4 is a typical high-lime Class C fly ash.\n\nSplits of the four fly ash samples were heated in a thermocouple-controlled muffle furnace at a rate of 15 °C per minute to maximum temperatures of 500°C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800°C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, 1100 °C, and 1200 °C. Splits were kept at the maximum temperature for one hour, removed, and quickly cooled to room temperature and immediately processed without storage in a dessicator. The loss on ignition (LOI) was determined for each temperature level for all samples according to ASTM C 311.\n\nThe unheated fly ashes and each of the thermally treated splits were ground in a McCrone Micronizer with isopropyl alcohol, dried, and subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using copper radiation with a step size of 0.02 degrees and 1-second count time.\n\nPattern processing was done using JADE software and the ICDD pattern database. The glass index (GI), an index of the relative amount of amorphous material in each sample, was calculated according to the equation GI = (P-C)/P, where P is the total pattern integrated counts less background and C is the total pattern counts after subtracting background and amorphous material. Reported values are averages of fitting each pattern four times. The GI is not a quantitative glass determination, rather it is a simple ratio of glass counts to total glass plus crystalline materials counts which can be used to compare samples. Smaller values indicate less amorphous material and values in the hundredths indicate essentially no glass. The glass \"peak\" centroid was also determined as an average from four peak fits.\n\nColors were determined after micronizing by comparison with the Munsell color chart. The degree of sintering was given a rating of 0 to 5, with 0 being unsintered loose powder and 5 being very, very hard to partially fused.\n\nThe XRD patterns of thermally treated splits of each fly ash are shown overlain in Figures 1 to 4. The key line of each important phase has been colored. Tables 2 to 5 show a summary of the glass index (GI), LOI, sinter, color, and important phase changes with temperature for each fly ash. These tables summarize the main XRD-phase mineralogy as the temperature increases and the glass is consumed.\n\nAsh 1 has a phase mineralogy typical for Class F fly ashes where magnetite is present with hematite in addition to abundant mullite and quartz. The CaO is present as a small amount of crystalline anhydrite and in the glass. Thermal treatment causes mullite and a small amount of plagioclase to crystallize at the highest temperatures. Magnetite is oxidized to hematite. The glass centroid is at 24.3 °2Θ and shifted to lower angles with temperature, particularly at 1000°C and above. Table 2.

Thermal treatment stabilizes a large amount of crystalline gehelenite, some yeelimite, and clinopyroxene at the highest temperature. Yeelimite and clinopyroxene are structurally similar in line positions to that in Ash 3. Hercynite (Al 2 FeO 4 ) is also present at 1100 °C, but is known to be a stable spinel observed only between 1000°C and 1200°C. 11,12 Lines matching nepheline (K(Na,K) 3 Al 4 Si 4 O 16 ) (ICDD file 09-0338) are present from 800°C to 1000°C, with the maximum at 900°C. Nepheline has been previously identified in 1000°C ash from the Absaloka subbituminous coal from Montana. 13 The C 3 A is relatively stable, persisting until 800°C after which it begins to decrease and disappears by 1100°C. The glass centroid is at 29.3°2Θ and can not be effectively measured by 1000°C due to the small percent of glass remaining.\n\nColor changes in the fly ash samples are most pronounced at 500°C and 900°C. A lighter color results from heating to 500°C in all samples except Ash 4. In most fly ashes the oxidation of carbon results in a lighter color. The initial stabilization of a relatively small amount of crystalline melilite may be the cause of the minor darkening of Ash 4 on heating to 500°C. A color change between 800°C and 900°C corresponds to the crystallization of phases stabilized as the glass content is reduced. The color change and loss of glass is much more gradual for Ash 1 and much of the color change involves oxidation of magnetite.\n\nThe standard procedure for LOI given in ASTM C 114-05 specifies a heating temperature of 950°C±50°C, which is reduced for fly ash in ASTM C 311-04 to 750°C±50°C. The LOI data shows a region of relative stability from 700°C to 900°C. Between 900°C and 1000°C the LOI increases somewhat for all samples except Ash 3 which increases abruptly with the decomposition of anhydrite.\n\nSintering, the degree of bonding between particles, increases progressively after 800°C for all samples except Ash 3, which changes from a weak sinter at 1100°C to total fusion at 1200°C.\n\nAs an index of glass abundance, changes in GI values show the temperature at which glass becomes of sufficiently low viscosity for the transformation to crystalline phases to occur. This involves very short induction times of nucleation and crystallization and can occur rapidly (in as little as 10 minutes at 1000°C). 14 The glassy stability ratio (GSR) is the ratio of the weight percent ratio of glass-network-former oxides to glass-networkmodifier oxides (SiO 2 /Σ(Na 2 O + K 2 O + CaO + MgO + Al 2 O 3 ). Lower GSR values are characteristic of glasses with a greater tendency to crystallize or devitrify on heating. 14 Figure 5 shows that Ash 1 has a gradual decrease in glass content starting at 700°C to 800°C while Ash 2 has a sharp drop. Ash 3 shows a sharp decrease in glass after 800°C and becomes almost completely crystalline by 1000°C. The fused glass of Ash 3 at 1200°C is unstable and becomes more crystalline on cooling. Ash 4 shows a strong decrease in glass between 700°C and 800°C and is almost fully crystalline at 1000°C. Comparison of the GSR and the GI at 1000°C in Figure 5 reveals a strong correlation between the two. In these ashes, CaO is the primary contributor to GSR which underscores the importance of CaO on the degree of devitrification with temperature. Regardless of the relative amount of glass compared to crystalline phases in the original fly ash, the greater the CaO, the more crystallized and the less glassy is the sample after heating to 1000°C and above. At higher values of GSR in Ash 1, the glass remains very stable and shows relatively little devitrification in the range of temperatures studied; at lower GSR values the glass in the other ashes is less stable and more readily devitrifies.\n\nThe fly ashes used in this study are plotted on the silica-alumina-lime ternary phase diagram in Figure 6. The bulk chemical composition of the ashes falls within the mullite, plagioclase-clinopyroxene, and melilite fields of stability. Although the boundaries and fields are modified with the addition of other elements, this diagram is a reasonable approximation of phases observed in devitrified fly ash glasses, as mullite, plagioclase, and melilite remain stable phase regions as CaO increases. For example, the addition of magnesium to the system causes a strong reduction in the wollastonite field in favor of pyroxene, yet the mullite, plagioclase, and melilite fields remain. 15 The most important stable phases at the higher temperature thermal treatments are as expected from the bulk chemistry of the fly ashes. Low lime fly ashes are thermally stable and crystallize mullite; Intermediate lime fly ashes (8% to 20% CaO) are of intermediate stability and crystallize plagioclase and clinopyroxene; high lime fly ashes are the least stable thermally and crystallize melilite. Glass content is one of the most important characteristics of fly ash that influence its value as a pozzolan in concrete. Crystalline phases in fly ash are thought to contribute little to pozzolanic reactivity. 17,18 While the thermal history of fly ash may impact the pozzolanic activity through changes in residual strain of larger particles, 18 clearly, any process that leads to a reduction in the glass content of fly ash could lower its effectivity as a pozzolan in concrete. In this work, changes in fly ashes from bituminous and subbituminous coals having a range of CaO contents have been documented for thermal treatment through the region of critical glass devitrification. The process of devitrification in fly ash glass is similar to the glass ceramic process in which thermal treatment of rapidly quenched glass causes nucleation and growth of crystalline phases. 14 A number of investigators have considered changes in ash fusion temperatures as a function of fly ash chemistry and fairly low sintering and fusion temperatures (550-600 °C) are reported to be possible in relatively short times (as low as 10 minutes). [19][20][21][22][23] The present work shows the importance of composition in the devitrification of thermally treated fly ash. Ash 1 is a typical Class F ash with very low CaO and a refractory nature with little potential for reduced pozzolanic activity in concrete when processed at typical CBO temperatures. Although from a subbituminous coal, Ash 2 is also marketed as a Class F fly ash, however, it is intermediate in composition with enough CaO to cause it to be more readily devitrified to plagioclase. Although the product of bituminous coal combustion, Ash 3 contains abundant absorbed calcium compounds from the spray dryer process, making it a hybrid fly ash with a low fusion point. Ash 4 is a typical high CaO Class C fly ash resulting from burning subbituminous coal of the Powder River Basin and contains cementitious C 3 A. Ash 4 is prone to rapid and nearly complete devitrification to melilite, among other non-pozzolanic crystalline alkali metal-containing aluminosilicates, at temperatures between 700°C and 800°C; between 900°C and 1000 the cementitious component (C 3 A) is lost.\n\nBased on the four fly ashes studied the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1. Thermal treatment of fly ashes indicates changes in color, LOI, degree of sintering, and phase mineralogy become significant above 700°C. 2. Fly ashes with higher CaO contents are more likely to devitrify at lower temperatures and more completely than those with lower CaO. 3. Up to 700°C, little glass devitrification occurred indicating that CBO process temperatures should not significantly reduce the pozzolanic activity of fly ash in concrete. 4. At temperatures between 700°C and 800°C high lime fly ashes (>20% CaO) experience significant glass devitrification, that could result in reductions in pozzolanic activity. The cementitious phase in Class C fly ash (C3A) is only affected at temperatures higher than 900°C. 5. Ammonia burn out temperatures are too low to affect the pozzolanic activity of fly ash.\n\nGI, LOI, Sinter, Color, and crystalline phase changes with temperature for Ash 4 (white box indicates not present, gray box indicates appearance or disappearance, black box indicates continued presence).\n\nWorld of Coal Ash (WOCA),April 11-15, 2005, Lexington, Kentucky, USA http://www.flyash.info"
