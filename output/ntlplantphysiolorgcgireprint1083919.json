    "abstract": "Transcriptional activation of the soybean (Glycine max) C H Z / 4 gene (also referred to as\nGmhspZ6-A\n) and increase in abundance of the C H Z / 4 mRNA (also referred to as pCE54) have been previously shown to occur following treatment of soybean seedlings with auxins, nonauxin analogs, heavy metals, and a variety of other agents. To determine whether the G H Z / 4 promoter is responsive to an array of different agents, we have analyzed the inducibility of the C H Z / 4 promoter fused to the p-glucuronidase reporter gene in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. We have shown that a wide variety of chemical agents induce this promoter in a tissue-specific and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, we have used an affinity-purified antibody raised against recombinant G H Z / 4 protein to show that the G H Z / 4 protein increases in response to auxin application and is localized in the cytosol of soybean cells. Recombinant G H Z / 4 protein can be purified to homogeneity on a glutathione-agarose resin, and the purified protein has glutathione Stransferase activity when assayed with the substrate 1 -chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene.",
    "full_text": "Auxin-regulated genes and/or cDNAs have been isolated from a variety of plants and cultured cells (reviewed by Guilfoyle, 1995). Although some of these genes appear to be specifically responsive to applied auxins, at least one group of auxin-regulated genes is induced by other agents. This group includes soybean (GZycine max) GH2/4 (Hagen et al., 1984(Hagen et al., , 1988;;Hagen and Guilfoyle, 19851, which appears to be identical with Gmhsp26-A or pCE54 (Czarnecka et al., 1984(Czarnecka et al., , 1988)), and is related to a number of clones isolated from Nicotiana sp. suspension-cultured cells (Takahashi et al., 1989(Takahashi et al., , 1991;;van der Zaal et al., 1991;Dominov et al., 1992;Boot et al., 1993;Guilfoyle et al., 1993). A tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mRNA, encoded by the parA gene, has been reported to play a role in cell division (Takahashi et al., 1989); however, other results indicate that tobacco genes identical with (i.e. pCNTl14) or related to (i.e. pCNT103 and pCNT107) parA are unlikely to function in cell division processes (Boot et al., 1993). The protein prod-~ ' This research was supported by National Science Foundation grants DCB 8904493 and IBN 9303956. This is Paper No. 12,179 of the Journal Series of the Missouri Agricultura1 Experiment Station.\n\nPresent address: Fruit Tree Research Station, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2-1 Fujimoto, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305 Japan. ucts encoded by these genes or cDNAs are related in sequence to the Escherichia coli stringent starvation protein, which has been reported to interact with E. coli RNA polymerase (Ishihama and Saitoh, 1979;Serizawa and Fukuda, 1987;Takahashi et al., 1991;Dominov et al., 1992), and also show limited sequence homology with GST (Droog et al., 1993;Guilfoyle et al., 1993). In fact, crude extracts prepared from bacterial cells expressing a protein within this family from tobacco have been shown to contain increased levels of GST activity (Droog et al., 1993).\n\nWe have previously shown that the GH2/4 gene is transcriptionally regulated in soybean plumules treated with auxins, auxin analogs that lack auxin activity, and heavy metals (Hagen and Guilfoyle, 1985;Hagen et al., 1988). The GH2/4 or pCE54 mRNA has been shown to increase in abundance after soybean seedlings are heat shocked or treated with agents, including 2,4-D, ABA, kinetin, GA, PEG, canavanine, KC1, NaF, and heavy metals (Czarnecka et al., 1984(Czarnecka et al., , 1988;;Hagen et al., 1984Hagen et al., , 1988)). The tobacco auxin-responsive pCNTl14 mRNA, which is related in amino acid sequence to GH2/4, is also induced by heavy metals, and three related tobacco \"As, pCNT103, pCNT107, and pCNT114, are induced by SA (Boot et al., 1993). Whereas some GST genes appear to be induced by a wide range of chemical agents, at least one GST gene from carnation is reported to be specifically induced by ethylene, and an ethylene-responsive element has been identified in the promoter of this gene (Itzhaki et al., 1994).\n\nIn the present study, we have analyzed the expression patterns and inducers of the soybean GH2/4 promoter in transgenic tobacco plants. Our results indicate that the promoter is induced by a wide variety of agents, including auxins as well as inactive auxin analogs. GH2/4 promoter-GUS gene expression patterns vary with the type and amount of agent applied to seedlings. We have expressed the GH2/4 protein in E. cozi and raised an antibody to the recombinant protein. The recombinant protein has been purified to homogeneity on a GSH affinity resin and shown to possess GST activity. Affinity-purified antibody has been used to localize the GH2/4 protein to the cytosol of Abbreviations: CDNB, l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MJ, methyljasmonate; NAA, naphthalene acetic acid; ocs, octopine synthase; SA, salicylic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TPBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide; UTR, untranslated region.\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 108, 1995 soybean cells and to show that the GH2/4 proteinincreases in response to applied auxin and a heavy metal.\n\nFor western blotting experiments, soybeans (Glycine max, var Williams 82) were germinated and grown in moist vermiculite at 29°C in the dark. Three-day-old etiolated seedlings were sprayed to runoff with the agent indicated. A11 agents used in spraying or incubation experiments were diluted into distilled water at the concentration indicated and adjusted to a pH of 6.0. Unless indicated otherwise, plant organs were harvested 24 h after spraying, frozen in liquid N,, and stored at -80°C.\n\nTransgenic tobacco seeds (Nicotiana tabacum, cv Xanthinc; R2 generation) were germinated in moist sand at room temperature under 16-h light/&h dark cycles. After 5 to 7 d, about 100 seedlings were removed from the sand bed, briefly rinsed, and incubated with shaking in six-well tissue culture plates containing 4 mL per well of buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate [pH 61 and 2% SUC;Hagen et al., 1984) and the agent indicated for 8 h. Seedlings were removed from the incubation medium, rinsed briefly in water, and histochemically stained for GUS activity or frozen in liquid N, and stored at -80°C until assayed for GUS activity.\n\nOligonucleotides used for sequencing and cloning procedures were synthesized at the University of Missouri-Columbia DNA Core Facility. DNA sequencing was performed manually using Sequenase (United States Biochemical) or by automation using Applied Biosystem's DyeDeoxy sequencing procedure. Computer analysis of DNA sequence was performed using IBI Pustell Sequence Analysis software (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT). A11 constructs (i.e. PCR) used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing.\n\nSpecific primers and PCR were used to isolate a -780 to +75 fragment of a genomic GH2/4 clone. The genomic clone used was described by Hagen et al. (1988). An NcoI site was engineered into one of the fragment ends at the start site of translation. A translational fusion was made to the E. cozi uidA (GUS) reporter gene (Jefferson, 1987) as described by Hagen et al. (1991). The resulting GH2/4 promoter-GUS reporter-nopaline synthase 3' UTR cassette was cloned into the binary vector pMON505 (Horsch et al., 1985;Horsch and Klee, 1986;Rogers et al., 1987). The pMON constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens pTiT37-SE by electroporation (Shen and Forde, 1989). Transgenic N. tabacum plants were obtained by a leaf disc infection procedure (Horsch et al., 1985). Based on Mendelian inheritance, each transgenic plant appeared to contain a single copy of the T-DNA, although we have not ruled out the possibility that tandem copies were inserted at the same locus in one or more cases. Five independent transformants were examined for GUS expression patterns, and each transformed line showed similar tissue-specific expression patterns and inducibility by auxins and other agents. Two transformed lines showing the strongest GUS expression were chosen for detailed analysis (i.e. concentration-dependent induction with a variety of agents).\n\nFluorometric and histochemical staining for GUS activity were conducted as described by Jefferson (1987) and Hagen et al. (1991).\n\nProtein Expressed in E. coli: Antibody Production and\n\nThe single intron within the GH2/4 gene was removed using an inverse PCR protocol (Imai et al., 1991) with oppositely directed specific primers designed for the exon/ intron junctions. The intronless GH2/4 open reading frame was isolated by a second round of PCR, using primers for the 5' and 3' ends of the open reading frame. The entire GH2/4 open reading frame obtained by PCR was sequenced to confirm that no sequence errors occurred during PCR. The GH2/4 open reading frame was cloned into the pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) and pET3a (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vectors using standard protocols, and these vectors were transformed into TB1 and BL21 (DE31 E. coli strains, respectively. GH2/4 protein expression was induced by isopropylthio-P-galactoside, and the recombinant proteins were purified on an amylose affinity resin or a GSH-agarose resin (Ausubel et al., 1987). Polyclonal antibody was raised to the GH2/4 protein by injecting 0.5 to 1 mg of purified recombinant GH2/4 protein subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits at biweekly intervals. After the fourth injection, antiserum was collected and used directly or anti-GH2/4 antibodies were affinity purified on a Affigel-10 resin (Bio-Rad) to which recombinant GH2/4 protein had been coupled. lmmunological Analysis SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (1970) using 10 or 12% acrylamide gels. When crude plant and E. coli extracts were analyzed, 20 and 10 pg of protein, respectively, were applied to each lane. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting was carried out using a Tris/Gly/methanol buffer (transfer buffer 1) as described by Harlow and Lane (1988). Proteins were electroblotted from the gel onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) at 0.5 A for 3 h. Blots were rinsed in distilled H,O, immersed and shaken in TBS containing 5% powdered milk for 1 h, incubated with affinitypurified GH2/4 antibody (1:lOOO dilution) for 12 h, and rinsed for 5 min three times in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The blots were then incubated for 90 min with 1 pCi of lZ5I-protein A (New England Nuclear). After the blots were rinsed in TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 three times for 5 min each, they were dried and autoradiographed.\n\nImmunolocalization studies were carried out using longitudinal sections of mature hypocotyl from 4-d-old etiolated seedlings that were or were not sprayed with 10P3 M 2,4-D. Sections were immediately immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 7.5% Suc and incubated for 24 h at 4OC. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in JB-4 (Polyscience Inc., Warrington, PAI. Thin sections (2 pm) were cut with glass knives on a Ultracut S (Reichert, Wien, Austria) and mounted on glass slides coated with 2% (v/v) 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma).\n\nSections were incubated with 2% (w/v) BSA in TPBS for 1 h and then with affinity-purified anti-GH2/4 antibodies for 16 h. After the sections were washed with TPBS, they were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG labeled with indodicarbocyanide (Cy5; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 2 h in the dark, washed with TPBS, mounted on Mowior (Calbiochem), and covered with a coverglass.\n\nSamples were observed using conventional epifluorescence microscopy (Optiphot, Nikon) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (MRC-600, Bio-Rad). Images were processed with Photoshop 2.5 (Adobe, Mountain View, CA).\n\nWe isolated a GH2/4 genomic clone (Hagen et al., 1988) and sequenced 780 bp of the GH2/4 promoter (Fig. l), the entire open reading frame, and 5' and 3' UTRs. We found several nucleotide differences between our promoter sequence and that previously reported by Czarnecka et al. (1988). These discrepancies probably result from previously published sequencing errors or slight alterations in\n\n.i86\n\n-. %wu- promoter -780 to +75. The ocs-like element is boxed (Ulmasov et al., 1994). The putative SA-inducible elements (Goldsbrough et al.,  1993) and G-box element are indicated by the doubie underline. A putative TATA box is indicated by the thin underline. Sequence differences from that published previously (Czarnecka et ai., 1988) are shaded. Differences from our sequence are indicated above the shaded sequence.\n\nthe sequence in different varieties of soybean. It is unlikely that GH2/4 and Gmhsp26-A are different genes, since the nucleotide sequence within the 3' and 5' UTRs, exons, and introns are identical (Czarnecka et al., 1988;Hagen et al., 1988). Severa1 regulatory elements or putative regulatory elements have been identified in the GH2/4 promoter, and some of these are highlighted within this promoter in Figure 1. The Gmhsp26-A promoter has been reported to contain a number of degenerate heat-shock-responsive elements (Czarnecka et al., 1988). It has recently been shown that this promoter has a functional ocs element located between positions -286 and -305 (Ellis et al., 1993) as well as two putative SA-inducible elements (Goldsbrough et al., 1993). Ulmasov et al. (1994) recently showed that the isolated GH214-o~~ element is induced by both active and inactive auxin and SA analogs in carrot protoplast transient assays. The promoter also contains a G-box-like element (Katagiri and Chua, 1992) located between the ocs-like element and a putative SA-inducible element.\n\nTobacco Seedlings\n\nWe made a translational fusion of the GH2/4 promoter (-780 to +75) to the GUS open reading frame and nopaline synthase 3' UTR and transformed this construct into tobacco. Transgenic tobacco seedlings (Rz generation) were analyzed for GUS activity by histochemical staining and fluorometic quantitative assay. Five independent R, transgenic plant lines were tested with a variety of inducers, and each line showed similar responses (data not shown). Each independent transgenic line was tested several times and found to respond to inducers similarly each time (data not shown). The quantitative levels of GUS activity in transgenic tobacco plants (from a single representative experiment with transgenic GH2/4-GUS-7) after treatments with a variety of agents for 8 h are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2A shows that treatment with as little as 10-6 M 2,4-D induces an 8-fold increase in GUS activity. This level of induction increases to about 40-, 90-, and 100-fold at 10-5, 10-4, and 10-3 M 2,4-D, respectively. Other strong auxins, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and a-NAA, are also effective in activating the GH2/4 promoter. This induction of GUS activity is not limited to strong auxins, however, since the weak auxin P-NAA results in a high level of induction at 10-4 and 10-5 M. The inactive auxin analogs, 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,6-trichlorophenxyacetic acid (Audus, 1972), induce expression to almost the same level as their active auxin analogs, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid.\n\nIn addition to auxins, other plant hormones induce expression of the GH2/4 promoter (Fig. 2B). These include SA (about 7-, 20-, and 40-fold at 10-5, lOP4, and 10-3 M, respectively), ABA (about 30-fold at 10-4 M and 40-fold at l O P 3 M), BA (about 7-fold at 10-4 M and 4-fold at l O P 3 M),\n\nand MJ (about 90-to 100-fold between 4 X 1OP6 and 4 X 10-4 M and decreasing levels of induction at higher concentrations). Other strong inducers that are not plant hormones include the heavy metal CdC1, (about 50-fold at l O P 4 M and 30-fold at 10P3 M), H,O, (about 2-, 4-, 10-, 30-,  2.

Other agents that we have found to induce the GH2/4 promoter in transgenic tobacco seedlings include the hormones IAA (10-5 to 10-3 M) and kinetin (10-4 M), the heavy metals AgNO,, FeSO,, and CuSO, (a11 at l O P 4 M), 1 mM NaF, 150 mM KC1,lO mM Cys, wounding (cotyledons), and heat shock (40°C for 3 h) (data not shown). In our hands, however, the induction by heat shock is much less than that observed with chemical in-ducers. These results indicate that a variety of agents, including auxins, nonauxin analogs, other hormones, heavy metals, H,O,, salts, and environmental stresses induce the GH2/4 promoter in transgenic tobacco plants. In almost a11 cases, the strongest induction of the GH2/4 promoter was observed at the highest concentration tested for each agent.\n\nFigure 3 shows the patterns of expression in transgenic tobacco seedlings treated with increasing concentrations of 2,4-D, a-NAA, P-NAA, MJ, and H,O,. We have replicated the histochemical staining patterns five or more times with Figure 3. Histochemical GUS staining with CH2/4 promoter-GUS fusions in transgenic tobacco Heated for 8 h with the agent indicated. A, 2,4-D treatments from left to right: mock, 10~6, 1CT 5 , 10~4, and 10~3 M. B, NAA treatments from left to right: mock, 1CT 4 and 1CT 3 M a-NAA, 10~4 and 10~3 M /3-NAA. C, MJ treatments from left to right: mock, 4 X 10~6, 4 X 10~5, 4 X 1CT 4 , 4 X 1CT 3 , and 4 X 10~2 M. D, H 2 O 2 treatments from left to right: mock, 3 X 10~5, 3 X 1CT 4 , 3 X 10~3, 3 X 10~2, and 3 X 10\"' M.\n\ntwo independent transgenic lines (data shown only for GH2/4-GUS-7). At low concentrations (i.e. 10~6 M), 2,4-D treatment results in increased GUS expression in the root tip. Weak expression in the root tip is observed in the absence of 2,4-D. As the concentration of 2,4-D is increased, the upper regions of the root begin to express GUS, and at high concentrations (10~4 to 10~3 M), GUS expression extends into the hypocotyl (Fig. 3A). A similar change in pattern of GUS expression is observed with the strong auxin a-NAA and the weak auxin /3-NAA (Fig. 3B). This concentration-dependent pattern of gene expression is not limited to auxins and auxin analogs but is also observed with MJ (Fig. 3C) and H 2 O 2 (Fig. 3D). The change from root to hypocotyl expression is especially evident with H 2 O 2 , in which root expression is observed at low concentrations and inhibited at high concentrations, whereas hypocotyl expression is observed at high but not at low concentrations. A similar change in expression pattern is observed with CdCl 2 , and we have observed that root tip expression is highly sensitive to inhibition by this heavy metal (data not shown). Histochemical staining for GUS activity indicates that a variety of agents induce the expression of the GH2/4 promoter and that different agents, as well as different concentrations of a single agent, induce different patterns of expression. We have tested the auxin-responsive GH3 promoter-GUS fusions in transgenic tobacco plants (Hagen et al., 1991) with these same agents and found that this promoter construct, unlike the GH2/4 promoter construct, responds only to active auxins and not to other agents (data not shown).\n\nWe expressed the GH2/4 protein in E. coli and raised antibody against the recombinant protein. An affinity-purified antibody was used to analyze the induction of the GH2/4 protein in soybean seedlings. Figure 4A shows that when 3-d-old etiolated soybean seedlings are sprayed with CdCl 2 (lanes 2-4) or 2,4-D (lanes 6-8), a 26-to 28-kD protein that reacts with the anti-GH2/4 antibody accumulates in soybean hypocotyls. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the molecular mass of the GH2/4 protein is predicted to be 26 kD (Czarnecka et al., 1988;Hagen et al., 1988). With each agent, the greatest accumulation of GH2/4 protein occurs at the highest concentration tested, 10~3 M. Other agents, including SA, ABA, benzoic acid, a-NAA acid, and jS-NAA, have been tested and each of these induces the accumulation of the GH2/4 protein. With each agent, the highest concentration tested (1CT 3 M) gave the greatest level of induction (data not shown). Figure 4B shows that different organs accumulate the GH2/4 protein to different levels when soybean seedlings are sprayed with 10~3 M 2,4-D. Elongating and basal hypocotyls show the strongest accumulation of the protein in response to 2,4-D, whereas plumules, hypocotyl hooks, and roots show considerably less response (at least at high 2,4-D concentrations). Figure 4C shows that accumulation of the GH2/4 protein in soybean hypocotyls can be detected 8 h after soybean seedlings are sprayed with 2.5 X 10~3 M 2,4-D,  and 7). Concentrations of CdCI 2 or 2,4-D tested were 10~5 M (lanes 2 and 6), 1CT 4 M (lanes 3 and 7), and 10~3 M (lanes 4 and 8). B, Western blot of protein extracts from plumules (lanes 1 and 2), hooks (lanes 3 and 4), elongating hypocotyl (lanes 5 and 6), basal hypocotyl (lanes 7 and 8), and roots (lanes 9 and 10). Three-day-old soybean seedlings were sprayed to runoff with 2.5 X 10~3 M 2,4-D, and organs were harvested 24 h later. Odd numbered lanes, H 2 O controls; even numbered lanes, 2,4-D treated. C, Western blot of protein extracts from elongating (lanes 1-6) and basal hypocotyls (lanes 7 and 8) of 4-d-old soybean seedlings that had been sprayed to runoff with 2.5 X 1CT 3 M 2,4-D 24 h prior to harvest. Lanes 1 to 3 and 7, H 2 O controls; lanes 4 to 6 and 8, 2,4-D treated. Treatments were for 8 h (lanes 1 and 4), 24 h (lanes 2, 5, 7, and 8), and 48 h (lanes 3 and 6).\n\nand the protein continues to accumulate for 24 to 48 h after 2,4-D application.\n\nTo determine the intracellular localization of the GH2/4 protein in soybean, we used immunofluorescence on fixed thin sections of untreated and auxin-treated soybean hypocotyl. Our results indicate that the GH2/4 protein is localized throughout the cytosol (Fig. 5). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to increase the resolution of immunofluorescence and revealed that the GH2/4 protein is localized within the cytosol and is not found in the cell wall or vacuole (data not shown). Although these results do not rule out the association of the GH2/4 protein with subcellular organelles (e.g. ER, Golgi), the immunolocalization is consistent with GH2/4 being a soluble protein. Conclusions that the GH2/4 protein is free in the cytosol is supported by cell fractionation results, which indicate that most, if not all, of the GH2/4 protein is found in an S100 fraction (i.e. 100,000g supernatant), and little if any of this protein is detected in 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000g pellets (T. Guilfoyle, unpublished results). Immunolocalization re-vealed that the GH2/4 protein accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells in the epidermis, cortex, and vascular tissue after seedlings are treated with 2,4-D (data not shown). Thus, most, if not all, cells within an organ respond to applied auxin by inducing the synthesis of the GH2/4 protein, depending on the concentration of 2,4-D applied.\n\nGH2/4 Protein Can Be Purified to Homogeneity on GSH-Agarose, and the Purified Protein Exhibits GST Activity Recombinant GH2/4 protein expressed in £. coli can be purified to homogeneity in a single step by chromatogra-  phy on GSH-agarose (Fig. 6). The purified protein migrates on SDS gels with an apparent molecular mass of 26 to 28 kD. E. coli containing the same expression plasmid without the GH2/4 open reading frame does not produce a major protein that can be purified on GSH-agarose.\n\nCrude £. coli extracts and purified recombinant GH2/4 protein shown in Figure 6 were assayed for GST activity using the substrate CDNB as described by Mannervik and Guthenberg (1981). Extracts prepared from E. coli cells that contained the GH2/4 plasmid construct had a specific activity of 0.5 units/mg protein, where 1 unit of enzyme activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 /imol of S-2,4-dinitrophenylglutathione/min at 28°C using 1 mM concentrations of GSH and CDNB. Extracts prepared from £. coli cells that lacked the GH2/4 plasmid had a specific activity about 1000-fold less than E. coli cells that expressed the GH2/4 protein. The recombinant GH2/4 protein purified by GSH-agarose affinity chromatography had a specific activity of 10.1 units/mg protein. No GST activity was detected in fractions eluted from the GST column when extracts from E. coli containing the plasmid that lacked the GH2/4 open reading frame were applied to GSH-agarose. These results indicate that the GH2/4 protein has binding activity and enzymatic activity characteristic of GSTs.\n\nOur results presented here extend previous studies of the GH2/4 class of auxin-induced genes and gene products and provide some insight into how this class of genes is regulated. A summary of our major findings follows. First, using a GH2/4 promoter/GUS fusion gene, we have shown that the GH2/4 promoter itself is responsive to a large number of agents, including auxins, SA, ABA, jasmonic acid, and BA. Thus, the hormone-induced increases in GH2/4 mRNA observed in previous studies (Czarnecka 1984(Czarnecka ,1988;;Hagen et al., 1984Hagen et al., , 1988) result, at least in part, from the activation of the GH2/4 promoter. Furthermore, our results show that the GH2/4 promoter is not only induced by hormones, but also by inactive auxin analogs, Plant Physiol. Vol. 108, 1995 CdCl,, H,O,, DTT, and GSH. In general, the GH2/4 promoter is most strongly activated at the highest concentrations of inducing agent applied. Second, we have used GUS histochemical staining to show that the GH2/4 promoter is induced in different organs of transgenic tobacco seedlings, depending on the type and concentration of the agent applied. These results suggest that different organs have different sensitivities to the applied agent and that, in general, low concentrations of an agent induce the GH2/4 promoter in root tips, whereas higher concentrations induce expression in upper portions of the root and in the hypocotyl. Third, we have raised antibodies to a recombinant GH2/4 protein and used these antibodies to show that the GH2/4 protein, like the GH2/4 mRNA and GH2/4 promoter, is induced by 2,4-D and CdC1,. Fourth, we have shown that the recombinant GH2/4 protein can be purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a GSHagarose resin and that the purified recombinant GH2/4 protein has GST activity. Although the GST specific activity is only about 10% of that reported for purified human placenta GST (Mannervik and Guthenberg, 1981), this probably reflects the difference in substrate specificity (i.e. CDNB) between the plant and animal enzymes rather than an intrinsic property of the plant enzyme.\n\nOur results regarding the GH2/4 gene product support and expand the studies of Droog et al. (1993), who first reported that an auxin-regulated gene family in tobacco encoded proteins that showed some limited amino acid sequence homology to GSTs and that one member of this family, NT103 or GST1, displayed GST activity in crude cell lysates prepared from E. coli cells expressing the tobacco protein. Soybean GH2/4 (Czarnecka et al., 1988;Hagen et al., 1988), tobacco parA (Takahashi et al., 1991), Nicotiana plumbaginifolia LS216 (Dominov et al., 1992), and potato PRPl (Taylor et al., 1990) proteins are highly similar (about 50-75%) in amino acid sequence to the tobacco NT103 protein (van der Zaal et al., 1991) but show considerably less similarity (about 20-30%) to other known plant and animal GSTs (for details, see Droog et al., 1993).\n\nOur results along with those of Droog et al. (1993) indicate that a family of auxin-inducible plant GSTs, to which both GH2/4 and NT103 belong, have diverged significantly from other plant and animal GSTs, including a second type of auxin-inducible GST from tobacco, parB (Takahashi and Nagata, 1992). Although the function of this family of GSTs remains to be determined, we believe it is likely that they may function in detoxification and in protecting cells from oxidative stress, because they are synthesized in response to such a large variety of agents and, in general, show the greatest response at high concentrations of inducing agent. Severa1 agents that induce the synthesis of these GSTs are thought to alter the levels of active oxygen species and/or cause oxidative damage to plant cells (Droog et al., 1993). It is worth noting that SA, one of the inducers of the GH2/4 gene, has recently been shown to interact directly with catalase and result in elevated levels of H,O,, an active oxygen species (Chen et al., 1993) that is also an inducer of this gene. It has been proposed that other agents such as auxins and heavy metals (e.g. copper) result in oxidative damage to plant cells and result in synthesis of GSTs (see discussion by Droog et al., 1993). It remains possible, however, that these GSTs might also function in other cellular processes in addition to detoxification and oxidative damage (e.g. hormone binding and/or transport and cell proliferation).\n\nGH2/4 and related GSTs also show amino acid sequence similarity to E. coli stringent starvation protein (Takahashi et al., 1991;Dominov et al., 1992). Because the E . coli protein is reported to bind to RNA polymerase (Ishihama and Saitoh, 19791, a possible role for parA (a tobacco gene related to GH2/4) protein in transcription during the cell cycle has been postulated (Takahashi et al., 1994). Takahashi et al. (1994) have also reported that an antibody raised against recombinant parA protein binds to an antigen localized in the nucleus of tobacco tissue culture cells. In contrast, our results with the antibody raised against recombinant GH2/4 protein localize the GH2/4 protein to the cytosol of soybean hypocotyl cells. Whether the related parA and GH2/4 proteins have different functions within plant cells remains to be determined.\n\nWe originally identified the soybean GH2/4 mRNA as an auxin-responsive mRNA (Hagen et al., 1984, 1988), whereas Czarnecka et al. (1984, 1988) identified this same mRNA (referred to as pCE54) as a heat-shock-induced mRNA. Subsequently, a number of auxin-responsive mRNAs from tobacco that are related in amino acid sequence to the GH2/4 mRNA were identified by cDNA cloning (Takahashi et al., 1989;van der Zaal et al., 1991;Dominov et al., 1992;Boot et al., 1993). Czarnecka et al. (1984), Hagen et al. (1984), and Hagen and Guilfoyle (1985) found that the soybean GH2/4 mRNA was not only induced by auxin but by a wide range of other hormones and chemical agents. Some of the tobacco GH214-like genes have also been reported to be induced by agents in addition to auxin, including cytokinin, SA, and heavy metals (Dominov et al., 1992;Boot et al., 1993). Our results presented here show that the GH2/4 promoter is responsible, at least in part, for the increase in abundance of the GH2/4 mRNA in response to a variety of different agents. Although it is unclear how many DNA elements within the GH2/4 promoter are involved in its activation by this wide array of inducing agents, we have recently shown that an ocs element (Ellis et al., 1993) excised from the GH2/4 promoter confers responsiveness to auxins, inactive auxin analogs, SA, and inactive SA analogs (Ulmasov et al., 1994). An ocs-like element is also found within the promoters of other auxin-responsive GH214-related genes, including GNTI, GNT35, and parA (Ellis et al., 1993;Ulmasov et al., 1994). Based on results of Ulmasov et al. (1994) and results presented here, we propose that the GH2/4 gene and the ocs element within the GH2/4 promoter respond to cellular stress (i.e. oxidative stress) rather than to auxin per se. The structure of the ocs element is similar to tandem AP-1 sites, which are reported to respond to oxidative stress in animal GST promoters (Daniel, 1993; see discussion by Ulmasov et al., 1994). Oxidative stress might be induced by exogenous application of electrophiles such as hormones, inactive hormone analogs, and other agents (e.g. heavy metals, H,O,)."
