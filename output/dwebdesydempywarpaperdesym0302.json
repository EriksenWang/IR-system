    "full_text": "The PETRA ring is presently used as a preaccelerator for the HERA lepton hadron collider ring at DESY. Positron currents of about 50 mA are injected at an energy of 7 GeV and accelerated to the HERA injection energy of 12 GeV. It is planned to rebuild the PETRA ring into a synchrotron radiation facility [1], called PETRA III, after the end of the present HERA collider physics program. One section of the PETRA ring will be completely redesigned to provide space for several undulators. The planned facility aims for a very high brilliance of about 10 21 photons/s/0.1%BW/mm 2 /mrad 2 using a low emittance (1 nm rad) positron beam with an energy of 6 GeV. The planned location for the new hall is shown in Fig. 1. A more detailed layout of the hall and the synchrotron radiation beam lines is shown in Fig. 2 PETRA In positron storage rings electrons produced by photoemission, ionization and secondary emission accumulate in the vacuum chamber forming an \"electron cloud\" with a charge density which depends on the beam operation mode. For certain modes with short bunch spacings and high intensities a high cloud density disturbs the beam. Experimental observations of effects due to electron clouds have been reported from existing accelerators operating with high beam current like the B-factories (KEKB, PEP-II) [2,3]. In 1995, a multi-bunch instability, seen at the KEK photon factory since the start of the positron beam operation in 1989, was explained by bunch-to-bunch coupling via electron clouds [5,4]. Earlier observations of electron clouds, dating back to 1966 and 1977, have been reported from proton storage rings [6,7]. The present understanding of the build-up of an electron cloud and of the effects of the cloud on the positron beam are based on computer simulations and measurements with different types of detectors. A summary is given in [8,9,10,11].\n\nElectron cloud effects have not been observed in the present operation mode of the PETRA accelerator as a preaccelerator for HERA (referred to as PETRA II) with moderate bunch currents and relatively large bunch spacings, but with the high performance goals of the planned facility PETRA III a more complete understanding of electron cloud development and its effects on the positron beam are needed to aid in the design. The computer code ECLOUD 2.3 by F. Zimmermann et al. [12] is used to simulate electron cloud effects for different operation modes of PETRA II and PETRA III. An example from an electron cloud simulation for PETRA II is shown in Fig. 3. The operation parameters used for the simulations are discussed in the next section while the simulation results are presented in section 3.\n\nFor the simulation of the build-up of an electron cloud it is important to know the beam parameters, the vacuum chamber geometry and the secondary electron emission yield of the vacuum chamber material. The data for the PETRA II and the planned PETRA III positron storage rings are summarized in this section.\n\n2.1.1 Beam parameters Four sets of beam parameters are considered for the electron cloud simulations: PETRA II with 96 ns and 10 ns bunch spacing and two operation modes of the planned synchrotron facility PETRA III. The parameters are summarized in Tab. 1.

The injection energy of PETRA is 7 GeV. The beam is ramped up to an energy of 12 GeV and transfered into HERA. This operation mode requires a multibunch feedback to damp the transverse bunch oscillations. The presently installed feedback system requires a bunch spacing of at least 96 ns due to bandwidth limitations. During machine studies it has been demonstrated that it is possible to operate PETRA with a bunch spacing of only 10 ns but with only 14 bunches without any feedback. The beam marker and bunch signals are shown in Fig. 4 (measured on Feb. 2,2003). This fill-pattern of PETRA has also been used for some electron cloud simulations to investigate the dependence of the electron cloud density on the bunch to bunch spacing. For PETRA III two parameter sets are considered (labeled A and B ) with the same total current but with different number of bunches and bunch spacings. It is planned to operate PETRA III predominantly in mode A. The short bunch spacing in mode A of only 4 ns is a concern with respect to the build-up of electron clouds.\n\nThe horizontal and vertical beta-function of a standard PETRA III arc cell and a DBA (double bend achromat) cell of the new ring section [13] are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The standard arc cell is a simple FODO cell with a phase advance of 72\n\n• . The bending radius ρ B of the 5.378 m long dipole magnet is ρ B = 191.729 m. This arc cell is identical to the presently used cell of the PETRA II ring for synchrotron radiation operation. The dipole magnet of the planned DBA-cell is only 1 m long (bending radius ρ = 22.918 m) to provide sufficient space for the installation of an undulator magnet. 0.0 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. 12. 14. 16. s (m) δ E/ p0c = 0 .0 0 0 0 0 Table name = TWISS PETRA III 72/72 Unix version 8.51/13 27/05/03 08.34.57 6. 8. 10. 12. 14. 16. 18. 20. 22. 24. β (m) βx β y 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 25.0 s (m) δ E/ p0c = 0 .0 0 0 0 0\n\nTable name = TWISS PETRA III New Cell Unix version 8.51/13 26/05/03 15.03.55 0.0 5. 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. β (m) β x β y\n\nThe geometry of the vacuum chamber in the PETRA II arc is shown in Fig. 7.\n\nThe chamber has a octagonal shape which may be approximated with ellipses as shown in Fig. 8. The semi axes of the inner (dotted line) ellipse have the same dimensions of half of the actual chamber width and height, while the vertical semi axis of the outer (solid line) ellipse is 35 mm, which is 7 mm larger than the actual chamber half height. For the computer simulations with the ECLOUD2.3 code a chamber boundary is used which is a combination of a straight line and a short arc of the outer ellipse. The boundary is shown in Fig. 9. The vacuum chamber of the synchrotron light source PETRA III is still in the design phase.\n\nOne possible layout of the chamber in the arc is shown in Fig. 10. The beam chamber has an elliptical shape with semi axes of 20 mm vertically and 40 mm horizontally. An ante-chamber is housing the integrated vacuum pumps. For the simulations of the electron cloud effects only the central chamber is considered. All chamber dimensions are summarized in Tab. 2.

First the average beam charge volume density is calculated:\n\nwhere N 0 is the bunch population, A is the area of the vacuum chamber cross section and d the bunch to bunch distance.

The mean number of photons emitted per length is given as:\n\nwhere E is the energy of the positron beam, m 0 the rest mass of the electron, ρ the bending radius of the dipole magnet and α f = e 2 /(4 π 0 h c) ≈ 1/137. Photoelectrons are emitted from the chamber walls at a rate of\n\nwhere Y ef f is the effective photoelectron emission yield. The total number of photoelectrons per length generated from one bunch is N 0 dN e -/dz, where N 0 is the bunch population. The effective photoelectron emission yield depends on the photon spectrum, the photoelectric yield of the material and on the photon reflectivity of the chamber.\n\nThe photoelectric yield of Aluminum as a function of the photon energy η pe (u) shown in Fig. 11 for normal incidence is obtained from reference [14], which is based on the results of measurements.\n\nThe power spectrum of the photons is given by [15,16]: Photon energy / eV Figure 11: Photoelectric yield of Aluminum for normal incidence.\n\nwhere the function S(x) is defined as\n\nusing the Bessel function of the third kind of order 5/3. Furthermore, ω c = (3/2) (c/ρ) γ 3 is the critical frequency of the photons, and P γ = ∞ 0 dω P(ω) the total power.\n\nThe photon density n(u) as a function of the photon energy u is obtained from the power spectrum:\n\nwhich can be rewritten as\n\nwhere F (x) = S(x)/x and u c = h ω c is the critical energy of the photons. The power spectrum S(u/u c ) and the photon density F (u/u c ) are show in Fig. 12.\n\n(One obtains for the integrals:\n\n.) The effective photoelectron emission yield for normal incidence Y ⊥ can be calculated as: Photon energy / critical photon energy Power density Photon density Figure 12: Number of photons per energy and photon power spectrum.\n\nA plot of photoelectron yield times the photon density F (u/u c ) is shown in Fig. 13 for a critical energy of about 2.5 keV corresponding to a beam energy of 6 GeV and a bending radius of about 192 m. For these parameters one obtains an effective photoelectron emission yield of about 0.05 for normal incidence photons (see Tab. 3). Yield * F(u) The effective photoelectron yield for photons at grazing incidence can either be significantly enhanced or reduced, depending on the reflection coefficient of the photons [14,17,18] which is difficult to know precisely. The number of photoelectrons in the vacuum chamber will be reduced for chamber designs with an ante-chamber. As a result of these unknown factors the precise value for the effective photoelectron yield is not know. For most of the simulations an effective photoelectron yield of\n\nwill be used, which is about a factor of two larger than that calculated for normal incidence photons assuming that no ante-chamber is present. An effective photoelectron yield of 0.1 is reported also for the KEK B-factory [19] vacuum chamber. For some of the simulations an even higher photoelectron yield of Y ef f = 1 is used to examine the dependence of the electron cloud density on the number of primary generated photoelectrons.\n\nThe mean energy of the (primary) photoelectrons is about 7 eV. The electric field of the trailing bunches will accelerate the photoelectrons up to several hundred eV depending on the bunch population and the chamber dimensions. A photoelectron which hits the vacuum chamber wall can generate secondary electrons with a secondary emission yield δ SE (E) which depends on the energy of the primary electron and on the material properties. The following data enter into the simulation recipe of the ECLOUD 2.3 code [12].\n\nThe measured data [20] for the secondary emission yield can be described analytically, as suggested by M. Furman [21], in the following way:\n\nwith three material dependent parameters δ max , E max and s, which depend on the angle of incidence of the primary electron with respect to the material surface.\n\nThe secondary emission yield of a non pure (technical) material depends strongly on the surface properties of the material. Various surface treatments have been investigated [22] to reduce the secondary emission yield. A very powerful method to circumvent the problems due to electron multiplication is the \"dose effect\" (or processing). Typical parameters for copper and aluminum after processing are given in Tab. 5. Copper \"as received\" may have a secondary emission parameter δ max of more than 2.0 and aluminum \"as received\" of more than certain probability the primary electrons which hit the surface interact in an inelastic way with the material yielding \"true secondary\" electrons. But some electrons are elastically backscattered off the surface. The Eqn. ( 9) refers to the true secondary electron yield which is plotted in Fig. 14 as solid curves for copper and aluminum using the parameters from Tab. 5. The total secondary emission yield can be written as a sum of the true secondary electron yield and the reflected electron yield:\n\nwhere the factor f R (E) gives the yield from reflected electrons as a fraction of the total yield (δ tot = f R δ SE ). The fraction of reflected electrons has been measured as a function of the primary energy. A fit to the data gives for primary energies below 300 eV [20]:\n\nwith A 0 = 20.7, A 1 = -7.08, A 2 = 0.484 and B = 56.9. The total secondary emission yield is plotted in Fig. 14 as dashed curves for copper and aluminum.\n\nThe reflected component contributes significantly to the total secondary electron yield for primary electron energies of a few eV. Besides the true secondary and reflected electrons there is a third component to the total secondary electron yield, which is refered to as \"rediffused\" electrons. These are electrons which penetrate into the material and undergo multiple scattering inside the material before being reflected back out the material. This component is neglected in simulations with ECLOUD 2.3. The energy distribution of the true secondary electrons is fitted with the following formula [23]:\n\nwhere C, τ and E 0 are parameters to fit the measured data. The energy distribution is plotted in Fig. 15 for C = 0.2, τ = 1 and E 0 = 1.8 eV. The slight dependence of the parameters on the energy of the primary electron is neglected here. The average energy of a true secondary electron is about 3.5 eV.\n\nFor all electron cloud simulations the code ECLOUD 2.3 has been used [12]. The beam parameters and the vacuum chamber dimensions have been taken from Tab. 1 and Tab. 2. If not stated otherwise the photoelectron emission rates are based on an effective photoelectron yield of 0.1 (see Tab. 4). The parameters for the secondary emission yield for a aluminum chamber with maximum yield δ max of 2.2 have been assumed (see Tab. 5) for PETRA II and PETRA III. Plots of the electron cloud population and the electron cloud density in the bunch center are presented in the following subsections. The results are summarized in a table at the end of this section.\n\n3.1.1 PETRA II -Standard fill with 96 ns bunch spacing In the PETRA II storage no performance degradations due to electron clouds have been observed during the standard operation mode with a bunch spacing of 96 ns. The simulation (using the ECLOUD 2.3 code) predicts an electron cloud build-up during about 5 × 95 ns to a total cloud population of 0.46 • 10 10 electrons per meter as shown in Fig. 16. This corresponds to an average cloud density of 0.83 • 10 12 m -3 .

The cloud population is also shown for reference, plotted in arbitrary units (dashed line). The dashed line indicates a density of 0.7 10 12 m -3 .\n\nDuring machine studies PETRA II was operated with a special fill pattern with a bunch spacing of only 10 ns. The simulation of the electron cloud population in this case is shown in Fig. 19. At the end of the bunch train a population of 1.4 • 10 10 electrons per meter is reached, corresponding to an average electron cloud density of 2.5 • 10 12 m -3 , which is about a factor of 3.5 higher than in the standard fill pattern with 96 ns bunch spacing. The equilibrium electron cloud population is not reached within the short bunch train of only 14 bunches. A short gap is sufficient to let the cloud population decay by a factor of two. The\n\nThe two parameter sets for PETRA III (labeled A and B, see Tab. 1) have been considered for the simulations with the ECLOUD 2.3 code. Fig. 21 shows the distribution of the macro particles in the elliptical vacuum chamber at different time steps during the simulation. The electron cloud population, average and center cloud densities are presented in the following subsections.\n\nFirst the parameter set A with many bunches and a small bunch spacing of only 4 ns is considered. The build-up of the electron cloud population simulated with the ECLOUD 2.3 code is shown in Fig. 22. A equilibrium population of about 3.2 • 10 10 is reached after about 100 bunches of the bunch train. This corresponds to an average electron cloud population of 1.\n\n3 • 10 12 m -3 .

An effective photoelectron yield of 0.1 has been normally assumed for the simulations. To study the dependence of the electron cloud density on this parameter the previous simulations of PETRA III (variant A) has been repeated with a photoelectron yield of 1.0 and with otherwise unchanged parameters. The results for the bunch population are shown in Fig. 25. The electron cloud population is 1.5 • 10 10 per meter for this case, which is a factor of 4.7 higher compared with the previous simulation with a ten times lower photoelectron yield. The correspond-\n\nNo electron cloud build-up over the bunch train is found in the simulation results for a large bunch spacing of 192 ns (parameter set B). Each bunch induces an electron cloud with a population of about 2.2 • 10 10 which decays before the next bunch of the train arrives. This corresponds to an average electron density of 8.7•10 12 m -3 . A center density of about 1.5•10 12 m -3 is found from the simulations (see Fig. 28).\n\nThe previously discussed results are summarized in Tab. 6 for the reference parameter set with an photoelectron yield of 0.1. The average electron cloud density has been calculated from the electron cloud population and the vacuum chamber dimensions.\n\nOne simulation for PETRA III (variant A) has been done with an photoelectron yield of 1.0. For that case a cloud population of 1.5 • 10 10 , corresponding to an average cloud density of 5.96 • 10 12 m -3 , was obtained. The center density was 3.5\n\nA vertical emittance growth due to an instability caused by electron clouds has been observed in the low energy ring (LER) of the KEK B-Factory for beam intensities above 500 mA in the case that no solenoids are switched on as a countermeasure [2, Fig. 16]. The code ECLOUD 2.3 has also been used to simulate the build-up of the electron cloud in the KEKB LER using the parameters from Tab.7 and 8, which have been compiled from [24,2]. A secondary emission yield of 1.4 (see Tab.5) has been assumed for the copper chamber. A field free region has been considered for the simulations. The results of the simulation of the electron cloud population are shown in Fig. 29. An equilibrium population of 2.9 • 10 10 electrons per meter is obtained. This corresponds to an average electron cloud density of 4.2 • 10 12 m -3 . The electron cloud center density obtained from the simulation with ECLOUD 2.3 is shown in Fig. 30. The center density of the cloud is about 3.0 • 10 12 m -3 . This is about a factor of three larger than the simulated center density for PETRA III variant A.  0 5e+11 1e+12 1.5e+12 2e+12 2.5e+12 3e+12 3.5e+12 4e+12 4.5e+12 5e+12 0 1e-07 2e-07 3e-07 4e-07 5e-07 6e-07 7e-07 Electron cloud volume density / m-3 Time / sec Figure 30: Electron cloud center density in the KEK-B vacuum chamber (results from ECLOUD 2.3).\n\nA broad band resonator model has been developed in [25,26] to characterize the interaction between the positron bunch and the electron cloud. The basic ingredients of the model are the line charge densities λ b and λ c of the positron beam and of the electron cloud, and the transverse beam sizes (σ x and σ y ). It is assumed that the electron cloud has the same transversal dimensions as the beam. The line charge density of the cloud is therefore λ c = 2 π σ x σ y ρ c , where ρ c is the volume charge density in the center of the vacuum chamber obtained from computer simulations. The dipole wake can be written as:\n\nand\n\nwith r e the classical electron radius, γ the beam energy measured in units of the rest mass, and C the circumference of the ring. The dipole wake within a bunch can be calculated as the convolution integral of the point charge wake w 1 (s) with the Gaussian charge density in the bunch g(s) = exp(-1 2 (s/σ z ) 2 )/(σ z √ 2 π):\n\nThe \"cloud\" frequency ω c is the frequency of the broad band resonator. This frequency depends only on the properties of the positron beam. All parameters of the broad band resonator which do not depend directly on the cloud population are summarized in Tab. 9. A Q-value of 5 has been assumed to take into account the broad band characteristic of the impedance.\n\nThe normalized point charge wake potential w 1 (s)/ ŵ1 as well as the bunch wake potential W 1 (s)/ ŵ1 are shown in Fig. 31 for the PETRA III-A parameters. The dash-dotted line in Fig. 31 shows the charge distribution of the bunch. The effect of the wakefield due to the electron cloud is greatly reduced since the wavelength (2π c)/ω c of the point charge wakepotential is smaller than the bunch length. The quantity W 1 (σ z )/ ŵ1 is the bunch wake potential at the position s = σ z (tail of the bunch) normalized to the amplitude ŵ1 of the point charge wake potential (see Tab. 9). In a two particle model the quantity W 1 (σ z ) is used as an estimate of the wake from the head particle acting on the tail particle.\n\nThe strong-head tail instability can be treated in a simplified way using a two particle model [27]. The equations of motion during the time 0 < s/c < T s /2, where T s = 1/f s is the synchrotron oscillation period, are\n\nwhere y 1 and y 2 are the transverse coordinates of macroparticles 1 and 2, δ 1 and δ 2 are the relative energy deviations (∆E/E) of macroparticles from the design energy, ω β is the betatron oscillation frequency, q is the total bunch charge and W ⊥ the effective dipole wake. During the time period T s /2 < s/c < T s the equations of motion are again Eqn. (17) but with indices 1 and 2 exchanged. For the time interval T s < s/c < 3 T s /2 Eqn. ( 17) applies again, and so forth. The effective wake due to the head macroparticle can be estimated as the wake within the bunch at s = σ z :\n\nThe solution of the equations of motion (17) for zero chromaticity are:\n\nwhere Φ β n (s) is the betatron phase and the amplitude functions y n (s) are solutions of the equation [27]:\n\nwith the parameter Υ, given by\n\nThe transverse motion is stable if the trace of the matrix in Eqn. ( 20) is smaller than 2 or equivalently if Υ < 2.\n\nEquations ( 21) and ( 22) are used to obtain an upper limit for the effective wake W ⊥ for the considered parameter sets. The results are summarized in Tab. The PETRA III (variant A) design is by a factor of about 50 less sensitive to head-tail instabilities than the considered KEK-B LER variant with a bunch population of 3.0 • 10 10 . The wakefield limits for the PETRA III (variant B) and the considered KEK-B LER variant are almost the same. It is also interesting to translate the condition from Eqn. ( 22) into a limit on the product of the bunch population and the effective wakefield (N W ⊥ ). The results are shown in the last row of Tab. 10. It turns out that the KEK-B LER is by a factor of about 8 more sensitive to head-tail instabilities than the PETRA II/III rings which do not differ significantly with respect of this parameter (N W ⊥ ) limit .\n\nThe wakefield of the electron cloud can be calculated from the electron cloud density according to Eqn. ( 14) and ( 16). The results are presented in Tab. 11, first under the assumption that the cloud density is equal to the average beam density (neutrality condition) and using the results for the center density from the computer simulations with the ECLOUD 2.\n\n3 code.

The results are based on estimates from the condition of neutrality and on the center density obtained from computer simulations. W 1 (σ z ) is the dipole wakepotential at the position s = σ z in the tail of the bunch.\n\nW 1 (σ z ) due to the electron cloud have been compared with the previously calculated limit from the instability threshold. The wakefield is well below (< 0.2) the instability threshold for all considered parameter sets for PETRA II/III. For the considered KEK-B LER parameters a head-tail instability is expected since the wakefield due to the electron cloud is above the limit. This is in agreement with the experimental observations of a beam blow-up [2]. The condition of neutrality seems to be in most cases a very useful estimate of the electron cloud density.\n\nThe results of the simulation PETRA III with a photoelectron yield of Y = 1.0 is not included in Tab. 11. The center density for that case is 3.5 • 10 12 m -3 , from which an effective transverse wake of W 1 (σ z ) = 51.4 MV/(nC m) is obtained. This is still well below the instability threshold ( W 1 (σ z )/W ⊥limit = 0.2 ).\n\nIt is planned to rebuild the PETRA ring, presently used as a preaccelerator for the HERA rings, into a third generation synchrotron light source, called PETRA III. Since it is considered to use a positron beam for PETRA III the build-up of electron clouds was investigated and presented in this paper. In section 2 the parameters of the present PETRA ring and the planned PETRA III storage ring needed for simulations, namely beam and optics parameters as well as the vacuum chamber dimensions, have been introduced. The production of photoelectrons has been estimated from the material properties of Aluminum. The parameters which are important for the production of secondary electrons have been discussed, too.\n\nThe computer code ECLOUD 2.3 has been used to simulate the electron cloud build-up in PETRA II & III for different parameter sets. Furthermore the KEK B-factory low energy ring has also been simulated since strong effects from electron clouds have been experimentally observed at that storage ring. No instabilities due to electron clouds have been observed for the PETRA II ring, a result which has also been found in the simulations. The agreement of the simulations with experiments for existing rings gives confidence in the predictions for PETRA III.\n\nAn effective transverse wake potential at the position σ z within the bunch has been calculated from the simulated density of the electron cloud in the center of the beam using a broad band resonator model. The wake potential has been compared to a wake limit for a head-tail instability obtained from a two particle model. It has been found that no single bunch instability due to electron clouds is expected for the planned PETRA III synchrotron light source. The main results from the simulation and predictions for the transverse wake are:\n\nPETRA II PETRA III KEK-B 96 ns A B LER 573 mA Cloud Population /10 10 / m 0.46 0.32 2.2 2.9 Average density /(10 12 m -3 ) 0.83 1.3 8.7 4.2 Center density / (10 12 m -3 ) 0.7 1.0 1.5 3.0 W 1 (σ z ) /(MV/(nC m) 1.2 14.7 0.45 10.4 W 1 (σ z )/W ⊥limit 0.045 0.058 0.085 1.91\n\nA field free region has always been used in the simulation. The synchrotron radiation from a bending magnet with a bending radius of about 192 m has been used for the PETRA II/III calculations. In the new section of the planned PETRA III ring, dipole magnets with a bending radius of about 23 m will be used. Additional damping wiggler sections will be installed in PETRA III which will radiate synchrotron radiation with a spectrum different from the dipole radiation spectrum used in the simulation. This will most likely have no significant impact on the single bunch instability of the beam since these sections are short compared to the total circumference of the ring. Nevertheless the electron cloud density may be locally higher than predicted under the assumptions made for the simulations. This can have an impact on the local vacuum pressure and should be studied in connection with the design of the vacuum system.\n\nThe photoelectron emission rates are summarized for PETRA II and PETRA III in Tab. 4."
