    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers associated with oncogenic differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using an unsupervised clustering method with a cDNA microarray, HCC (T) gene expression profiles and corresponding non-tumor tissues (NT) from 40 patients were analyzed. Of total 217 genes, 72 were expressed preferentially in HCC tissues. Among 186 differentially regulated genes, there were molecular chaperone and tumor suppressor gene clusters in the Edmondson grades I and II (GI/II) subclass compared with the liver cirrhosis (LC) subclass. The Edmondson grades III and IV (GIII/IV) subclass with a poor survival (P = 0.0133) contained 122 differentially regulated genes with a cluster containing various metastasis-and invasion-related genes compared with the GI/II subclass. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ANXA2, one of the 72 genes preferentially expressed in HCC, was over-expressed in the sinusoidal endothelium and in malignant hepatocytes in HCC. The genes identified in the HCC subclasses will be useful molecular markers for the genesis and pro-gression of HCC. In addition, ANXA2 might be a novel marker for tumor angiogenesis in HCC.",
    "full_text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major malignancy with an increasing worldwide incidence (El-Serag and Mason, 1999). HCC ranks fifth in frequency among all malignancies and causes approximately 600,000 deaths annually (Okuda, 2000;Parkin et al., 2005). A lack of molecular markers that can be used to characterize the development, progression, and angiogenesis of this tumor precludes making an effective diagnosis and correct determination of the prognosis. Although a diagnosis of HCC relies on the presence of a liver mass on radiological images, the detection of an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level is the widely used serum marker for both diagnosing and monitoring HCC (Zaman et al., 1985;Lok and Lai, 1989). However, the AFP level has a low sensitivity and specificity. For example, the level can be normal in up to 40% of HCC patients, particularly during the early stages (Sherman et al., 1995), and there can be elevated AFP levels in patients with cirrhosis or with exacerbations of chronic hepatitis (Di Bisceglie and Hoofnagle, 1989). Several biomarkers, such as des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP), lens cularis agglutinin-reactive AFP, and glypican-3 (GPC3), have yet to be examined for an ability to detect early HCC (Marrero and Lok, 2004). Therefore, there is a need for development of novel biomarkers for both early detection and evaluation of the progression of HCC. Genome-wide microarray analysis offers a systemic approach for obtaining comprehensive information on HCC transcription profiles. Previous studies have used a microarray to address changes in the gene expression patterns of HCC (Okabe et al., 2001;Shirota et al., 2001). However, these reports compared HCC gene expression profiles with profiles of non-tumor tissues and ignored the heterogeous disease state of the non-tumor samples, such as normal, chronic hepatitis, or hepatic cirrhosis. Most tissue speci-mens used for analysis were probably of an advanced stage. Therefore, it is possible that most of the changes observed in these lesions did not necessarily imply causality, but were probably secondary. However, there is little knowledge of the molecular nature of early or multistep hepatocarcinogenesis in human HCC, or of the specific genetic changes associated with the oncogenic differentiation of HCC.\n\nCurrently, gene expression profiling studies have analyzed global transcript levels in the context of different histological grades and precancerous dysplastic nodules (Sakamoto et al., 1991;Nam et al., 2005), and identified the genes strongly associated with survival to predict the clinical outcome of HCC (Lee et al., 2004). In contrast, the present study, using a modified analytical approach, was designed to search for HCC molecular markers that are confined to two critical steps of HCC development and advancement. To achieve to this end, the genome expression patterns in 40 paired HCC and corresponding non-tumor samples were first characterized using a pooled normal liver as a reference. Secondly, the gene expression profiles between the genes of the precancerous cirrhosis (LC) subclass and the genes of the well differentiated HCC (Edmondson grade I/II) subclass were compared. In addition, the gene expression signatures between the well differentiated HCC subclass and the poorly differentiated HCC (Edmondson grade III/IV) subclass were characterized. Thirdly, Northern blot analysis was performed to validate the utility of the data. Finally, the ANXA2 expression level was analyzed as a novel marker of angiogenesis in HCC. The identified novel molecules can be used as markers for both diagnosing and monitoring the prognosis of HCC, and as targets for new anticancer management strategies.\n\nThe study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The patients were selected and their sera were tested for both HBV and HCV viral markers using a Cobra Core EIA kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). AFP levels were measured using a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (Abbott, Abbort Park, IL). Paired samples of tumor and corresponding cirrhotic non-tumor tissues were obtained from resected liver specimens of 40 patients with HCC. Histological examination con-firmed the HCC and non-tumor tissues. The extent of the liver disease of each patient was rated according to the histological activity index (HAI), as previously described by Knodell et al. (1981). Total cellular RNA was extracted using a Tri-zole kit (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). The integrity of RNA specimens was verified by gel electrophoresis.\n\nThe cDNA microarrays (14k) used in this study were obtained from 21C Frontier: The Center for Functional Analysis of the Human Genome (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Korea). The microarray slides collectively contained a total of 14k cDNA clones consisting of 8,159 unique, sequence-verified clones and housekeeping genes. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes were generated from 100 µg of total RNA from each tumor by oligo(dT)-primed polymerization using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 µl. The fluorescent nucleotides Cy5-dUTP and Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) were used at a concentration of 0.2 mM. Human reference RNA, which contained the total RNA samples from 6 different normal livers, was used as a reference for the cDNA microarray analysis. Purified and concentrated fluorescencelabeled cDNA samples from the reference and experimental samples were processed using the methodology reported by Chen et al. (2002).\n\nFluorescence intensities generated by either Cy5 or Cy3 immobilized on the target sequences on the microarray slides were measured using a laser confocal microscope scanning system ScanArray 4000XL (GSI Lumonics, Billerica, MA). The fluorescent images of Cy5 and Cy3 were scanned separately and stored for image analysis. Color images were generated by arbitrarily assigning experimental intensity values to the red channel and reference intensity values to the green channel, and vice versa. The signals from each cDNA target immobilized on a microarray slide were localized, and the expression ratio between the experimental and reference signals (Cy5/Cy3 ratio) was determined using ImaGene TM 5.2 software (BioDiscovery, Los Angeles, CA). The fluorescence intensities of Cy5 and Cy3 for each target spot were adjusted so that the median Cy5 and Cy3 intensities of all spots on each slide were equal.\n\nCorrelations of the intensity values for each cDNA between the HCC and reference tissues were assessed using scatter plots, and a linear relationship was obtained in log space. All the ImaGene files were uploaded into the Liver cancer database (http://expcal.kobic.re.kr:8080/hcc/) of the Korean BioInformation Center (http://www.kobic.re.kr). All spots with signal intensities of ＜ 50% of the local background were flagged and eliminated. The data were normalized using print tip loess normalization with the limma in R packages (http://www.r-project. org) using Bioconductor software (http://www. bioconductor.org). Genes with expression values in more than 80% of all tissues were retained for analysis. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to all tissues and genes using the Pearson uncentered correlation coefficient as a similarity measure with complete linkage clustering using TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (version 3.11) software (Dudoit et al., 2003). A two-sample t-test based on 10,000 random permutations in the R packages was used to statistically analyze differentially expressed genes. The q-value package of the Bioconductor software was used to calculate q-values as a significance measure for the genes. Genes with a q-value of ＜ 0.05 and with a mean difference between two groups of ＞ 1.5 were selected.\n\nSamples containing 20 µg of either total non-tumor or tumor RNAs were fractionated on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2% formaldehyde and 50 mM MOPS, and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The hybridization and washing conditions were the same as those described by Kim et al. (2004). cDNA probes for the genes were obtained from 21C Frontier: The Center for Functional Analysis of the Human Genome (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology).\n\nCells were grown and transfected with either the GFP-tagged ANXA2 expression vector or an empty vector control on glass coverslips. Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously by Kim et al. (2004). Cells were examined under a laser-scanning microscope LCM510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The primary antibodies for ANXA2 (H50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and CD34 (ICO115, Santa Cruz, CA) were detected using secondary biotinylated antibody and a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. For double immunostaining, HRP-conjugated streptavidine staining for ANXA2 was carried out, and the peroxidase activity was detected using the enzyme substrate 3 amino-9-ethyl carbazole. Sequential alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated streptavidine staining for CD34 was visualized with the bromochloroindoylphosphate/nitrobluetetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) chromogen substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nAutoradiographs of Northern hybridizations were scanned using a LAS3000 system (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan), and densitometric data were analyzed. Differences in the gene expression levels between the groups were also calculated by normalizing the levels against the 18S expression level. All data were entered into Microsoft Excel 5.0, and GraphPad Software was used to analyze survival where appropriate. P values of ＜ 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nUsing cDNA microarray analysis, 40 tumors and corresponding non-tumor tissues were compared against a pool of 6 normal liver tissues. We selected all genes with less than 20% missing values and SD ＞ 0.5. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all the tissues was based on the similarity of the expression patterns for all genes (Figure 1A). All the tissue samples, except for two samples, were completely separated into the two main groups of non-tumor liver tissues (NT) and tumor tissues (T). Four distinctive clusters of genes were identified according to their delineation using the hierarchical clustering dendrogram. In the two major sample clusters, one representing HCC and the other representing nontumor tissues, genes with a q-value of ＜ 0.05 and with a mean difference of ＞ 1.5 between the two groups were selected. Of these 217 genes, 72 were expressed preferentially in the HCC tissues compared with the non-tumor tissues. Clustering of the non-tumor liver tissues revealed two subclasses having an association with liver cirrhosis Table 1 for the full list of genes in each cluster.\n\n(LC), with a few exceptions (Figure 1B). Cluster LC mainly contained samples from cases with liver cirrhosis and pre-cirrhotic septal fibrosis (88%). Analysis of the HCC cluster data also revealed 2 distinct subclasses among the 40 HCC cases (Figure 1C). These two subclasses exhibited strong associations with the Edmondson grades.\n\nCluster GI/II was associated with Edmondson grades I and II while cluster GIII/IV was associated with Edmondson grades III and VI. Evidently, genes differentially expressed between the premalignant liver cirrhosis and the well differentiated HCC act as early diagnostic markers for the onset of HCC, or as a molecular target for the develop- ment of HCC. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, genes with a q-value of ＜ 0.05 for LC (17 cases) and GI/II (14 cases) were selected. Compared with the liver cirrhosis samples, 51 out of 186 genes were upregulated in GI/II HCC while 135 genes were downregulated. The hierarchical clustering dendrogram identified 7 groups of genes according to the level of delineation. In Figure 1D these groups are listed in each cluster (Supplementary Table 1). The genes in cluster II contained various molecular chaperone genes, and the tumor-related genes were preferentially upregulated in the GI/II subclass, but somewhat downregulated in the LC subclass. Clusters I, III, IV, V and VI contained genes preferentially expressed in subclass LC and downregulated in subclass GI/II HCC. Tumor suppressor and apoptosis-related genes and genes related to the major histocompatibility complex were downregulated in clusters I and VI. The genes in cluster VII were heterogeneously upregulated in GI/II HCC. Liverspecific genes, in addition to genes related to the immune system, were also downregulated in cluster VI.\n\nSubclass GI/II contained all the Edmondson grades I and II samples (100%) while subclass GIII/IV contained a higher percentage of Edmondson grades III and IV samples (76.9%) (Table 1). There was a significant association between the subclass and patient survival. The median survival time in subclass GIII/IV was 15 months, whereas it was 60 months in subclass GI/II. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated a poorer survival (P = 0.01) for GIII/IV HCC patients than for GI/II HCC patients (Figure 2A). Serum AFP levels are believed to be related to the survival of HCC patients as higher serum AFP levels indicate a poorer survival (Izumi et al., 1992). In contrast, among the clinical indicators of HCC patients, serum AFP levels of ＞ 300 ng/ml did not show a significant association with survival (P = 0.26) (Figure 2B). Subclass III/IV consisted of the two major clusters of mixed (M) and poor differentiation (P). Five groups of genes, identified according to the level of delineation using the hierarchical clustering dendrogram (Figure 3), are listed in each cluster (Supplementary Table 2). Compared with GI/II HCC, 53 genes were upregulated in the poor differentiation cluster of subclass GIII/IV while 69 genes were downregulated. Gene cluster I contained the genes significantly upregulated in the P cluster of subclass GIII/IV and downregulated in subclass GI/II. Cluster I contained the tumor-or tumor progression-related genes, in addition to various metastasis-or invasion-related genes.\n\nCluster IV contained the liver specific genes. Cluster V contained the genes substantially upregulated in the P cluster of subclass GIII/IV and downregulated in subclass GI/II. These results indicate that the genes differentially expressed between subclasses GI/II and GIII/IV probably act as molecular markers for HCC progression, including metastasis and invasion.\n\nThe reliability of the microarray data and the robustness of the strategy for identifying genes showing altered expressions were examined. Expression levels of 6 randomly selected upregulated genes and the diubiquitin D (UBD) gene as a positive upregulated control, along with 7 downregulated genes from the 217 genes that were Figure 3. Specific gene subclusters within a hierarchical cluster of differentially expressed genes in subclass GIII/VI compared with subclass GI/II. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 14 GI/II HCC and 26 GIII/IV HCC samples. Subclass III/IV consisted of the two major clusters of mixed (M) and poor differentiation (P). Five gene subclusters within an unsupervised hierarchical cluster of GI/II and GIII/IV. See supplementary Table 2 for the full list of genes in each cluster.\n\ndifferently expressed in HCC and non-tumor liver tissues were examined using Northern blot analysis from 15 HCC and corresponding nontumor tissues. These genes represented an independent sample set that had been used in microarray studies (Figure S1). UBD was upregulated in 14 of 15 HCC tissue samples (93.3%) compared with matched non-tumor tissues. This result is in agreement with the previous report of Lee et al. (2003) in which G22P1 (Ku70) was preferentially overexpressed in 14 of 15 samples (93.3%) and DSCR1 was differentially underexpressed in all 15 samples (100%) of HCC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. The microarray data were further tested by randomly selecting genes that were differentially expressed in GI/II HCC and LC tissues and determining the mRNA expression levels of 3 normal liver (N), 3 cirrhotic liver (LC), 4 GI/II HCC, and 4 GIII/IV HCC tissues (Figure 4A). GPC3 expression was first examined in the HCC tissues as a positive control because it is overexpressed in HCC (Capurro et al., 2003).\n\nGPC3 was substantially overexpressed in the GI/II HCC tissues compared with the normal liver and LC tissues. The GPC3 expression level was much higher in the GIII/IV HCC tissues than in the GI/II HCC tissues. Ku70, PSMD4, HSPCB, and ATP1B1 were preferentially expressed in the GI/II HCC tissues compared with the normal liver and LC tissues. In contrast, the DUSP6, KPNA4, IGFBP3,\n\nNo. of No. of positive Tissue specimens cases (%) Non-tumor liver Hepatocytes 60 3 (5.0) Sinusoidal endothelial cells 60 21 (35.0)* Vascular endothelial cells 60 59 (98.3) in portal tract Bile ducts in portal tracts 60 59 (98.3) HCC Hepatocytes 60 30 (50.0) † Sinusoidal endothelial cells 60 52 (86.7) ‡\n\n*Focal immunostaining in ＜ 10% of the endothelial cells of the sinusoid in chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis.

Immunohistochemistry of ANXA2 in HCC versus nontumor tissues with normal findings, chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis.\n\nFOS, and DCN mRNA expression levels were downregulated in the GI/II HCC tissues compared with the LC tissues. The mRNA transcripts of the genes that distinguished between the GIII/IV and GI/II HCC tissues were then validated (Figure 4B). The liver specific genes INSIG1, PCK2, and HGD were downregulated in the GIII/IV HCC tissues compared with the GI/II tissues. These transcripts were upregulated compared with the normal liver and cirrhotic tissues. TMSB10, ANXA5, S100A6 and TMSB4X were upregulated in the GIII/IV tissues.\n\nWe observed that ANXA2 mRNA was preferentially overexpressed in all 15 HCC tissue samples (100%) examined (Figure 5A). Therefore, we examined the ANXA2 expression levels in paraffinembedded tissue sections obtained from 60 samples of HCC and 60 samples of nonmalignant liver tissues (Table 2). Positive staining in the endothelial cells of the sinusoid was observed in 52 of 60 (86.7%) HCC tissues. (Figure 5B, d-h) and in the malignant hepatocytes of 30 of 60 (50%) HCC tissues (Figure 5B, i and j). Positive ANXA2 immunoreactivity was consistent with the immunoreactivity of CD34 (Figure 5B, d, e, and f), which is a neovascularization marker in HCC. This indicates that ANXA2 is probably involved in tumor angiogenesis in HCC. Immunohistochemical staining of ANXA2 was rarely observed in hepatocytes from the 60 non-tumor liver tissues, which included normal, chronic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis (Figure 5B, a, b, and c) samples. The sinusoidal endothelial cells affected by chronic hepatitis showed no immunostaining or only focal immunostaining for ANXA2, similar to the results for CD34 immunostaining. Positive immunostaining for ANXA2 was always observed in vascular endothelial cells and in the bile duct epithelium in the portal areas of the non-tumor liver tissues (Figure 5B, c). ANXA2 staining was detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 5B, i) and/or along the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 5B, j) in malignant hepatocytes.\n\nNegative immunoreactivity for ANXA2 was observed in metastatic colon cancer to the liver (Figure 5B, k), whereas the granular immunoreactvity of ANXA2 in cholangiocarcinoma cells was detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 5B, l).\n\nOur results revealed that major clusters of both non-tumor and HCC tissues show a degree of heterogeneity within a gene expression profile. These clusters can be subdivided into either NC and LC subclasses in the non-tumor tissues or GI/II and GIII/IV subclasses in the HCC tissues according to histopathological characteristics. In contrast, other studies have reported that two distinct subclasses of HCC are weakly associated with the Edmondson grade according to hierarchical clustering gene expression patterns (Lee et al., 2004). Analysis of the clustered data in the gene expression profiles between the LC and GI/II subclasses revealed that cluster II contained various molecular chaperone genes, including CCT5, HSPCB, CCT3, HSPCA, DNAJB11, HSPB1, and TOMM20, which suggests that proteindamaging stress can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Many key components of the survival and apoptotic pathways are regulated by interactions with molecular chaperones, which are primarily members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families (Mosser and Morimoto, 2004). HSP70 (HSPCB) has been reported to be a sensitive marker for the differential diagnosis of early HCC from a precancerous lesion or a non-cancerous liver (Chuma et al., 2003). Cluster II also contained the tumor-related genes EFNA1, MDK, RBM17, FDPS, and p8 and the LASS2 anti-metastasis gene (Ree et al., 1999;Kato et al., 2000;Sampath et al., 2003;Fei et al., 2004;Pilarsky et al., 2004;Nakamura et al., 2005). Clusters I, III, IV, V, and VI contained the genes that were preferentially expressed in subclass LC and downregulated in subclass GI/II HCC. The tumor suppressor and apoptosis-related genes (STAT1, IGFBP7, THY28, and DDB1) (Landberg et al., 2001;Bontron et al., 2002;Jiang et al., 2003;Xi et al., 2006) and the genes related to the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-DRB3, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DRA) were downregulated in cluster I. The genes associated with the immune system were downregulated in cluster VI, which suggests that the deterioration of immune surveillance and apoptosis occurs at an early stage of HCC development. Other tumor suppressor genes, including COPEB, DUSP6, IGFBP3, ZFP36, SOD2, DSCR1, ARHE, and NPDC1 (Buckbinder et al., 1995;Galiana et al., 1995;Zhao et al., 2002;Furukawa et al., 2003;Stoecklin et al., 2003;Reeves et al., 2004;Villalonga et al., 2004;Hampton, 2005), were observed in cluster VI. Altered expressions of the COPEB and IGFBP3 genes have been reported in HCC (Hanafusa et al., 2002;Kremer-Tal et al., 2004). An analysis of the HCC cluster data revealed that the two distinct subclasses GI/II and GIII/IV are strongly associated with patient survival. Two upregulated gene clusters (I and V) and 3 downregulated clusters (II, III, and IV) were identified in subclasses GIII/IV of HCC. Cluster I contained the tumor-or tumor progression-related genes LAPTM5, CD74, UBE1L, PRG1, DKK1, and LAMB1 (Shen et al., 1997;Schafer et al., 1998;McLaughlin et al., 2000;Seimiya et al., 2003;Wirths et al., 2003;Hira et al., 2005). Cluster I also contained various metastasis-or invasion-related genes, including S100A11, S100A6, RGS19IP1, and TIMP2 (Weterman et al., 1992;Musso et al., 1997;Awan et al., 2002;Mori et al., 2004). The upregulated metastasis-related gene S100A4 (Garrett et al., 2006) and the tumor-associated gene TMSB10 (Alldinger et al., 2005) were also included in Cluster V. There was no significant association between the etiology of HCC and differential expression of the genes, probably due to the small number of HCC samples derived from etiologies other than HBV.\n\nANXA2, which is a substrate for kinases and a receptor for the tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen, is believed to be related to the metastasis of various tumors (Hajjar et al., 1994;Tanaka et al., 2004). Our results showed that ANXA2 was upregulated in all HCC tissues, suggesting that ANXA2 plays a role in HCC development and progression. HCC is a typical hypervascular tumor. Therefore, the specificity of the endothelial markers for distinguishing normal sinusoids from sinusoid-like tumor vessels in the liver is essential for describing tumor revasculariza-tion. Angiogenesis of sinusoidal capillarization is usually evaluated by determining the degree of CD34 expression. Our results showed that the immunoreactivity of ANXA2 is an effective method for evaluating the extent of angiogenesis and for distinguishing HCC from non-neoplastic liver tissue. The role of ANXA2 in neovascularization is not completely understood. However, the local plasmin formation induced by the S100A4/annexin II interaction on the surface of the activated endothelium probably contributes to tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastasis (Semov et al., 2005). Therefore, this protein complex might be another attractive target for new anti-cancer and antiangiogenic treatments in HCC if the treatment strategy is to protect the vascular endothelial cells and the bile ducts in the portal tract. ANXA2 expression in cholangiocarcinoma fails to distinguish cholangiocarcinoma from the normal epithelium of the bile duct because both highly express ANXA2.\n\nOur results indicate that ANXA2 expression might be a novel marker for angiogenesis in HCC. Array-based expression profiling can identify novel molecules to be used as markers for the genesis and progression of HCC, and can provide targets for new anticancer management strategies.\n\na P = 0.01 vs Group GI/II."
