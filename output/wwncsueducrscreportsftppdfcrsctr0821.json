    "abstract": "On the morning of the first day, industrial scientists presented five research problems. Students were divided into five teams to work on mathematical and statistical modeling problems presented. In contrast to neat, well-posed academic exercises that are typically found in coursework or textbooks, the workshop problems are challenging realworld problems that required the varied expertise and fresh insights of the group for their formulation, solution and interpretation. Each group spent the first eight days of the workshop investigating their project and reported their findings in half-hour public seminars on the final day of the workshop. This year's projects were Cardiovascular events associated with oral and IV-administered antibacterial agents Glaxo SmithKline",

Given the probability distribution function (PDF) p(w|β) satisfies the \"regularity\" condition\n\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to p(w|β), then the variance of any unbiased estimator of β must satisfy\n\nwhere the derivative is evaluated at the true value of β and the expectation is taken with respect to p(w|β) (see [2]).\n\nThe CRLB is useful in assessing the efficiency of unbiased estimators since no unbiased estimator can have lower variance than the CRLB.\n\nLet w = (w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ) be a sequence of random observations from a normal distribution with unknown mean µ, and known variance σ 2 . Then the PDF (also known as the likelihood) of w is\n\nWe would like to obtain an estimator that maximizes this likelihood. Since maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing its log, we obtain an estimator that maximizes the log likelihood, where\n\nTo maximize (4), we take the first derivative with respect to µ, set it equal to zero, and solve for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) μ as follows:\n\nNote that w is an unbiased estimator of µ, and V ar( w) = σ 2 n .\n\nThe CRLB of any unbiased estimator of µ is obtained by taking the reciprocal of the negative expectation of the second derivative of the log likelihood. In this example,\n\nThus, the V ar( ŵ) achieves the CRLB.\n\nIn this report, we will calculate the CRLB of estimates of position and velocity given angle-only measurements using two different approaches. First, we assume that the angle measurements are normally distributed and directly calculate the inverse information matrix. We include numerical simulations to check for bias in calculating the variance of the estimate. Second, we use the Kalman filter approach to obtain the CRLB. A comprehensive discussion on Kalman filter for discrete models can be found in [1].\n\nWhile the first approach calculates the CRLB at the end of each time segment, the second approach does this over the whole trajectory.\n\n2 Aircraft -Straight Line Trajectory Assume the aircraft is moving along a straight line with constant velocity. Let θ be an observed angle, and assume θ ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ). Then, the MLE of µ is µ = θ, and V ar( µ) = σ 2 . Thus, for angles, θ 1 , θ 2 , . . . , θ n , I -1 (µ) = σ 2      1 0 . . . 0 0 1 . . . 0 . . . . . . . . . 0 0 0 0 1\n\nwhere I -1 is the inverse information matrix for µ.

In order to find the CRLB for an estimator, V , of the velocity, V , we note that x i = V t i , so\n\n.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnd an estimator of the CRLB is obtained by taking\n\nWe assume θ i = tan -1 H x i + ε, where ε ∼ N (0, σ 2 ). Thus, the likelihood of the entire sample is\n\nThen,\n\nSince all terms not including x 1 would have derivatives equal to zero, we have\n\n1 + H 2 . This can be done for each individual x i . We set ∂l ∂x 1 = 0, we can solve for x1 , the maximum likelihood estimator of\n\n.\n\nNow, to find the Fisher's information we need to obtain the 2 nd derivatives.\n\nAgain, we can get the second derivative for each individual x i . Notice the first derivative is only a function of the x i that we are differentiating. Hence, all off diagonal derivatives are zeros. For example, consider the two measurement case:\n\nwhere\n\nSo, the information matrix will then have the form,\n\nThus,\n\nTherefore, for each measurement x i gives us the CRLB is given by\n\nHence, we can conclude the two approaches give the same results. Assume the aircraft is moving along a straight line with a constant velocity. In this case, however, we also assume we have two sensors measuring angles to the aircraft simultaneously. Let α be the angle measured by the first sensor and β be the angle measured by the second sensor for one position in time. Now, assume α ∼ N (µ α , σ 2 ) and β ∼ N (µ β , σ 2 ). Then, the MLE for µ α is μα = α, and the MLE for µ β is μβ = β. Also, the variances V ar(μ α ) = σ 2 and V ar(μ β ) = σ 2 achieve the CRLB. Thus,\n\nIn this case,\n\nwhere x α i is the measurement obtained by the first sensor, and\n\nwhere x β i is the measurement obtained by the second sensor.\n\nLet x i = (x α i + x β i )/2.

The CRLB is large when the aircraft is far from both sensors. As it approaches the 1st sensor, the CRLB decreases and is minimum over the first sensor. As it moves away towards the second sensor, it increases but it is then balanced by the second sensor at the midpoint between the two sensors. Then it decreases and is minimum over the second sensor.\n\nFigure 4: The CRLB for an unbiased estimate of the velocity of a straight line trajectory using two sensors at time t 0 = 0. The sensors's are placed at positions (0,0) and (0,10).\n\n3 Missile\n\nFigure 5: Two angle measurements, θ 1 and θ 2 , taken by a single sensor (at times t 1 and t 2 , respectively), of ballistic trajectory, given initial velocity vector\n\nThe motion of the missile is governed by the following equations:\n\nIn this case, V x and V y are the horizontal and vertical components (respectively) of the initial velocity, and x 0 and y 0 are the horizontal and vertical components (respectively) of the initial position of the missile.\n\nHere we assume that x 0 = 0, and y 0 = 0.\n\nThe relationship between the angle measurement (at any point in time) and the position of the missile is\n\nAgain we assume that θ i ∼ N (µ i , σ 2 ), where\n\nThus, the likelihood is\n\nTaking the log of the likelihood, we obtain\n\nLet θ = (θ 1 , θ 2 , . . . , θ n ).

The general method is to set exact positions and velocities for the object, calculate the exact angle, perturb the angle with Gaussian noise, and then try to calculate the position or velocity of the object using this new data. Depending on the particular situation, varying numbers of measurements are needed to compute the position and velocity data. In this section, we summarize the method used in each particular case, discuss any results of significance, and discuss the limitations of each case. All cases in this section are in the two-dimensional setup. The methods discussed in this section to determine the positions and velocities of the objects were derived so that exact angle measurements would result in the calculation of the exact positions and velocities.\n\nThis first case is the case where we are trying to track an object in level flight (constant altitude and velocity) using a single sensor. To start with, we want to try to determine the position of the object using only one measurement. In general, this is not possible, as the sensor only measures an angle, so the object could be at any point along a ray extending outward from the sensor determined by the angle measured. Therefore, we add the assumption that we know the altitude of the object through some other means. The Monte Carlo simulations are used to try to determine the variance of the position measurements obtained in this way. The following method is used:\n\n1. Set a position for the object, and determine the exact angle measurement using θ = tan -1 (H/x), or taking θ = π/2 if x = 0, 2. Perturb the angle measurement using Gaussian noise, with some known variance (we take σ 2 = 0.001), 3. Calculate the observed position of the object, using x = H cot(α), where α is the perturbed angle.\n\nThis procedure is performed for a very large number of observations at each given object position, and then the mean and variance of the measurements can easily be calculated with this data. In Figure 9, the mean of x-x is plotted as a function of the number of iterations for x = 0, 2000, 4000, 8000, with H = 1000. For x = 0, the mean of x-x is zero, but as x increases, this mean also increases. Therefore, in general, this is not an unbiased estimator, so we do not expect this to achieve the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound.\n\nIn Figure 10, the ratio of the calculated variance and the theoretical bound is plotted as a function of the number of observations n, for x positions x = 0, 2000, 4000, 8000, with H = 1000 fixed. Notice that the calculated variance diverges more and more from the calculated bound as the x position increases, which corresponds with the actual and observed angles becoming smaller and smaller. One significant contribution to the variance for the larger values of x is that the observed angle, if it lies outside three or four standard deviations from the actual angle, may be negative, which causes the observed x position to be considerably negative. For smaller x values, the angle is quite large, so such an occurrence would be very rare.\n\nIn Figure 11, the ratio of the calculated variance and the theoretical bound is plotted as a function of the number of observations n, with fixed angle θ = π/4 and H = x = 1, 10, 100, 1000.\n\nIn this case, we are trying to observe the velocity of an object in level flight, using only one sensor. Once again, we include the assumption that we know the altitude of the object, so only two measurements are required to calculate a velocity observation. We assume that there is a certain amount of time ∆t between observations, which is known, and that the timing is exact, so there is no error introduced by the timing mechanism. Thus, the following procedure is used:\n\n1. Set exact positions x 1 and x 2 for the object, where x 2 = x 1 + V ∆t, V is the exact velocity, 2. Determine the exact angle measurements θ 1 and θ 2 , where θ i = tan -1 (H/x i ) or θ i = π/2 if x i = 0, for i = 1, 2, 3. Perturb the angle measurements using Gaussian noise, with some known variance, 4. Calculate the observed positions of the object, using xi = H cot(α i ) for i = 1, 2, where the α i are the observed angle measurements, 5. Calculate the observed velocity of the object, using V = (x 2 -x1 )/∆t. This procedure is performed for a large number of measurements for each given set of exact data, and the mean and variance of the observed data are calculated.\n\nIn Figure 12, the variance of the calculated velocity is plotted as a function of the number of observations, where the altitude is H = 1000, the exact velocity is V = 2000, the timestep is dt = 1, and x 1 = 0, 2000 respectively. The mean values of the calculated velocities are not the same as V , so this method creates a biased estimator. The variance increases as x 1 increases, which is expected due to earlier results. In Figure 13, the calculated variance of the velocities are plotted against the number of iterations, where x 1 = 0 and H = 1000 are fixed, and the timestep and exact velocity are varied. The variance decreases as V is decreased and dt is increased.\n\nIn this case, we try to observe the exact position of an object in level flight, using only one sensor. We want to compute the coordinates of the object as well as its vertical and lateral velocities, so four angle measurements are needed. The following linear system is to be solved to determine these values:\n\nIf the angle measurements were exact, this yields the correct values. However, it is highly sensitive to the perturbations, especially when the angles are close together, as the signs of the expressions in the second column of the matrix may have different signs when the observed angles are used as opposed to when the exact angles are used. Thus, the observed variance in this case is far greater than the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound.\n\nIn addition, this particular method would not be ideal for tracking purposes, as it calculates the data at time t i using the information from t i , t i+1 , t i+2 , and t i+3 , so the data is three time-steps old by the time it is computed.\n\nIn this case, we attempt to observe the lateral position and altitude of an object using two sensors which are a known distance d apart from each other. This observation is independent of the trajectory of the object. The object's location is the intersection of the rays extending from each sensor along the observation angles, so a triangle is formed by the object and the two sensors. For the purposes of this section, the angles measured by the sensors are the interior angles of the triangle. We assume that the measurements are taken at exactly the same time. The following procedure is used: 1. Set exact position (x, y) of the object, 2. Calculate exact angle measurements θ 1 = tan -1 (y/x) and θ 2 = tan -1 (y/(d -x)), with θ 1 = π/2 if x = 0 or θ 2 = π/2 if x = d, where the subscripts correspond to a sensor located at (0, 0) and a sensor at (d, 0), respectively, 3. Independently perturb each of the angles using a Gaussian distribution with known variance, 4. Calculate the observed position of the object using x = d sin(α 2 ) cos(α 1 )/ sin(α 1 + α 2 ), and ŷ = d sin(α 2 ) sin(α 1 )/ sin(α 1 + α 2 ).\n\nThis procedure is performed for a large number of measurements for each given set of exact data, and the mean and variance of the observed data are calculated.\n\nIn Figure 14, the variance of the lateral position is plotted as a function of the number of observations, with a fixed exact altitude, and with x = 50, 100, 150, 200. Notice that the variance is smallest when the object is directly over one of the sensors, and then increases as the object gets farther away from where the sensors are. In Figure 15, we plot the variance of the vertical coordinate with respect to the number of iterations, using the same circumstances as in Figure 14. The variance of the vertical position is least when the object is exactly between the two sensors, and increases as the object gets farther away from that point. One of measurements used in Figures 14 and 15 appears to be unbiased. This occurs when the object is directly in between the two sensors. In all other situations, it is fairly clear that bias is involved. This setup experiences very large variances when θ 1 +θ 2 is either close to 0 or close to π, as the perturbations can cause sin(α i ) (for i = 1 or i = 2) or sin(α 1 + α 2 ) to become negative.\n\nThe Kalman filter is used to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It has a wide range of engineering applications, especially in control systems applications. It is a recursive process where the estimated state from the previous time step and the current measurement are used to get the estimates of state in the current time step. It is based on dynamical systems linearized in the time-domain. For the present problem, the underlying dynamics is non-linear. In this case, we use the extended Kalman Filter to estimate the states. The extended method is akin to a Taylor series where the estimation is linearized around the current estimate using the partial derivatives of the process and measurement function.\n\nTracking the position and velocity of a vehicle using sensor(s) capable of angle only measurements is not as accurate as range capable sensors. One would need to find bounds on the estimates of position and velocity with the assumption that the vehicle is flying with constant velocity, as in the case of an aircraft, or in a ballistic trajectory, as in the case of a missile. The CRLB provides the desired bound on the variance estimates of a series of measurements. Tracking the states of the vehicle can be improved by employing two or three sensors. The CRLB can be applied to determine the degree of improvement if we increase the number of sensors.\n\nIn the following discussion, we first model the discrete dynamics of a flight vehicle and then develop the governing equations relating the angle measured by the sensor(s) with the states of the vehicle.\n\nLet us denote the state vector at the k th time step by z k and the measured angle by θ k . Using the following relation, we can get the state vector at the k th time step, given the state vector at the (k -1) th step, by\n\nwhere z k is the state vector, F k is the state transition matrix, and w k is the process noise, which in our case is set to zero assuming the fact that the dynamics of the system is modeled accurately.\n\nThe angle measured by the sensor, at the k th time step, as a function of the state vector of the vehicle is given by\n\nwhere θ k is the angle vector measured made by the sensor(s), v k is the measurement noise, and h k is the nonlinear measurement function.\n\n• Case 1: Vehicle moving with a constant horizontal velocity in a straight line Let us assume that the height, h, at which the vehicle is flying is known and does not change with time. Also assume that the vehicle is flying with zero vertical velocity. The state vector at the time index k is given by z k = x k ẋk and the state transition matrix is given by F k = 1 ∆T 0 1 , where ∆T is the time interval of the angle measurement.\n\nWe assume that we have one sensor positioned at the origin. So, θ k = θ k , and the measurement function is given by h k = tan -1 y k x k . • Case 2: Vehicle moving in a ballistic trajectory Assuming that the acceleration in horizontal direction is zero, the state vector at the time index k is given by z k = x k ẋk y k ẏk 1 , and the state transition matrix is given by\n\n, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nDepending on the number of sensors that are employed, the angle observation matrix θ k can be a scalar or a vector. We assume here that in case of multiple sensors, the sensors are placed in the same horizontal plane equally spaced from the origin. Let s be the number of sensors and d i be the distance of the i th sensor from the origin. The measurement vector is given by θ k = θ 1 k . . . θ s k and the nonlinear measurement function is given by\n\n. In our case, we are assuming that d 1 = 0, i.e. the first sensor is at the origin.\n\nIn this sub-section we give the Kalman Filter for our model. A Kalman filter works in an iterative loop. So, the first stage is the Time Update, where we use the estimates of the state and error covariance calculated from the earlier time step to predict the state and error co-variance matrix. We denote the prediction stage by superscript minus. The next stage in the loop is the Measurement Update in which we update the estimates from the measured data. Assuming that we know the initial estimate for the state matrix, ẑk-1 and the error co-variance matrix , P k-1 the time update stage is governed by the following equations:\n\nThe next step utilizes the predicted estimates from the last step to update the state estimates as follows:\n\n• Measurement Update\n\nwhere K k is the Kalman gain, and H k is the Jacobian of h k evaluated at the true state z k ,i.e.\n\nUsing the updated state and co-variance matrix at the k th time step we go back to the time update stage and predict the states and co-variance matrix for the (k + 1) th time step. These above steps are repeated to get the estimates on the states of the projectile.\n\nWe direct our readers to [3] for an explanation of derivation of the bound. The diagonal elements of the inverse information matrix gives us the CRLB of the state vector components, i.e.,\n\nwhere n is the number of elements in the state vector. The information matrix J k can be calculated using the iteration:\n\nwhere J 0 = P -1 0 and P 0 = I n×n .\n\nFor Case 1, the Jacobian of h k is given by\n\n0 , whereas for Case 2, it is given by\n\nWe use the theory developed in the previous subsection for our numerical simulations. Here we present the results obtained for the two cases that have been discussed earlier. We have taken the initial state vector for the first case to be z 0 = -10 100 and for the second case it is z 0 = -10 100 0 100 1 . Also in order to find the variance in the measurement noise, we have taken σ = 0.003. The time interval of the measurement is taken to be 0.25s. As stated earlier, we have used one sensor to estimate the states of the flight vehicle in the first case. In the second case we have considered using one, two and three sensors to compute the bounds on the variance in the states. The first sensor is placed at the origin and the other sensors are placed at 100 units apart, i.e. d 1 = 0, d 2 = 100 and d 3 = 200. We compare the accuracy of the results as we increase the number of sensors to estimate the states.\n\nWe assume that we know the initial state vector of the vehicle. Using the dynamics of the vehicle, we can simulate the trajectory of the vehicle as a function of time. We call that trajectory true data. Using the actual states of the vehicle, we calculate the elevation angle and add Gaussian noise to it in order to simulate the actual angle measured by the sensors.\n\n• Case 1: Vehicle moving with a constant horizontal velocity in a straight line\n\nIn this case, we know the actual height of the vehicle and we are trying to estimate the bounds on the variance of V x and X. With the increase in time, the vehicle moves further away from the sensor and it becomes difficult to estimate the velocity of the vehicle. This fact is elucidated in Figure 16, where we see a constant rise in the bound with the increase in time. However, since the horizontal velocity is constant, the bound decreases as we increase the number of observations. 29 • Case 2: Vehicle moving in a ballistic trajectory\n\nIn Figure 17, we compare the trajectories obtained from the dynamics of the vehicle and the ones predicted by the sensors. We observe that even with one sensor, we are able to track the actual trajectory very well. The CRLB for the variance of V x , as can be seen from Figure 18, is of order 10 -1 whereas for V y it is of order 10. We know that for a parabolic trajectory the horizontal velocity remains constant whereas the vertical velocity changes linearly with time. Since the horizontal velocity is constant, the CRLB is achieved in fewer observations than the vertical velocity. Also it can be noted that the bound for V x is as low as 0.9 even with one sensor in the beginning whereas for V y it is of order 10 with one sensor initially. It is clear that as we increase the number of sensors the bounds on the velocity estimates decreases in both cases. The comparison of the bound in X and Y , Figure 19, shows the similar pattern with the increase in the number of sensors. We see a hump in the plot for Y at k = 40 which corresponds to V y = 0 in our case. The hump decreases as we increase the number of sensors from one to two. With one sensor the bound on X is of order 100 and keeps on increasing, which can be explained from the fact that as time increases the vehicle moves away from the sensor(s). A minor variation in the angle measured results in a large variation in X. However with more sensors the bound decreases.  Figure 19: CRLB of variance of X and Y for a missile trajectory using Kalman Filter\n\nWith regards to the theoretical derivations of the CRLB for straight line trajectory with constant velocity, we found that the height is unobservable because scaling of height and velocity preserves angle measurement (e.g. height H and velocity V x result in the same angle as height 2H and velocity 2V x ). In the case of one sensor and a missile trajectory, we need at least two measurements to calculate the CRLB for the two components of the initial velocity. In general, the more parameters we need to get CRLB's for, the more measurements we need to collect. Additionally, we found that the CRLB increases as the object (aircraft/missile) gets farther away from the sensor, and that having more sensors decreases the CRLB.\n\nThrough the Monte Carlo simulations, we have confirmed numerically that the variance of the calculated position increases as the object travels farther away from the sensor(s). We have also discovered that the particular methods used result in the average calculated position itself becoming more distant from the correct position as the object travels farther away. In the limited testing done, it also appears that the addition of more sensors can reduce the variance and error in the calculated position, as well as allowing the calculation of position without the assumption of a known position component (altitude) which was required for the single sensor case. Additionally, we found that calculating positions and velocities for an object traveling in a ballistic trajectory using a single sensor is highly sensitive to the measured angles, and as such gives very poor results.\n\nThe implementation of the extended Kalman filter to extract the Fisher information matrix proved to be a very useful method for calculating the CRLB. The filter itself is very simple to code and does not require much computational power to attain reasonable accuracy. Along with being computationally inexpensive, the method is also easily adapted to more complex trajectories and multiple sensors. This added flexibility allows us to not only calculate the CRLB of these scenarios, but to also quantify any improvements that different configurations yield over the original one-sensor straight-line case. However, it is important to remember that these calculations are dependent on the particular filter being implemented. In our case, we are using the extended Kalman filter because of the small computational cost and flexibility mentioned above. Any other filtering method will produce a different estimation of the state vector over the trajectory in question and thus a different set of CRLBs for the state components. Further, this method of calculating the CRLB is also dependent upon the trajectory itself. An example of this dependence can be seen in Figure 19, which displays the CRLB for the position components of the state vector for an object following a ballistic trajectory. It can be seen that the bound for the x component of the state vector is monotonically increasing with time, as oppose to approaching a limit. This is attributed to the fact that the variance of an angle-only measurement of an object's position is proportional to the distance the object is from the sensor. A second example of this phenomenon is seen in the plot of the CRLB for the y component of the state vector. This figure shows that the CRLB increases and decreases as the object ascends and descends along the ballistic path. One last important remark comes from the attempt to unite the analytical and filtering approaches.\n\nAs discussed above, the filtering approach relies on an estimation of an entire trajectory and thus arrives at a CRLB for the entire trajectory. This is in contrast to the analytical approach, where the CRLB was calculated for only one instance of time using an unbiased estimator for the angle in question. In an effort to reconcile the two approaches one could try to formulate a recursion relation for the Fisher information matrix but evaluated at only one angle. However, such a task was outside our ability considering the amount of time given and thus lies in the realm of future work.\n\nIn this report we assumed the angle measurements are a noisy sample from a Gaussian distribution. Future research could perhaps explore other distributions, or even a truncated Gaussian since the the the angle measurements do not span the entire real line. Additionally, we recommend studying the bias of the estimated position and estimated velocity as well as exploring other types of bounds (in addition to the CRLB) on the variance of those estimates. Another area of possible future research is finding the minimum number of observations required in order to achieve a specified reduction in the error of the estimate. Of course, making the assumptions more realistic is another area that could be improved upon. For instance, we assume the aircraft is flying in a straight-line trajectory and constant velocity, when in reality that is not case.\n\nNancy Chalmers 1 , Giulio Genovese 2 , Adarsh Joshi 3 , Yogesh Joshi 4 , Jeff Stanley 5 , Justin Wright 6 , Shuxin Yin 7\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires clinical studies to evaluate the potential of a drug to prolong ventricular repolarization. The right side of the human heart is responsible for collecting deoxygenated blood, in the atrium, from the body and pumping it, through the right ventricle, into the lungs where blood is reoxygenated. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood, in the atrium, from the lungs and pumps it, through the ventricle, to the body.\n\n1 University of South Carolina 2 Dartmouth College 3 Texas A&M University 4 New Jersey Institute of Technology 5 Texas A&M University 6 Bloomsburg University 7 Auburn University 2\n\nThe pumping of the heart is mediated by electrical stimulation of the muscles. This stimulation can be measured using an electrocardiograph that measures the electrical activity of the heart over time. The ECG measures voltage changes between electrodes which are positioned in different places on the body. Typically, these electrical signals are measured using three electrodes (leads I, II, III) placed at different locations, see Figure 1. These leads are all bipolar leads, i.e., they contain one positive electrode and one negative electrode.  A typical ECG of normal cardiac cycles consists of a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and sometimes a U wave, see Figure 2. The P wave denotes normal atrial depolarization (contraction) where the main electrical vector spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. The QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the ventricles. The T wave represents the repolarization (relaxation) of the ventricles. The U wave, when present, shows the repolarization of the papillary muscles. Of interest here are two intervals. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves (the inverse of the heart rate). The QT interval, the time between the beginning of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave, represents the total time needed to depolarize and repolarize the ventricles.\n\nFDA regulations require clinical studies to evaluate how a new drug affects ventricular repolarization. This evaluation includes testing the influence of the drug on the QT interval. A prolonged QT interval may lead to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. In order to determine whether prolongation has occurred, the FDA regulations require a specific method to assess whether the QT has increased by more than 10 milliseconds (ms). The FDA requirements state that there must be at least 90 seconds of stable heart rate, meaning fluctuation of no more than 2 beats per minute (bpm). After this stable period, the experimenter chooses three similar QT intervals and the mean or median of these values is calculated. After any triplicate, at least 30 seconds must pass before the next candidate triplicate can be identified. Additional clinical trials may be required if these regulations are not met.\n\nIn this study, the goal is to measure RR and QT intervals to characterize the joint distribution and the relationship between the RR and the QT intervals. We also propose a similarity measure, a quantitative method to select beats according to the FDA beat selection rule. This includes identifying beats in the ECGs that are similar. In Section 2, we will provide some details about the ECG databases used for analysis. Section 3 describes algorithms used for analyzing the data, similarity measures, and confidence intervals. Results are presented in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5.\n\nThe ECG data for this study came from two sources: the QT Database [3], and the PTB Database [4]. The QT Database contains a total of 105 fifteen-minute excerpts of two-lead ECGs. These ECGs were collected from several sources: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, the European Society of Cardiology ST-T Database, and databases from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [5]. From this database, we extracted 15 normal ECGs from healthy adults. Data in the PTB database was collected by the National Metrology Institute of Germany, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). This database contains a total of 549 records from 290 subjects of 15-lead ECGs. The 15 leads include the 12 conventional leads and 3 Frank XYZ leads. This database contains 81 normal records from 52 healthy subjects. In our study, we analyzed 60 viable records from 40 different patients. The 32 men range in age from 17 to 68 with a mean of 39 years old. The 8 women range in age from 22 to 67 with a mean of 39 years old. Ten of these patients had more than one record.\n\nThis section describes the algorithms used to extract information from the databases. Algorithms include the detection of the RR and the QT intervals, and a history algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss our proposed similarity measure and present our calculation of confidence intervals.\n\nTo compute the length of the RR and QT intervals, we used an automated approach. Every record was analyzed using the program ecgpuwave [6] which includes a QRS detector and waveform limit locator. The program takes a single lead from a record and outputs annotations for the R peak, the Q onset, the T-wave offset, and other locations we were not interested in for purposes of the current study. From these automated annotations the length of the RR interval and the QT intervals were computed. This algorithm was not very reliable for the sequences obtained from the QT database, measured at 250 Hz. Thus we decided to use only the normal subjects from the PTB database, who were sampled at a much higher resolution of 1000 Hz. Among these sequences, some were noisy and had some missing annotations, so we kept only 60 of the 81 original records from the PTB database.\n\nFor the heartbeats annotated in each record, the algorithm uses the RR interval to determine the beat-to-beat heart rate in beats per minute. Using this heart rate, the algorithm searches retrospectively to find previous heartbeats that are within 2 bpm of the current heartbeat, as per FDA guidelines. The RR intervals, which represent the time between the heartbeats, are then added for the beats within 2 bpm to determine the heart rate history.\n\nAs previously stated, the FDA regulations require that a representative beat be chosen by first finding three adjacent beats that are \"similar\" and then choosing either the median or the average of the triplet. However, the FDA rule does not define the notion of \"similarity\" in a formal way. We define two beats to be \"similar\" when they have little difference in the shapes of their ECG recordings while still allowing for random noise associated with recording the electrical activity of the heart. Our criterion of \"similarity\" also allows for some differences in magnitude that may not be attributable to actual differences in the heart's electrical activity.\n\nBecause algorithms that determine the QT interval are still inaccurate, there are often outlier QT intervals contained within the beat sequence. Before considering adjacent beats, these outlier intervals must be removed from the data sequence. That is, if an outlier exists between two beats the outlier is removed and the remaining beats are considered adjacent.\n\nBecause the ECG data are noisy, they are smoothed to ensure that the similarity measure only captures differences in the overall trend in the ECG records. We use the median filter smoother with window size for the smoothing. Consider two adjacent beats Y i and Y i+1 where Y i =[y i,1 , y i, 2 , … , y i,j , … , y i,n ] and Y i+1 =[ y i+1,1 , y i+1,2 , … , y i+1,j , … , y i+1,m ] after filtering. Here, y i,1 and y i+1,1 are the values for the onset of the Q wave and y i,n and y i+1,m are the offset of the T wave as detected by the algorithm. Then we define the difference, ∆ j =y i,j -y i+1,j .\n\nInitially a simple sum of squared differences was used to detect similar adjacent beats. That is beat sequences with the smallest values for (1) were considered the most similar. Summing the differences over the min(m,n) rather than the maximum of the two is done to avoid an arbitrary choice of values for the shorter sequence beyond its T-wave offset. It should also be noted that similar beats have approximately the same length, while dissimilar beats will have a greater length difference. Since there is some variability in the length of the QT interval, this measure from equation ( 1) gave an undesired high score to beat sequences with longer QT intervals. Hence, the scaling factor min(m,n) was included to eliminate this problem. This adjustment yields the statistic Next, vertical adjustment to beats was considered. The goal of this adjustment was to prevent adjacent beats, in which the signal's values increased, from being considered dissimilar unless the change was significant. The first adjustment made was to vertically align the beats at the point of the Q wave onset.\n\nFor example if y i+1,1 were greater than y i,1 then Y i+1 '= Y i+1 -(y i+1,1 -y i,1 ) and the statistic would be calculated for Y i and Y i+1 ' . The second and third adjustments considered were vertical adjustments by the mean and median difference between two adjacent beats. That is Y i+1 '=Y i+1 -mean(∆ j ) or Y i+1 '=Y i+1 -median(∆ j ) and again the statistic would be calculated for Y i and Y i+1 '. These vertical adjustments rarely affected which beat sequences were selected as the best for consideration as a representative beat but they did allow for some obviously dissimilar beats to be considered as better choices than sequences that had small vertical differences before the adjustment. Hence the vertical adjustment was deemed unnecessary.\n\nThe next problem considered was that from sample to sample there is a difference in the scale of the beats, that is the amplitude of the ECG was larger for some subjects that the others. To correct this, the statistic is scaled by || Y i ||. So if K=min(m,n), the statistic becomes (2)\n\nIn order to determine confidence intervals for the upper bound of the across-record time difference, we applied the classic repeated measurement model, where • τ i is the i th across-record time effect ( );\n\n• β j is the j th within-record time effect ( );\n\n• (τβ) ij is the interaction of the i th across-record time effect and j th within-record time effect ( );\n\n• π k(i) is the random effect of k th subject nested within i th across-record time . The random variables are assumed to follow a normal distribution N(0,σ π ²); • (βπ) jk(i) is the random joint interaction effect of k th subject and j th within-record time nested within i th across-record time;\n\n• ε ijk is the random error term which is assumed to follow a normal distribution N(0,σ²), and k = 1,…,n i ; • the π k(i) , (βπ) jk(i) , and ε ijk are mutually independent.\n\nIn this model, we are interested in whether the across-record time effect τ i is significant or not.\n\nWhen studying normal variation in ECGs, it is essential to explore the statistical properties of the RR and the QT interval lengths. Figure 3 shows the medians and standard deviations for RR and QT by the age and gender of the patient. The RR median plot (Figure 3 top left) shows that there is no significant correlation between RR interval length and age. The average heart rate for these patients is about 900 ms. It is well known that the variability of heart rate decreases with age, see e.g. Reardon and Malik [7]. Our analysis confirms this trend as shown in Figure 3 (top right). RR interval standard deviation and age have a correlation of -0.10. The average heart rate variability is about 40 ms. The female outlier in this plot will be discussed later.\n\nThe properties of the QT interval are not as well documented as the RR interval. From the QT median plot shown in Figure 3 (bottom left), the average QT interval is around 400 ms. The correlation between the QT interval and age is 0.19, implying that the QT interval increases slightly with age. The QT standard deviation plot shows no significant correlation with age. The average standard deviation for these patients is about 5 ms, much smaller than the heart rate variability of the same patients. The top two plots in Figure 4 show the length of the of RR and QT intervals from two patients' records. The plot on the top left is a typical plot from a normal subject, having very low correlation between RR and QT length. The plot on the top right is another patient who is considered normal by the categorization currently used. This plot shows that this patient's heart beats in three different modes. This patient is also the female outlier in the RR standard deviation plot from Figure 3 (top left). The ECG from this patient is depicted in Figure 4 (bottom right). This subject is a typical case of arrhythmia. The differences in heart rate duration are clearly visible. However, the difference in the QT interval lengths is small. This causes the three different modes in the scatterplot. Using current methods, this patient is classified as normal, but using our method we can clearly classify this individual as having an arrhythmia. As you can see from these scatterplots, statistical features of the QT interval on the order of 10 ms (the FDA criterion) were actually captured by the QT detection algorithm. Figure 5 shows the relationship between RR and QT for all 60 records. Analysis of these results shows that the correlation within an individual is very low, as evident in the plot from Figure 4 (top left). Despite this, the correlation between RR and QT median among subjects (Figure 5 left) is 0.82. Based on the coefficient of determination, 67% of the variation in QT interval median length is explained by the relationship with RR interval median length. The coefficient of variation plot (Figure 5 right) shows that there is no significant correlation between heart rate variability and QT interval variability.\n\nThe RR intervals, which represent the time between the heartbeats, are added for the beats within 2 bpm to determine the heart rate history. Once the history data was calculated, an analysis was done to examine the distributional properties. Histograms depicted in Figure 6 show that the data is overdispersed at 0, from patient 233, a 24 year old male and from patient 131, a 26 year old male. The maximum history for any heartbeat from any individual in the database is 61.30 seconds. This is still far below the FDA criteria of 90 seconds, which indicates that in order to use normal ECG data, the FDA would need to either increase the stability requirement to a time greater than 2 seconds or decrease the requirement on the length of the history needed to identify candidate points. Figure 6 (top right) shows the distribution of the histories for the three records for patient 233. Studies have shown that heart rate variability decreases with age. Typically, the FDA uses healthy, young subject who should be more variable. Because there are many previous studies examining heart rate variability, the focus of this study will instead be on the FDA criteria for history length. A visual analysis of the histograms for the histories of the ten patients with multiple records showed that eight seconds appeared to be a reasonable cutoff for the heart rate stability criteria. For the data analyzed, a total of 28 of the 60 total records contained at least one candidate triple using the eight second criteria. Figure 7 shows a histogram of the number of candidate triples for these 28 records. Note that a majority of the records contain fewer than ten candidates. The second part of the FDA criteria for history is that successive candidate points must be at least 30 seconds apart, but analysis shows that this will not work for the data analyzed in this study. Secondary intervals were calculated between candidate points to find a more appropriate time to use to determine separation between successive candidate points for normal data. Multiple time intervals were considered and weighed before a 10 second successive interval was settled upon. Longer time intervals showed few secondary candidates while shorter intervals were considered to be too short to provide adequate separation between the candidates. The 10 second successive candidate interval yields 18 records from 16 patients with at least one successive candidate. Two patients have two records each with successive candidate points. No record showed more than 7 candidate points by the criteria. Figure 8 shows the lengths of the RR versus the QT intervals with each colored symbol representing a different patient. The RR and the QT lengths tend to be fairly stable across the record for each patient, with the exception of patients 182, a 28 year old male, and 263, a 37 year old male. Using the FDA criteria for selection of triplets, the 60 normal ECG records from the PTB database would contain no potential triplets. The modification to require the previous 8 seconds to be stable and at least 10 seconds between triplets, however, yields 28 records with at least one potential triplet. Of these, 18 records, from 16 patients, have a total of 57 potential triplets.\n\nBefore analyzing similarity, outliers in the patient's heart rate sequence must be removed. Figure 9 shows QT intervals for patient 470. The red dots represent intervals considered to be outliers, and hence must be removed before similarity analysis. The next issue is to determine which criterion should be used to line up the waves before similarity analysis. Figure 10 shows triplicate adjacent beats before any adjustment (left) and after vertically adjusting the curves based on the Q wave onset (right). The s statistic, in equation ( 2) performs well and consistently across a variety of sample ECG readings, despite the fact that a large degree of variation in the beat characteristics exists between samples. Figure 11 shows the beat sequence selected as the best (left) as well as a sequence from the 75 th percentile of the s statistic (right) for two samples. The beats have been overlaid for easy comparison and have been displayed without the median filter. The beat sequences chosen as the best for each sample data set were not affected by the addition of the median filtering process while the process did re-rank sequences after the 45th percentile of the s statistic. From the histograms in Figure 12, the distribution of the similarity measure has the same shape for multiple samples. This means that our similarity measure is a consistent measure. We can also conclude that the similarity measure has a similar value for most triples and will select bad triples as outliers.\n\nThe FDA rejects drugs if the QT intervals differ by more than 10 ms, but for the normal ECG data this may not be a good criterion for assessment. In order to evaluate this, an analysis was done to compare normal ECG data across time, both within an individual record and across multiple records for a patient. From the data, there were six patients in the PTB database with two records containing candidate triplets according to the modified criteria. These patients ranged in age from 26 to 47 including 5 males and 1 female. From this data, an analysis was done to determine differences within a patient across time and to find a 95% confidence interval for the upper bound of the difference.\n\nTo begin the analysis, normality and independence were assumed and the sphericity condition (S) was checked. Table 1 shows that the data satisfy the (S) condition, so the repeated measures design can be used to analyze the data.\n\nDF Criterion Chi-Square Pr>Chisq Transformed Variates 5 0.2688 10.4577 0.0500 Orthogonal Components 5 0.5614 5.3592 0.4115 Table 1: Output from the test for sphericity. P-value of 0.4115 for the orthogonal components shows that the data satisfy the sphericity condition.\n\nA repeated measures design was performed. Results are shown in Table 2. This shows that there is no across-record time difference.\n\nacross-record time effect 0.04 0.8447 within-record time effect 0.39 0.7600 interaction of the across-record time effect and within-record time effect 0.12 0.9504 Table 2: Output from the one-way ANOVA. P-value of 0.8447 shows that there is no across-record time effect. This is the only P-value of interest for these confidence intervals.\n\nNext, a 95% confidence interval can be constructed for the upper bound of the across-record time difference. Using the 12 records described above, a 95% confidence interval of the upper bound for across-record time differences is (1.62, 10.05). If we had ECG data for a drug and a control, we could use this confidence interval method to determine whether the drug had a significant effect on the QT interval.\n\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the variation in ECGs from healthy subjects measured during rest using the FDA regulations. We found that heart rate variability decreases with age and that the length of the QT interval increases slightly with age. Comparing variability, the QT standard deviation (5 ms) is much smaller than the RR standard deviation (40 ms), meaning that QT intervals are less variable than RR intervals. Using the coefficient of variation, the QT intervals are still less variable than the RR intervals. We also observed that RR and QT correlation is very low within a normal individual, while the correlation is fairly high among subjects. Our method is capable of detecting differences in the QT interval on the order of 10 ms, which satisfies the requirements of the FDA. The history data (see Figure 6) clearly shows that if the FDA were to allow the use of typical ECG data, like the data used in this study, during clinical trials to assess a drug's affect on the heart, their current criteria would not be practical. Either the interval considered for stability of the heart rate of the healthy young volunteers would need to be widened or the time criteria before and between candidate points would have to be significantly reduced to allow for enough candidate triplets for a valid statistical test. One possible adjustment would be an initial history requirement of 8 seconds and 10 seconds between candidate triplicates.\n\nWe have proposed a smoothed, vertically adjusted, scaled sum of squares statistic for quantifying the similarity among triplicates. Results from analysis with this similarity showed that the measure of similarity performed well when choosing similar beats in several patients. Finally, we showed that the confidence interval calculated shows that there is no evidence of difference across-record for the ECG data. We are in the process of acquiring thorough ECG data from pharmaceutical companies. We hope to apply our methods to this data in the future.\n\nOur aim is to develop an application to explore the behavior of the aggregate losses and revenues generated by a portfolio of insured mortgages. This application will provide information for capital allocation, pricing of, and stress testing of mortgage insurance risk. Our objective is to determine how the dependency among cohorts affects the aggregate losses and with this information, predict future gains and losses to a mortgage insurance company. [2] 2 Background\n\nMortgage loans are underwritten, funded, and insured during a cohort inception period. Depending on the borrows behavior, over time, these loans can be prepayed, become delinquent, or terminate with loss. During good economic conditions a borrower can chose to refinance an existing mortgage loan, which is a loss to the loan company. In other cases a borrower can become delinquent and possibly become a loss to the loan company if they are not able to repay. There are five states for the life of mortgage loans, these states and possible transitions between states can be seen in the flowchart in Figure 1. All loan polices start in the Persistent Never-Deliquent (PSTND) status. Since PSTND is an emitting state, a loan can either stay in PSTND, become a Never-Delinquent Runoff (NDROFF), or become Persistent Ever-Delinquent (PSTED). If a borrower keeps up their payments but decides to refinance, the loan policy is lost to NDROFF. This situation is mostly likely to happen in a good market, when insurance rates are going down and housing price index is increasing. If the borrower becomes delinquent (i.e. misses a payment), the policy becomes PSTED.\n\nOnce a loan becomes PSTED, it can either stay in that state or transition to Ever-Delinquent Runoff (EDROFF), which contains both Ever-Delinquent Non-Claim (EDNC) and Termination with Claim (TC) states. A loan policy can reside in EDNC if a borrower pays off the loan balance with out cost to the loan company. This can happen if the borrower simply pays off the loan in full or sells the house for at least the amount of the loan balance. If a borrower is not able to pay off the loan, the policy is terminated and become a major loss to the loan company (TC).\n\nFrom this flowchart we developed a matrix model corresponding to the dynamical state model for the loan dynamics, given in section 4.2.2.\n\nThe transition between loan states can be analogues to the scenario of migrating population. As the outflow of policies from PSTND increases and if theres no new inflow of polices into PSTND, i.e. the remaining population of PSTND decreases (Figure 2), either the inflow of polices into PSTED (Figure 3) or the inflow of polices into Never-Delinquent runoff (NDROFF) (Figure 4), or both, increases. The comparison of the population of polices in PSTND, PSTED, and NDROFF in the particular year of 1980 are shown in Figure 5. A PSTED status of a loan is invariably attained when a PSTND policy defaults and does not result in a transition to the NDROFF state. We would therefore expect a fairly strong negative relationship between the PSTED and PSTND states. The reason we do not expect the correlation to be extremely high is the possibility of losing policies also to the NDROFF status. This however may not be the case depending on the rates at which policies are lost to the NDROFF and PSTED states.\n\nTypically, the rate at which policies are lost to NDROFF will be larger than the rate at which policies are lost to EDROFF when interest rates are low. We would expect low interest rate and   probably very low HPI to drive the NDROFF status curve more than the PSTED status curve and hence the EDROFF status curve. Practically, individuals whose policies have consistently been in the PSTND state will have a better chance of refinancing than those who are in the PSTED state. Hence, we would expect the NDROFF status curve to rise faster than the EDROFF status curve when prevailing interest rates are low. Low HPI will also drive the NDROFF status curve for the most part. It so happens that conditions just about opposite to those outlined above will potentially drive the NDROFF status curve downward at some point in the future.\n\nThe amount of policies in the PSTED state has a strong negative correlation with the amount of polices in the PSTND state. This is typified by the plots we see above. We hypothesize that high interest rate is one of the factors that can cause policies to be lost from the PSTND status to a PSTED staus. That is, the PSTED status curve may increase with high interest rate and decrease with low interest rate, since policies that are lost from the PSTND status during conditions of low interest rate may go to the NDROFF status. We also expect (in the absence of any data giving us the basis)that high interest rate and/or low HPI will cause many policies from the PSTED status to transition to the TC and the EDNC status. However, we would expect the EDNC status curve to increase with low interest rate since it makes refinancing easier.\n\nA policy in the PSTED status can either stay in its original state or transcend to, the accumulated EDROFF state, which consists of the (EDNC) and TC states, so the policy can be in either one of those two states. Figure 6 shows the absorbing relationship between the PSTED and EDROFF states, in which the EDROFF state becomes a silo for all loans previously in the PSTED state.\n\nThe EDROFF state is directly linked to the PSTED state. Specifically, the two states are negatively correlated. The plots below, (Figure 7 and Figure 8) depicts the number of mortgages in these categories and suggests a practical relationship between these categories that we see in the flowchart 1. We see the EDROFF state curve rise from age 2 through about age 5 8. There is a little bit of rise towards age 6 and a gradual decline which becomes more rapid after age 7. In a business sense, we would expect policies in the PSTED status to turn into EDROFF status, i.e. to prepay loans and refinance when interest rates go down. Hence, the sharp rise from age 2 through age 5. We hypothesize that conditions of low interest rates coupled with low HPI will drive the curve from ages 2 through 5. We suspect that the EDROFF status curve will increase with low interest rate because we expect that the rate of polices entering the EDNC state (mainly, refinancing) may increase when low interest rates are available to borrowers. Also, we expect that the rate of policies transitioning into the TC status may increase when HPI is low. That is, borrowers may not want to pay \"so much\" for a home that has lost \"value\". We still expect some mixture of low interest rates and low HPI to drive the curve from ages 5 through 7. The slight rise from 5 to 6 is probably due to slighly lower interest rates and HPI which will drive the curve a few inches upwards. A similar explanation may not be out of place for age 6 through 7. The decline from age 7 onwards is due to almost directly opposite conditions to those that drive the first half of the curve. In other words, we expect the EDROFF status curve to decrease with conditions of high interest rate and/or HPI.\n\nGiven that EDNC and TC status categories make up EDROFF state, we will expect a positive relationship between the PSTED state and the EDNC state since the latter is positively correlated with the EDROFF state (Figure 9). We expect to observe a positive relationship between the two variables over the long haul as shown in the correlation plots. However, there is a tendency for the correlation to be negative at certain times. This negative relationship is brought about by the magnitude of the rate of flow of policies into the TC state from the PSTED state is and also the rate of flow of policies into the PSTED state (Figure 7). We think that high interest rate, which may be correlated with inflation, will possibly cause borrowers to default at some point and therefore increase the rate of polices into the PSTED state. Therefore, market conditions such as high interest rate will increase the rate of flow of policies into the PSTED state and at the same time, we would have a large rate of flow of policies into the TC state, that is, a large termination rate. If the rate of flow of policies into the TC state is larger than the rate of flow of policies into the PSTED state, we would expect the PSTED state to have a negative marginal increase while    the TC state has a positive marginal increase. This brings about the negative correlation at some point in time.\n\nTerminated policies with a claim is predicted to occur during high interest rate and low HPI economic conditions. Also, the amount of polices in the TC status is expected to be positively correlated with the amount of polices in the PSTED state over the long haul (Figure 7). This relationship, like the one we saw above, can also be a negative relationship at certain times as a result of the rate of flow of policies into the PSTED state, and subsequently, the rate of flow of policies into the TC state. The dynamics of the relationship is as described above. We expect that loans that terminate with claims do so very early, since the longer a policy lasts, the more equity the borrower builds up and the more likely such borrowers are to end up in the EDNC state. Hence, we would possibly expect, from the shape of the curve, that the TC status curve will climb steadily and then begin to decline from the 6th or 7th years onward (Figure 10). We hypothesize that this is due to economic conditions such as low HPI and interest rate.\n\nWe developed a simple linear deterministic model for possible states of the loan. Namely, N, never delinquent, E, ever delinquent, and T, terminated. We assume that never delinquent loans can only remain in N or move to E and that no elements in N can move to T. The rate that Never delinquent loans become ever delinquent is denoted by r and the rate at which ever delinquent loans become terminated loans is s. The matrix relation for the amount of never delinquent, ever delinquent, and terminated loans is as follows,\n\nWe have developed a more precise dynamic model for the states of the loan. The drivers of these rates include: -loan risk grades distribution, which we suppose to be fixed for purposes of the exercise, -housing market dynamics (interest rate and home price diffusions)whose effects are translated into the transitition rates in your model by \"behavioral models\" whose outputs you can assume have been given to you, and -dependencies between these housing market effects and the loan cohorts originated at different times [3] The random variables of interest are the various transition rates at each aging period, as they emerge from the action of housing markets on the holders of loans backed by collateral in those markets. Broadly speaking, when loan rates drop significantly after origination, the rate of borrower prepayments increases (more for never-delinquent than for ever-delinquent, but both are similar in direction), and when loan rates increase, prepayment rates drop off to lower levels, but with a lower bound equal to the homeowner \"move rate\" which varies from geography to geography, but averages around 6% nationwide, and varies generally between the range of 4% and 15%. Likewise, when home price changes are close to or above long term trends in a stable economy, delinquencies and claims tend to decline below long-term average rates, and when home price changes are small or flat, delinquencies and claims tend to rise somewhat above long term averages, and the transition from delinquencies to claims increases rapidly as home price changes decline to zero and increasingly negative percents. For a given loan type, the borrower's remaining equity in the collateral is the most sensitive variable predictive of delinquencies transitioning to claims. The bulk of insured loans have inital borrower equities ranging from 15% to 3%, and a few go down as far as 0%. What happens as the loans age will determine the borrower's equity at a given time. [3]\n\nThe objective is to create an application which uses the deterministic model, with statistically computed certificate flow rates from the data to develop a rudimentary simulation of the given data. The application should accept the parameters, year and division from the user and return the corresponding dynamics matrix for simulation purposes. Deterministic improvements on the model will be made through further intuition and insights from the literature. Probabilistic improvements of the model are expected and will be implemented accordingly.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows; 1) Program accesses geo-temporal dispersion data 2) User specifies division and year as parameters 3) Program computes time step differences for each cohort status under the given parameters 4) Time step differences are labeled as follows,\n\nAssign rates according to the flowchart in figure one, by taking the differences of a particular state and then dividing by its previous state at each time-step.\n\n) Find an average over all rates; r T i , r D i , r S i , r C i . 7) Bulid a matrix,\n\n6 Numerical Analysis\n\nWe would generally expect PSTND and PSTED to be negatively correlated as the plot shows above (Figure 11. However, there is the tendency also to observe a positive relationship sometime. This transient change in relationship is brought about by the rates at which policies from PSTND are being lost to PSTED and NDROFF, as well as the rate at which policies are lost from PSTED to EDROFF. When the rate at which policies are lost from PSTND to NDROFF is larger than the rate at which policies are lost to PSTED, and also the loss of policies from PSTED to EDROFF is large, we would expect the marginal increase in PSTED to be negative. Therefore, PSTND and PSTED will decrease together and this will bring about a positive relationship between PSTND and PSTED. We will not expect this trend to continue for too long as we see in the plot. Low interest rate can cause the situation described above to occur. High HPI could also potentially elicit a similar relationship. Unlike PSTND, we expect also a positive correlation, generally, between PSTED and EDNC (Figure 12). Given that EDROFF at any aging year is the sum of EDNC and TC, and a positive correlation exists between PSTED and EDROFF, we would by any means expect PSTED and EDNC also to be positively correlated, all things being equal. We see much of this relationship in the plot above. However, like most of the relationships, the rate of policies leaving PSTED for EDROFF, affect this relationship. In a situation where the rate of loss of policies to EDNC is very high as compared to the rate at which policies are being lost to PSTED, a negative marginal increase is observed in PSTED. We would expect this relationship to be negative. High HPI and low interest rate foster this situation. See Figure 12. Also, the relationship we see between PSTED and TC is as we expect, See Figure 12. Conditions of high interest rate and low HPI are plausible for the behavior of the relationship. We would expect policies in the PSTED status to terminate with claims very early in their lifetime. This is consistent with the behavior of the TC curve which rises very fast for the first few years as PSTED decreases but after a while begins to fall. This is as a result of policies lost from PSTED going to EDNC since such borrowers may have built up enough equity among other reasons low interest rate, high HPI. [4] We want to note that EDROFF is the sum of TC and EDNC. Therefore, we would also expect a positive relationship between PSTED and EDROFF, and also a positive relationship, generally, between EDROFF and EDNC and TC a in Figure 13. Since each year corresponds to a different pair of interest rate (IR) and house price index (HPI), we may consider those financial variables as some functions of IR and HPI, and then see how they are related to each other. There are many ways to investigate the dependencies. A commonly used scheme would be to conjecture some algebraic form for the function at first, and then use the real data to fit in to get the estimate of the arguments. However, sometimes there may never be a algebraic form for the function. Even if it exists, the form could be very complicated, and require expensive cost to find it. In those cases, another very useful scheme, called numerical interpolation, can come up as an alternative. In this section, we briefly introduce this important technique.\n\nWe will explain it through a simple example. Suppose we wan to find how IR and HPI affect the correlation between EDNC and CLAIM. A set of sample data points are provided, and we want to use interpolation to estimate the correlation at some given pairs of IR and HPI.\n\nIn order to utilize interpolation techniques efficiently, two important assumptions are made here. First, we assume the function is continuous and depends on these variables smoothly to some extent. This is a reasonable hypothesis, for example, we can look at the plot of correlation versus HPI (Figure 14), which indeed demonstrates some trend of continuity. Second, we assume a data point is mostly affected by nearby points, and for those faraway points, the influence is relatively small. This is also a logical hypothesis in the financial world, because what happens this year should mainly related to what has happened in recent years.\n\nWith the two assumptions in mind, one can interpolate those data points of interest based on the actual data points given. Depending on the accuracy requirement and the algorithm complexity, four different interpolating schemes are provided: linear, nearest, cubic and v4, varying from the relatively simple to complicated. The first one uses piecewise linear function to fit the data. The second one, as its name indicates, takes the nearest data point as the prediction. The cubic scheme utilizes polynomials of degree 3 to do the interpolation based on up to 16 data points nearby. The last one uses an even more complicated algorithm. The 'cubic' and 'v4' methods produce smooth surfaces, while 'linear' and 'nearest' have discontinuities in the first and zero'th derivatives, respectively. All the methods except 'v4' are based on a Delaunay triangulation of the data. For more details, one can check [1] [5] [6].\n\nHere is some plots about the interpolation results (Figure 15). Those small circles are actual data points used for interpolation. We do estimation on every mesh grid point. As one can see, the last one, 'v4', give the smoothest surfaces, which is consistent with our initial assumption of a continuous and smooth function. Intuitively, we can think that a smoother interpolation gives a more accurate result, because it use more information for the estimation. Let us give it a bit more investigation.\n\nThere is a more detailed view about v4 interpolation (Fig 16). One can see how the correlation changes over the IR and HPI. One observation would be that the correlation varies rapidly along 5 10 15 20 100 150 200 250 0.9 0.95 1 1.05 1.1 interest rate linear house price index correlation 5 10 15 20 100 150 200 250 0.9 0.95 1 1.05 1.1 interest rate nearest house price index correlation 5 10 15 20 100 150 200 250 0.9 0.95 1 1.05 1.1 interest rate cubic house price index correlation 5 10 15 20 100 150 200 250 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 interest rate v4 house price index correlation  The contour plot provides intuitive results from another interesting aspect(Figure 17). Each curve represents a path along which the same correlation is achieved. They reveal more about the changing pattern of the correlation over these two factors. And we can easily predict the correlation on a data 0 .9 4 0 .9 4 0 .9 6 0 .9 6 0. 96 0. 98 0 .9 8 0 .9 8 0 .9 8 point. For example, when IR is 12.25 and HPI is 120.5, the estimated correlation between EDNC and CLAIM would be 0.9807. In the appendix we provide a function (corrmtx1fn.m), which takes IR and HPI as inputs, and will output a correlation matrix about all the 6 different cohorts (Edroff, Ednc, Claim, Ndroff, PSTED, PSTND). Moreover, this method can be extended to apply on any MI financial variables, such as cohort, cash flow, as long as they satisfy those two assumptions.\n\nHere we use numerical interpolation of two-dimension and only investigate the dependencies of correlation on IR and HPI. If we want to investigate how it is affected by other variables, such as the age factor, we can incorporate the new variables and do higher dimensional interpolation. Also, one may notice some absurd prediction from the above, like a correlation number lager than 1. This is some pitfall of the numerical interpolation, as it does not take the physical meaning of the variables into account. We can add some restriction and improve the method such that it gives more logical estimate. All these will be left for future work.\n\nThis paper is intended to be a preliminary investigation into the dependency structure between cohorts. In summary, we first find the correlations among the cohorts. Using that information and the general knowledge of the data, we set up the dynamic model to develop dependency of future cohorts based on the past information, and find how HPI and IR can affect the cohorts. All above are just some very basic analyses of aggregate loss model. Future research would include:\n\n(1.) Improving the HPI and IR components in the attached program so that these values can be included as inputs.\n\n(2.) Including age and division effects in the program. (3.) Assuming that age, origination year, and cohort effect are additive and there is no interaction among them, we can include a constrained multiple regression in the cohort analysis:\n\nwhere the effect of ith age group is given by a i , the effect of jth year by p j , and the effect of kth cohort by c k . µ is the grand mean of the dependent variable and e ij is the random error. Y ijk is the dependent variable which is the number of claim policies with respect to each age group and year in each cohort.\n\nUsing that model we can estimate the effect of age, year and cohort and predict the future number of claim policies for given age and year in a specific cohort. (4.) Investigate, through a three-dimensional interpolation to explore the effect of the age factor on the dependencies of correlation of the IR and HPI financial variables.\n\n(5.) Integrate statistical time series analysis with copula theory to provide a unified model of timedependence. This is a relatively new field, and after more theoretical work is published, this field can be expected to become a major element in the world of financial economics.\n\nif myir<min(x) | myir>max(x) | myhpi<min(y) | myhpi>max(y) disp('Warning: The estimated point is out of bound.

If κ(A) is not too large, the matrix is said to be well-conditioned. Matrices with large condition numbers are said to be ill-conditioned, which means A is close to singular. We may not be able to trust the computation results of an ill-conditioned matrix.\n\nFrom Theorem 2.1 and equation ( 4) it is clear that when solving the system Ax = b using LU -factorization, it is necessary to make sure that the product κ(L)κ(U ) is close to κ(A). This will ensure that LU -factorization is numerically stable.\n\n3 Graph Theory Terminology\n\nThe following graph theory terms and concepts are used to derive our permutation matrix.\n\nA graph G = (V, E) is a collection of vertices, V , and edges, E, such that each edge is associated with exactly two vertices, called its endpoints. We say that an edge e ∈ E and a vertex v ∈ V are incident if v is one of the endpoints of e. When e ∈ E is incident with x, y ∈ V we write e = (x, y) and when each edge e ∈ E is assigned a value w ∈ R we refer to them as weighted edges and we denote them by e = (x, y, w). We say two vertices are adjacent if they are joined by an edge and two edges are adjacent if they share an endpoint.\n\nA graph G = (V, E) is bipartite if V can be partitioned into two sets X and Y such that for every e ∈ E we have e = (x, y) for some x ∈ X and y ∈ Y . In this case, the bipartite graph is denoted G = (X ∪ Y, E). A path P is a sequence of adjacent edges in which successive edges are incident to the same vertex. A path is cyclic if the first and last edges share a common vertex.\n\nA matching for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset M ⊆ E such that each v ∈ V is incident with at most one edge e ∈ M . We denote the cardinality of a matching by |M |, which gives the number of edges in M . A matching M is maximum if for each matching M ⊂ E we have |M | ≥ |M |. A matching M is perfect if for each v ∈ V there exists e ∈ M such that v is incident with e.\n\nIn general, a graph may not have a perfect matching. For instance, it is clear from the definition that a perfect matching requires an even number of vertices. Hence, any graph with an odd number of vertices cannot have a perfect matching. The graphs we will construct will be guaranteed to have a perfect matching, and in most cases these graphs will have several distinct perfect matchings.\n\nTo obtain a maximum matching, we find successive matchings of increasing cardinality using specifically chosen paths. Note that if the graph is guaranteed to have a perfect matching then any maximum matching will be a perfect matching. Given a matching M , we say that P is an M -alternating path if the edges of P alternate between being in M and not in M . An M -alternating path is called an M -augmenting path if it connects two unmatched vertices.\n\nFor M, P ⊆ E, then we define We provide the following results about augmenting paths without proof (the proofs can be found in [4], Chapter 10). Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 provide a natural algorithm to find a maximum matching as follows: while G has an M -augmenting path P , find M ⊕ P . Figures 1234illustrate an example where a maximum matching is found using augmenting paths. Figure 3: M ⊕ P toggles the matching along P Figure 4: Resultant maximum matching 4 The Unweighted Matching Algorithm (MC21) Given an n × n matrix A, there is a natural edge-weighted bipartite graph G A = (V R ∪V C , E) with |V R | = |V C | = n that can be extracted from the matrix. Let V R = {r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n } and V C = {c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n } be such that r i corresponds to row i in A and c j corresponds to column j in A. Now, for each nonzero entry a ij in A, define the weighted edge e = (r i , c j , a ij ). It is known that if A is a nonsingular matrix, then there exists a perfect matching for G A . Note that each edge e ∈ M corresponds to a nonzero entry in A and further if e = (r i , c j ) then neither r i nor c j can be incident to any other edge in M . Hence, no two entries from A that correspond to two edges in a matching for G A may be in the same row or column, since otherwise it would not be a matching. Further, if we have a perfect matching for G A , then at least one such entry must exist in each row and column, since otherwise the matching would violate the definition of perfect. We conclude that the edges of a perfect matching of G A correspond to n entries from A so that each row and column contains exactly one such entry. Now there exists a natural permutation matrix P = (p ij ) derived from this matching by defining p ji = 1, if e = (r i , c j ) ∈ M ; 0, otherwise.\n\nSuch a permutation will move some nonzero elements of A to the diagonal, i.e., the diagonal elements of P A will all be nonzero.\n\nWe began with the task of understanding and implementing the algorithm based on unweighted matchings. Although this algorithm does not permute \"large\" entries to the diagonal, it does remove all zeros from the diagonal. After testing this algorithm MC21 found in [2] with many matrices, we then implemented the weighted algorithm and finally developed our own modified algorithm.\n\nThe input for MC21 is a nonsingular n × n matrix A and the output is an n × n permutation vector, P , so that both P A and AP have all nonzero diagonal entries. As mentioned earlier, A must be nonsingular to ensure that a perfect matching can be found with the algorithm. The singularity of the matrix is tested by observing the condition number rather than the determinant, because of the floating point arithmetic used in MATLAB.\n\nThe program uses a vector M to represent the current matching. The indices of M correspond to the columns of A. The j th element of M , M (j), represents the row vertex to which column vertex c j is matched. If column j is not matched, then M (j) = 0. For example, if M = [0 4 0 2] then column 1 is not matched, column 2 is matched to row 4, column 3 is not matched, column 4 is matched to row 2. The current alternating path is represented by the vector P . The program maintains the alternating tree grown with the algorithm using the vector B. Once an augmenting path is found using P and B we update the matching. If the new matching is not perfect, then the program begins to look for the next augmenting path.\n\nAfter coding the algorithm MC21 in MATLAB, we applied it to different classes of matrices from the MATLAB gallery and some large matrices available at [1]. The algorithm worked properly with inputs ranging from 800 × 800 to 3500 × 3500, and with as many nonzeros as nearly 300,000. We then compared our results to the factorizations produced by the built-in LU -factorization function of MATLAB.\n\nUsing MC21, we found the permutation matrix P . Next, we calculated the LU -factorization of P A without pivoting and calculated the condition number of the resulting lower and the upper triangular matrix using the 1-norm. We compared them to the condition number of the lower and upper triangular matrix produced by the LU -factorization of A with pivoting using MATLAB. We also compared the condition number of the lower and the upper triangular matrix to κ(A). By equation (3) we know that\n\nas seen in Figures 10 and 11. The results are summarized in Appendix A, and they were not surprising because we only considered the unweighted matchings of the associated bipartite graph. Nevertheless, we made some interesting observations for a few classes of matrices. For example, MC21 performed better than MATLAB for Leslie matrices and smoke matrices.\n\nA Leslie matrix is the n × n matrix from the Leslie population model with average birth numbers and survival rates. For an 800 × 800 Leslie matrix, we observed that the condition number of the lower triangular matrix obtained using MC21 was 400 times less than condition number of the lower triangular matrix obtained by the built-in MATLAB LU -factorization.\n\nThe ratio of the upper triangular matrix obtained by MC21 to the one obtained by built-in MATLAB LU -factorization was even smaller. The other ratios we considered are also less than or equal to one, suggesting a better performance by MC21 on Leslie matrices. Figure 5 implies the same information and the ratios seem to be converging as the dimension of the matrix increases. One of the interesting facts we observed about these classes of matrices is that the static pivoting (permuting) prevents fill-in that could happen in a sparse matrix when dynamic pivoting is performed. For example, consider the following 4 × 4 matrix from the Matlab Leslie gallery. Let L M be the lower triangular matrix and U M be the upper triangular matrix obtained by built-in LU -factorization of A. These are given in Figure 6. We now permute A using MC21 and perform LU -factorization without pivoting to find the lower triangular matrix L MC21 and the upper triangular matrix U MC21 . The results are shown in Figure 7. P A =     1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1     L MC21     1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1     U MC21 =     1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1     Figure 7: L MC21 and U MC21 for Leslie matrix A When comparing the upper triangular matrices from the one produced using MATLAB builtin LU -factorization to the one produced by MC21, the MATLAB matrix has more non-zero entries.\n\nWe also compared the ratios we discussed earlier on different types of matrices by varying their dimensions. The graphs in Appendix A are a sample we obtained by plotting the ratios for different dimensions.\n\nWe also compared other parameters of the matrices obtained by permuting A using MC21 and the MATLAB built-in LU -factorization. Some of these parameters include\n\n• Norm of the diagonal elements\n\n• Largest diagonal element in magnitude\n\n• Smallest diagonal element in magnitude After testing more than 50 different types of matrices, no observable trend was seen in the results. However, while analyzing the results produced for these classes of matrices we were able to develop some heuristics to later add to the MC21 algorithm to improve its performance.\n\nRecall that since A is nonsingular we know that a perfect matching for G A exists and we described how to build such a perfect matching using augmenting paths. Assuming that there are several distinct perfect matchings for G A , the particular perfect matching that we obtain using augmenting paths depends on which augmenting paths we choose. Since the goal of the problem is to move the entries of \"large\" magnitude in A to the diagonal of P A, we would like the edges of our perfect matching for G A to correspond to entries of \"large\" magnitude in A. In other words, we would like to maximize the edge weights of the edges in the matching for G A . The unweighted matching algorithm that we discussed earlier permutes nonzero entries of A to the diagonal. The main deficiency of this algorithm is that it doesn't necessarily permute \"large\" entries of A to the diagonal because it disregards the weights of the edges. The weighted matching algorithm handles this deficiency under two scenarios:\n\n• We wish to maximize the product of the absolute values of the diagonal entries of P A.\n\n• We wish to maximize the sum of the absolute values of the diagonal entries of P A.\n\nIn both cases, the algorithm is basically the same and so we will only address scenario 1.\n\nFirst, the maximization problem is converted to a minimization problem by defining the cost matrix C = (c ij ) as\n\nwhere a j is the element of largest magnitude in column j of matrix A, i.e., a j = max i |a ij |. Now, finding a permutation P that corresponds to a perfect matching for G A that maximizes the product of the absolute values of the diagonal entries of P A is equivalent to finding a permutation P that corresponds to a perfect matching for G C that minimizes that same product. So, the problem has been reduced to finding a minimum weight perfect matching for G C and the details of this correlation are expressed mathematically in [2]. In order to find the previously mentioned permutation P , algorithm SAP uses the same tactics as MC21, but SAP extends its alternating tree with the extra requirement that its new edges maintain a minimal edge weight. This strategy ensures that the M -augmenting path P chosen at each iteration of the algorithm will form a matching M ⊕ P of minimum weight for its cardinality.\n\nObviously, the algorithm terminates with a perfect matching of minimum edge weight.\n\nWhile the code may seem dense and cumbersome, the concept of the algorithm is pretty straightforward. The main loop maintains two \"lengths\" or \"costs\":\n\n• The length l 1 of the shortest M -alternating path beginning at the root (column) vertex.\n\n• The length l 2 of the shortest M -augmenting path beginning at the root (column) vertex.\n\nTo find a permutation P for a sparse nonsingular n × n matrix A we solved the matching problem with a bipartite weighted graph. During our workshop we implemented a matching algorithm for both the unweighted and weighted case and then developed our own algorithm by modifying the unweighted algorithm. Our algorithm improved the product of the diagonal of the entries compared to the unweighted algorithm and is faster than the weighted algorithm.\n\nFuture research can include investigating different approaches to solve the same problem.\n\nOne such example is to use an algorithm for a transportation task, since the matching problem for a bipartite graph can be interpreted as a transportation problem: we have n towns (r i ∈ V R ) of production corresponding to the matrix columns and n towns (c j ∈ V C ) of consumption of some product corresponding to the rows of the matrix. We also have the matrix A = {a ij }, where a ij is the cost of transportation from town i to town j for each item of the product. We know that each c j can be connected (matched) with only one r i . The question is how to make connections while minimizing the total cost of transportation. Therefore, we have the problem:\n\nx ij = 1, i = 1, . . . , n j\n\nx ij = 1, j = 1, . . . , n\n\nx ij ≥ 0\n\nx = (x ij )-transportation plan, where x ij is the number of items of the product. The solution x should be so that x ij = 1 corresponds to the matching [r i , c j ], while x ij = 0 means that [r i , c j ] is not matched. A solution x to the above system will contain only zeros and ones and hence x will provide a perfect matching. There are algorithms to solve this linear system in [2] Chapter 11.2 and also in lectures [3].\n\nThe bipartite matching problem can also be solved using maximal flow. For this approach, we should add two more points to our bipartite graph: a source and a sink. The edges from the maximal flow correspond to the edges from the matching we seek. To find the path with minimal weight we use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm. Figure 14: Ratios for different sizes of Circulant matrices"
