    "abstract": "Construction defects are always the key concern of the construction industry.\nDifferent constructed facilities generate different types of defects and demanded different levels and types of quality, depending on the functions, system types, and materials used. Nevertheless, construction projects was typically take place in an environment where it is difficult to gain access to conventional computers for use as real-time decision aids as gone through the project quality inspection. The objectives of this study was to identify the inspection process and standard check list used in practice at construction site; to identify the potential and requirement for mobile inspection system at construction site and to develop a prototype of a mobile inspection system for construction site. Data was gathered from the literature study and also through local construction organizations by means of interview questionnaire. A prototype was developed using rapid prototyping method in a final phase. The finding revealed that generally construction industry does not have its standard inspection process and standard check list in practice. Besides this, the study also reveals that there was a potential and requirement for mobile inspection system at construction site. Finally a mobile defect inspection which consists of a sub system checklist and reference system was developed to suit the need of industry. The developed prototype will standardize the way of managing building defects and improve quality, increased productivity of inspectors, accurate photographic records and improved building defect communication. vi ABSTRAK Kecacatan pembinaan pada amnya merupakan isu yang sering dititikberatkan dalam industri pembinaan. Kemudahan fasiliti pembinaan yang berlainan akan menghasilkan kecacatan dan kualiti pembinaan yang berbeza, dan ini adalah bergantung kepada fungsi dan jenis bahan binaan yang digunakan. Pada amnya, projek pembinaan adalah dijalankan dalam keadaaan yang sempit dan menyukarkan seseorang itu bekerja dengan menggunakan komputer biasa di mana ia akan membantu meringankan beban seseorang itu dalam melakukan pemeriksaan kualiti bangunan. Maka objektif kajian adalah untuk menentukan keperluan senarai semakan kualiti yang standard dalam tapak pembinaan; menentukan tahap keperluan terhadap sistem semakan kualiti bangunan mudah alih dalam tapak pembinaan dan membangunkan suatu aplikasi sistem semakan kualiti mudah alih bagi kegunaan dalam tapak pembinaan. Data terhadap keperluan aplikasi sistem semakan kualiti bangunan mudah alih tersebut diperolehi melalui kaedah soal selidik dan juga kajian literatur terhadap industri pembinaan tempatan. Satu model aplikasi telah dibangunkan dengan cara rapid prototyping pada fasa akhir kajian ini. Hasil daripada kajian ini menunjukkan bahawa industri pembinaan tempatan pada hari ini masih tidak mempunyai suatu senarai semakan dan proses semakan yang standard. Selain daripada itu, keputusan kajian juga menunjukkan bahawa terdapatnya ruang dan potensi yang besar dalam industri pembinaan tempatan untuk penggunaan semakan kualiti bangunan secara mudah alih. Satu model sistem semakan kecacatan mudah alih yang mengandungi sub-sistem senarai semakan dan rujukan telah dibangunkan bagi memenuhi kehendak industri. Model tersebut dapat mendatangkan pelbagai kebaikan dalam pengurusan kecacatan bangunan, peningkatan kualiti dan produktiviti juru semakan, rekod gambaran yang tepat dan meningkatkan komunikasi kecacatan bangunan. vii",

It would seem that the construction industry would be a wide area for the application of handheld computers due to their special features in the light weight, small in pocket size for easier in traveling and mobilization and had own a processing feature and software as much as the desktop personal computers.\n\nHowever the all most nature of construction projects and the cost of setting up various decision support systems often act as a barrier to implementing the systems. But, the time had change, handheld computers now days are becoming more powerful and less costly and even some of the handheld computers are now embedded in to the cell phone today to improve in organizing the phone and address book and also the daily schedule and this had make the potential to employ these devices widely in construction are become greater and wider.\n\nThe information needs at the construction site are varied. Personnel in the field require information to make decisions about the construction processes being conducted and update it updated periodically. They also collect data concerning project progress, quality, and costs. Handheld computing applications will therefore include textual information and graphical information about construction as well as form-based software to collect data.\n\nReference information is one of the basic uses for which handheld computers can be employed. The specific information included on the handheld device will vary from project-to-project and organization-to-organization. It would be assumed that contractors would place more of an emphasis on installation procedures, and owner organizations would emphasize documentation for inspection procedures and quality control. Typical documentation that can be accommodated on a handheld computer is such as real time progress monitoring of on-site works, remote expert support, onsite collection of qualitative and quantitative measurements, collaborative review of technical drawings, on-site supplier and subcontractor evaluation, on-site evaluation of equipment usage measurements, keeping track of the physical equipment position anytime and anywhere, answering audit checklists and filing audit reports during site audits (Meissner et al., 2001). Therefore, the application of information technology in this field will give more advantages.\n\nIT can be define as the use of electronic machines and programs for the processing, data storage, transfer and presentation of information (Bjork, 1997).\n\nWith emerge of the 3G technology today, it had become the best methods to deliver reference content to the handheld devices. One method will be to download entire documents to the handheld computer by physical connection to a desktop computer.\n\nBut the emerging 3G method is to wirelessly access Web pages on the Internet and display the information on a handheld computer. The advantage of this Web access is that documents can be updated easily and the new content can be made available to all users immediately.\n\nTraditionally, the construction industry has employed paper-based data capture and communication methods. These were time-consuming and potentially error-prone, and discouraged project managers from using them on a regular basis.\n\nThus people tend to minimize communication with other project participants. Since the various stages and tasks of construction are highly interdependent this minimal interaction in practice causes severe problems, widely reflecting on other partners and the final construction product (Ladh, 1995). It has been recognized for some time that capturing data through handheld computing devices, enabled with suitable wireless capability, can address these problems, thereby increasing operative efficiency and ensuring better integration with the existing project management systems.\n\nA number of construction projects are based on online project collaboration solutions and a new community of virtual construction team members has emerged.\n\nThis team has two main categories of people who would benefit from the adoption of mobile computing technologies. The first category comprises of workers such as contractor's team executing the project. Such workers require an interface to backend system to maintain contact with their office based counterparts. The other category comprises professionals who spend a significant amount of time in the office but quite often have to travel to the different construction sites. Such professionals will need an interface to the information held in their offices both while in transit and while on the site.\n\nThe rapid growth of handheld computing devices in recent years has marked the beginning of a real mobile communication capability. From their roots as standalone devices that were reliant upon a cable connection to a desktop PC or a connected mobile phone, handhelds are now evolving to integrate features that enable wireless connection to mobile phone and corporate networks. However to a large extent, current use of mobile communication devices for the construction industry remains limited to use of standalone hand held device (C. J Anumba, 2003).\n\nNevertheless the used of PDA and telecommunications are long exits in Construction industry and there are few research been carries out on concept of using obsolesce technology such as concept of using Psion as mobile web browser to browse through the internet at any ware in the paper of \"PDA as mobile WWW browsers\" (Stefab Gessler, 1995), and also using handheld computer to browse through an electronic document such as e-book in the construction industry and also using a third party software for data collection in the paper of \"Applying Handheld computers in the construction industry\" (Trefor P.willians, 2003).\n\nLater, the player in the construction industry had aware of the need of more capable mobile computing system in the construction industry due to the booming of information technology, then they had put their mind into and develop a concept of interaction between mobile computing system and construction in the paper \"Mobile Communication In Construction-Trends And Prospects\" (C. J. Anumba, 2003). In the paper of \"The application of PDA as mobile computing system on construction management\" (Kenji Kimoto, 2005) had draft out a stand along construction management prototype where the information collection from construction site is not transmit instantaneous and only can be retrieve and analysis when the mobile device is send back to office, further more the interface use in this prototype is a set of static programs which more to structure engineering analysis. Therefore it can not perform dynamic interaction to collect data due to the dynamic nature of construction environment.\n\nSince the office automation at the late 1980s has improved the productivity of office works rapidly until today. Site officer, project engineers and construction managers in Malaysia today have recently handled various types of digital information such as drawings, specification, checklists and daily reports.\n\nHowever, they still need to access the real construction site to check and manage the construction project. They usually use sheets of paper and/or field notes.\n\nAs a result, they still have a lot of typical and routine jobs in construction site, such as the collection of construction data and the inspection. A gap in time and space between the outdoor construction site and the office, which leads to the low efficiency, occurs and cause into several issues and problem that have been discussed by the public and government recently. From the issues of computer labs and 16\n\n\"sick\" schools and five community colleges with structural defects, to the closing of Sultan Ismail Hospital in Johor Bahru because of a fungal outbreak due to faulty air-conditioning and the latest issues where the key Middle Ring Road in Kuala Lumpur had to be closed after cracks were found.\n\n1. To review the inspection process and standard check list used in practice at construction site.\n\n2. To identify the potential at and requirement for mobile inspection system at construction site.\n\n3. To develop a prototype at a mobile inspection system for construction site.\n\nThe scope of this study will focus on the activity of defect inspection at the final phase construction before handover. Area of this study will only carry out in area of PERAK and JOHOR.\n\nThe following methodology has been adopted in achieve the objective list previously: -1. In order to achieve the first objective which is identify the problems face in construction site and the method of inspection during concreting structure frame, the method for acquisition data will be interviewing construction site personal.\n\n2. However to achieve the second objective which is to identify the potential at and requirement for mobile inspection system at construction site, the method to acquire data is by conducting a literature research on previous thesis which had been carried out before.\n\n3. To achieve final objective which is to develop a prototype at a mobile inspection system for construction site, rapid prototyping method has been chosen to develop the mobile system. 1.8 Report Organization a.

Different constructed facilities generate different types of defects and demand different levels and types of quality, depending on the functions, system types, and materials used. Most defect research concentrates on materials and systems, examining different types of defects under given conditions and determining methods for how to detect them. As a result, these researches are generally focused on technical and technological issues. Numerous systems have been designed to eliminate defects during construction operations. Many of these systems were very effective in detecting and eliminating defects that occurred at the construction stage,\n\nbut a large number of complaints about defects were also recorded a few years after the occupants moved in, which suggested that there were still loopholes in the existing inspection and management systems (Wai-Kiong Chong, 2005).\n\nTherefore, for the construction projects typically take place in an environment where it is difficult for project engineers and inspectors in the field to gain access to conventional computers for use as real-time decision aids, it is often inconvenient to carry bulky plans and reference documents into the field. It would seem that the construction industry would be a fertile area for the application of handheld computers. However the one-time nature of most construction projects and the cost of setting up various decision support systems often act as a barrier to implementing the systems.\n\nHandheld computers are becoming more powerful and less costly. The potential exists to employ these devices widely in construction. However, it is necessary to examine their capabilities and to consider how they can best be employed. At a basic level, a handheld computer can be used as a personal digital assistant that allows users to access and organize information such as addresses and phone numbers. On a more sophisticated level, handheld computers can be used to run programs for a wide variety of applications, and provide e-mail and Internet access (Helpful, 2001).\n\nThe information needs at the construction site are varied. Personnel in the field require information to make decisions about the construction processes being conducted. They also collect data concerning project progress, quality, and costs.\n\nHandheld computing applications will therefore include textual information and graphical information about construction as well as form-based software to collect data.\n\nReference information is one of the basic uses for which handheld computers can be employed. The specific information included on the handheld device will vary from project-to-project and organization-to-organization. It would be assumed that contractors would place more of an emphasis on installation procedures, and owner organizations would emphasize documentation for inspection procedures and quality control. Typical documentation that can be accommodated on a handheld computer is standard specifications, quality standards, construction techniques, inspection checklists, and any type of training or educational material. An exciting feature of handheld computers is their ability to display full-motion videos with sound. This suggests the potential to present videos of correct construction techniques to workers at the construction site.\n\nWith the continuing technological advances in wireless connectivity, additional questions will emerge over the next several years concerning the best methods to deliver reference content to the handheld devices. One method will be to download entire documents to the handheld computer by physical connection to a desktop computer. But now the emerging method is to wirelessly access Web pages on the Internet and display the information on a handheld computer. The advantage of this Web access is that documents can be updated easily and the new content can be made available to all users immediately.\n\nMuch of the information used on the construction site is of a type that can be applied on many different projects. This would include items like standard specifications, educational materials about standard construction methods, and material standards. Project-specific information includes the project plans and the project-specific specifications. Obviously, these documents are the most important to include and the ability to provide them in an electronic format could have the greatest impact on a project.\n\nHowever, the nature of the construction industry requires that these documents be set up in an electronic format specifically for each individual project.\n\nAdditionally, these electronic plans will only be used for the duration of construction, which proves to be for a short period compared to the service life of the structure or facility. A utility company can justify the expense of developing a system to display plans on a handheld device because it will be used for a long period of time to maintain its infrastructure.\n\nDue to the short-term nature of many construction projects, the cost precludes implementation of sophisticated, project-specific applications. Only complex longlived projects can justify having a specific decision-support system developed. The project-specific applications require the most significant investment because more sophisticated equipment and software is required to display complex plans and engineering documentation on handheld computers.\n\nThe most widely used handheld computers operate either on the Palm or the Windows-based Pocket PC operating systems. Palm computers are the leader in the handheld computer market. In addition, the popular Handspring Visor also uses the Palm operating system. The Palm operating system is easy to use and there is a large quantity of general-purpose add-on software and hardware to increase the devices functionality (Pogue, 1999), but there is not a large quantity of specific construction software or applications are available in the market now.\n\nNevertheless Pocket PC devices tend to be more expensive than Palm devices because they offer software and hardware more in-line with full-featured computers.\n\nBut in particular, Pocket PC devices run a compact version of the Windows operating system (Morrison, 2001). Table 2.1 shows a comparison of the Palm and Pocket PC devices. Pocket PC devices are selected over Palm devices for high-end applications that require high screen resolution and color. In now days, two for use with Pocket PC devices are support by many very powerful software applications are available in the market that can be used to develop project-specific applications for viewing plans and maps.\n\nVarious technologies will emerge over the next several years that will change how handheld devices are used. In particular, various methods for wireless communication such as WLAN, 3G and Bluetooth are emerging.\n\nWith emerging of these wireless communications technology that will allow for easier communications between mobile devices, once a handheld computer is equipped with the these wireless communications hardware, it can communicate wirelessly with other wireless communications equipped devices within 10 m including other handheld computers, mobile phones, desktop PCs, and printers. It can be used to form local wireless networks or to allow devices to communicate directly.\n\nIt can potentially provide a wireless means of transferring data from a handheld device to a desktop PC in a project field office. The implication for the construction site will be that information can be transferred between users at the construction site more easily as these various types of data networks emerge (Figure 2.1) (McDonough, 2001). 2.5.1 Introduction to Wireless Communication The 1G period began in the late 1970s and lasted through the 1980s. These systems featured the first true mobile phone systems, known at first as \"cellular mobile radio telephone.\" These networks used analog voice signaling, and were little more sophisticated than repeater networks used by amateur radio operators. The 2G phase began in the 1990s, and much of this technology is still in use. The 2G cell phone features digital voice encoding. Examples include CDMA, TDMA, and GSM. Since its inception, 2G technologies have steadily improved, with increased  While 3G is generally considered applicable mainly to mobile wireless, it is also relevant to fixed wireless and portable wireless. The ultimate 3G system might be operational from any location on, or over, the earth's surface, including use in homes, businesses, government offices, medical establishments, the military, personal and commercial land vehicles, private and commercial watercraft and marine craft, private and commercial aircraft (except where passenger use restrictions apply), portable (pedestrians, hikers, cyclists, campers), and space stations and spacecraft.\n\nProponents of 3G technology promise that it will \"keep people connected at all times and in all places.\" Researchers, engineers, and marketers are faced with the challenge of accurately predicting how much technology consumers will actually be willing to pay for. (Recent trends suggest that people sometimes prefer to be disconnected, especially when on vacation.) Another concern involves privacy and security issues.\n\nThe first prototype of hand held organizer was developing by the Psion in the mid-1980s and later in spring of 1984, Psion had launched its first organizer in the world which is Psion 1. The Psion 1 was slightly longer and thicker than a large pack of cigarettes and was built using the 8-bit technology. Besides that, Psion 1 is using the 10 K character storage to store its data and it's also performed basic organizer functions such as recording a phone book, address and daily schedule. The Psion is using only 16-character mono chrome LCD display.\n\nThe launch of the Psion 1 was very successful and later in year 1986, the Psion II was been develop and launch. This Psion II is more powerful than the Psion 1 and it had 64 K ROM and 32 K RAM memory for a bigger data storage and also a wide 4 x 20 character display for a wider display purpose and then later the Series 3a Psion which is representing a new generation of PDAs. The Psion Series 3a was created based on 16-bit technology and with LCD which consist of 40 characters x 8 line. The Psion Series 3a at that time also consist of 58-key keyboard and this PDA was the first built to link to desktop PC for data transfers. However the Psion Series 5 had been created with followed up the success of the 3a which is base on 32-bit technology on its mobile processor. The display screen of the Psion Series 5 had been enlarge to screen (640 x 240 pixels) and also enlarged keyboard to date In 1993 Apple Computer Inc. tried to copy Psion's success, Apple Computer Inc. had introduced the world to the first PDA, the Newton®. They were dubbed PDAs (personal digital assistants) by John Sculley, former chairman of Apple Computer Inc, and were sold as the ultimate information appliance. Sculley predicted PDAs would become ubiquitous tools that would hold telephone numbers, keep your calendar, store notes, plus send and receive data wirelessly. Although, the Newton was not able to deliver all of those features at the time it was released. Pocket PCs running previous versions of the operating system generally stored user-installed applications and data in RAM, which meant that if the battery was depleted the device would lose all of its data. Windows Mobile 5 solves this problem by storing all user data in the ROM, leaving the RAM to be used only for running applications, as it would be on a desktop computer. As a result, Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PCs generally have a greater amount of flash ROM, and a smaller amount of RAM, compared to earlier devices.\n\nA Pocket PC is a handheld-sized computer that runs a specific version of the Windows CE operating system. It has many capabilities of modern desktop PCs.\n\nCurrently there are thousands of applications for Pocket PC, many of which are Freeware. Some of these devices, running Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 Phone Edition, also include mobile phone features. Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons like GPS receivers, barcode readers, and cameras. According to Microsoft, the Pocket PC is \"a handheld device that enables users to store and retrieve e-mail, contacts, and appointments, play multimedia files, games, exchange text messages with MSN Messenger, browse the Web, and more.\"\n\nPocket PC is commonly abbreviated as \"PPC\". From a technical standpoint, \"Pocket PC\" is a standard from Microsoft that sets various hardware and software requirements for mobile devices bearing the \"Pocket PC\" label.\n\nFor instance, any device which is to be classified as a Pocket PC must:\n\n• Run Microsoft's Windows CE (Pocket PC version) operating system\n\n• Come bundled with a specific suite of applications in ROM\n\n• Include a touch screen\n\n• Include a directional pad or touchpad (case of HP iPAQ hx4700)\n\n• Include a set of hardware application buttons\n\n• Be based on a ARM version 4 compatible CPU, Intel XScale CPU, MIPS CPU or SH3 CPU. • Pocket PC 2002 (Codename Merlin) works only with ARM-based CPUs.\n\nQuality control and safety represent increasingly important concerns for project managers. Defects or failures in constructed facilities can result in very large costs. Even with minor defects, re-construction may be required and facility operations impaired. Increased costs and delays are the result. In the worst case, failures may cause personal injuries or fatalities. Accidents during the construction process can similarly result in personal injuries and large costs. Indirect costs of insurance, inspection and regulation are increasing rapidly due to these increased direct costs. Good project managers try to ensure that the job is done right the first time and that no major accidents occur on the project. Therefore, inspection process at the construction site is an important process and necessary to be conducted by the construction project supervisor such as engineer and technical assistant to ensure that the construction project is complying to the specify work standard, specification and guide line.\n\nIn order to do so, a study on standard defect checking list in thesis of \"Penyediaan Senarai Semak untuk Pemeriksaan di Tapak Bina bagi Kegunaan Jabatan Kerja Raya, Penampang Sabah\" was carried out for the purpose of identifying the process involve and the problems encountered while carrying out the inspection at the construction site. Later at the end of the research, a standard electronic defect check list which is common use by Public work Department (PWD) had been created. Science this thesis was been done in year 2005, so most of the data and result had been consider up to the date and will be adopted and under taking into count for the support of this research. Besides this, the literature study on the thesis of \"Penyediaan Senarai Semak untuk Pemeriksaan di Tapak Bina bagi Kegunaan Jabatan Kerja Raya, Penampang Sabah\" will be used prior to developing of the interview pilot questionnaire.\n\nFrom the literature study of \"Penyediaan Senarai Semak untuk Pemeriksaan di Tapak Bina bagi Kegunaan Jabatan Kerja Raya, Penampang Sabah\", it is clearly show that check list is one of an important tool for a project manager to supervise the construction site. This thesis also cites one project will become more a manageable and quality and the problem will also become easily trace in the project earlier stage.\n\nBesides this, with the use of check list in construction site supervision, the changes of over look due to human error will also been reduce to minimum.\n\nResult from the thesis literature study also clearly identify out that the common traditional construction process are as listed below. CHECKING ON SITE PREPARATION CHECKING ON STRUCTURE WORKS CHECKING ON ELECTRICAL WORKS CHECKING ON PLUMBING WORKS CHECKING ON FINISHING WORKS CHECKING ON BUILT-IN-FITMENT WORKS PREPARATION OF SITE FACILITIES\n\nResult from the thesis research it had clearly shows that there is a high demanding on personal digital assistant due to the massy construction environment.\n\nResult from the thesis research it had short list out the construction process which mostly need in check list management.\n\nThe thesis study also indicates that the levels of need in check list in construction are clearly showed as below (Table 2.5).\n\nFrom the study, it had show that the industry need more improve to achieve better quality. The suggestions of improvements are show as follow (Table 2.6).\n\nTable 2.6 : Proposal on Improving the Site Checking System No. Proposal on Improving the Site Checking System a) Site Supervisor should has knowledge on checking b) Preparing a quality plan and report on checking c) A on the spot tools needed to record the detail of checking to avoid losing any data and easier in downloading in personnel computer. That particular tool should be user friendly and easier for understanding. Training about the uses of that tools should be provided. d) Keep in touch with the architect and engineer if there is a problems occurred. e) There are at least 2 persons in charge on the site checking. Source: Nelliah Sittor, 2005\n\nAs a conclusion, the thesis of \"Penyediaan Senarai Semak untuk Pemeriksaan di Tapak Bina bagi Kegunaan Jabatan Kerja Raya, Penampang Sabah\" had justified the facts that there is a need of check list in local construction field to counter the existing problem. Never than less the thesis also cited there the construction industry is need of mobile inspection which will transmit has information instantaneously backed to the office.\n\nBesides this, the study on the introduction to wireless communication help on improving the knowledge of how the telecommunication system now day provide their services on information transmitting and retrieving. Nevertheless the background study on Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) feature and history will getting to know the personal digital assistant's feature and function more detail and also increasing the capability of personal digital assistant's usage range in construction field.\n\n\"Good IT is an essential part of improving the efficiency of construction\".\n\n(Sir John Egan,1998)\n\n.\n\nThere are various steps that can be adopted to fulfill the objectives of this study. The research methodology for this research includes discussion on method of data collection, the approach used, research consideration such as design of questionnaire and data analysis.\n\nThe research process for this thesis mainly was divided in to 2 phases. In the first phases, this research involve literature reviews, an industry interview will be conducted on construction firm to identify the most commonly used standard checklist. A pilot questionnaire, drafted from the findings of literature will be used prior to developing of the interview questionnaire. Analysis of data from the interview questionnaire will be conducted for selecting and ranking of the most common use defect check list. Data collection for interview in this study will carried out within the Perak and Johor. Data collection is made through by interview the potential contractor or developer face to face. After that data will be analyze using\n\nStatistical Package for Science Social 11.0 (SPSS).\n\nLater on, in second phases of this research will involve the rapid prototyping method in process of creating prototype development of a prototype as a primary platform for defect check list which will use in PDA.\n\nThe main aim in carrying out the literature reviews is to ensure basic understanding of the topic itself. It is also a method to analyze former study within the scope of the topic. It has been done by referring to articles, journals, paperwork, thesis and also relevant books. For this study, the related books that related to Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) As A Mobile Inspection System At Construction is limited number, so journal papers and proceeding help the researcher to get the information.\n\nThis research also review on the previous researcher's research on \"Penyediaan Senarai Semak Untuk Pemariksaan Di Tapak Bina Bagi Jabatan Kerja Raya Penampang Sabah\" (Nelliah Sittor, 2005) to retrieve the standard defect check list which will use in the construction. Later, a pilot questionnaire, drafted from the findings of literature will be used prior to developing of the interview questionnaire.\n\nInterview will be carried out with the management level officer from the developer or the contractor at construction industry with the questionnaire which had been develop from literature review to determine the most common and practical used defect check list.\n\nBasically the interview question will design into 3 parts for try to gathering the information about defect management in the company from the interviewer and the sample are provided in Appendix A.\n\nIn this part the question will design to get the background and basic information of the interviewer. Besides this, this part will also try to determine how experience is the targeted interviewer which will be used to later in judging the performance of the prototype.\n\nIn this part, the question of interview will be design to approach the interviewer to find out how is the current defect business process exists in their existence company and what is specification they need if there is such defect inspection prototype.\n\nIn this part, the interview question will design to find out how well is the company make good use in Information Technology (IT) to manage their daily defect communication with outsider and insider.\n\nIn order for develop a system which will cater PDA's functionality web application in web portal, earlier stage of system concept will be design using the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) technique for activity modeling to show the input and output and also a breakdown of each of the main process (De Marco, 1978). Later in order to develop a prototype, a rapid prototyping method will be adopted.\n\nIn rapid prototyping interactive prototypes are developed which can be quickly replaced or changed in line with design feedback. This feedback may be derived from colleagues or users as they work with the prototype to accomplish set tasks (Figure 3.1).\n\nThis method is concerned with developing different proposed concepts through software or hardware prototypes, and evaluating them. In general the process is termed 'rapid' prototyping. The development of a simulation or prototype of the future system can be very helpful, allowing users to visualize the system and provide feedback on it. Thus it can be used to clarify user requirements options. Later on in the lifecycle, it can also be used to specify details of the user interface to be included in the future system.\n\nA general procedure for adopting the rapid prototyping method is outlined below:a. Allow enough time to create the prototype. If the prototype is to be evaluated with users then allow time to design relevant tasks, recruit the users, evaluate the prototype and report the results.\n\nb. Assemble the necessary equipment, including the hardware and software tools necessary to create the interactive prototype.\n\nc. Develop the prototype itself.\n\nd. Select appropriate users to test the prototype, trying to cover the range of users within the target population. A facilitator will also be required to instruct the users and run the evaluation.\n\ne. Prepare realistic tasks to occupy the users as they work with the prototype.\n\nf. Pilot the evaluation procedure and ensure the prototype can be used to accomplish the tasks.\n\ng. Ensure recording facilities are available and functioning.\n\nh. Conduct each session. The facilitator instructs the user to work through the allocated tasks, interacting with, and responding to, the system as appropriate.\n\ni. If necessary additional information can be obtained by interviewing users following their use of the prototype. Debrief and thank the user.\n\nj. Analyze the obtained information and then summaries the observations and user evaluations. Determine the themes and severity of the problems identified.\n\nk. Summaries design implications and recommendations for improvements and feed back to design team. Video recordings can support this.\n\nl. Where necessary refine the prototype and repeat the above process.\n\nWhen using this method, it is important avoid spending too long on the development of initial prototypes as user evaluation may result in substantial changes. Also, avoid making the prototype too polished as this may force users to accept it as finished. Do not put in features that will raise the users expectations but which are unlikely to be achieved with the real system (e.g. too fast response times, too sophisticated graphics) and do not put too much effort into particular features (e.g. animations) which may not be required.\n\nWhen user are satisfy with the prototype been develop using rapid prototyping method, the prototype will be try run in a real construction area with the input of realistic data. Later, the comparison in using traditional method of inspection system with new mobile inspection system will carried out and the result of this comparison will be used as the indicator to show the result of this research.\n\nAs a conclusion of the research method, all the literature review of PDA in construction, the review of the standard electronic checklist and the interview will be done in the first phase of this research. However, the system concept design using the DFD modeling technique and the prototype development using rapid prototyping method will be carried out in the second phase. The successful of this research will be shown at the result from the comparison of using traditional method of inspection system with new mobile inspection system.\n\nSince the data collection are from interviewing the managing or directing personnel at Developer Company. As a result, the data which collected will qualitative data. Content analysis will carried out after reviewing the short note written down during the interview and latter the data will be assign a coding to pieces of text that represent either important concepts, common patterns between respondents, or distinct responses by different subgroups. Isolate text associated with each code and then group it together by category. Categories can be predetermined (chosen at the time the instrument is developed) or emergent (chosen after examining the data).\n\nIt's usually best to start by generating numerous codes as you read through responses, identifying data that are related without worrying about the variety of categories. Because codes are not always mutually exclusive, a piece of information might be assigned several codes.\n\nAfter initial coding, it is helpful to review codes and eliminate less useful\n\nones, combine smaller categories into larger ones, or if a very large number of responses have been assigned the same code, subdivide that category. At this stage you should see repeating ideas and can begin organizing codes into larger themes that connect different codes. It may help to spread responses across a floor or large table when trying to identify themes.\n\nTo analysis this section, the initial coding used is word of \"defect\". Then by care fully study through the interview note, it can be conclude that from the data analysis, the data shows that 3 out of 5 of the developer do use a proper defect check list to carried out their daily defect inspection job. This is about 60 % of the respondent do agree that they use a defect inspection list.\n\nThe other 40% of respondent are use of quality inspection form to carry out their defect inspection job.\n\n60% 40% USE DEFECT INSPECTION LIST USE QUALITY CHECK LIST 4.2.1.1 Comparison of Defect Inspection Check List as Criteria to Select Test\n\nDue to this project prototype is develop base on the standard defect inspection form, there fore the defect inspection check list similarity is the priority to determine which company will be chosen as a sample of prototype testing field.\n\nFrom the interview data collection at all the company, the company who use the defect inspection list in their defect checking work been selected, and their defect checking list was been collected to analysis the similarity of defect checking item compare with the standard inspection list which is been produce in previous thesis.\n\nAs a result from that the Company A was been chosen.\n\nPoor communication has long been a problem in the Project Management.\n\nPart of the trouble is the way the industry is organized. The project team is made up of people from many different firms. Their contributions vary and a lot of information has to pass among them. This requires a well-organized network of communication. Even when this network exists, communication still breaks down at a personal level, because people fail to keep their messages simple; they pass on too much information or too little; the information they give is inaccurate or misleading (Fryer, 2002).\n\nAs a result from the interview, it show that number of a layer of organization need to pass through in order to reach down site personnel or contractor  Decision Making Mana ging Technical Field Personnel Direct Labour PROJECT DIRECTOR PROJECT MANAGER SITE MANAGER QUANTITY SURVEYOR SITE ENGINEER1 CLERK OF WORK 1 CLERK OF WORK 2 CLERK OF WORK 3 CLERK OF WORK 4 CONSULTANT ARCHITECT CONTRACTOR BY TRADE\n\nFrom the result of the analysis before show that there is a need of automation defect management system which is design to eliminate the data reentry problems and also automation in documentary management. Therefore a system in auto generation of standard defect inspection report will be design and the information entry is list out as sample form (Form 4.1) below.\n\nFrom the literature study at section 2.8, it had clearly showed out the construction industry now days are needed a mobile defect inspection system.\n\nTherefore a new Mobile Defect Inspection System (MDIS) prototype which is design to manage and inspect the defect to more effectively and up to a state where there is a time and cost saving and also reduce the work load. And is so simple and easy to use since there is no installation required or high computer skill is needed.\n\nWith combining the Mobile Device technology, Cellular Network support and\n\nPortal support, real time data entry can be done easily in to this defect management system Portal Server and then the current defect scenario at the construction site will been reported. Defect inspection process can be done easily by using the mobile device for defect data and picture recording at any where any time without carrying a heavy plan or a bunch defect recording sheet (Figure 4.6).\n\nWith the Automation feature of portal, a defect repot will created to a correspondent party to respond instantly. And by the mean time the administrator also can make their decision or judgment base on the real time defect report update from the system.\n\nFinally, since this system is automation, easy data entry and respond instantly.\n\nProblems of Data missing, data reentry or fragmentation in defect communication will be solved. Besides this each party involve in this system will bring to more closely on each other.\n\nThe construction industry involves several disciplines with a complex network of communications between these disciplines (Egan, 1998). Currently, all the stakeholders in a construction project communicate with one another individually with faxes, telephone networks and in some cases via electronic mail (Hibberd, 2000).\n\nThis kind of one-to-one correspondence can make the communication network very complex resulting in a \"spider web\" network So, in here the traditional business process will be reengineering. From the result of the Figure 2 in interview analysis, it show out the targeted company is now facing a traditional chaos in the defect communication (Figure 4.7), therefore a database which function as a centralized server (Figure 4.8) will be created to server a multi party communication and also information sharing. Figure 4.8 : Centralized Network 4.3.1.1 DFD of Inspection Process The data flow diagram (DFD) is an excellent communication tool for analysis to model process and functional requirements. It is the graphical presentation of system showing their active components and data interface between them. DFD was one of the primary tools of the structure analysis efforts in the year of 1970's. It was develop and enhanced by Yourdon, McMenamin, Palmer, Gane and Sarson and until today, the DFD still consider as a best mdelling techniques for eliciting and\n\nrepresenting the processing requirement of a system (Zamri M et al, 2004).\n\nCONSULTANT ENGINEER 2 PROJECT MNAGER CLERK OF WORK 2 ARCHITECT CONTRACTOR BY TRADE QUANTITY SURVEYOR SITE MANAGER DIRECTOR CONSULTANT ENGINEER 2 PROJECT MNAGER CLERK OF WORK 2 ARCHITECT CONTRACTOR BY TRADE QUANTITY SURVEYOR SITE MANAGER DIRECTOR Database Server DFD diagram been created after the reengineering Defect Inspection Process, for the purpose to identifying the data entry require. Beside this, the DFD also help in showing the type of information and entity related in the process flow. Therefore DFD for targeted company had been created as Figure 4.11. From the DFD above, it clearly shows that the data entry needed to be download by the portal to inspector's PPC are: -1. A Selected standard defect Inspection list form 2. Listed PTD need to be Inspect 3. List of Inspection type 4. Type of Building And the feed back from the inspector PPC to portal system was a filled selected standard defect inspection form which contained :-1. PTD number of the houses contain defect 2. Condition of defect at particular selected defect type 3. Location of the defect 4. Contractor responsible 5. Comment 6. Picture (if any)\n\nAfter all the information was completely send to the database portal, then the output from the portal of MDIS system will automatically generate a list defect report to a responsible contractor and also a report to system administrator about the currently number of logged defect and the number of defect completely been fixed (Figure 4.12). 4.3.1.2 Introduction to Data Modeling Overview A data model is a conceptual representation of the data structures that are required by a database. The data structures include the data objects, the associations between data objects, and the rules which govern operations on the objects. As the name implies, the data model focuses on what data is required and how it should be organized rather than what operations will be performed on the data. To use a common analogy, the data model is equivalent to an architect's building plans.\n\nFrom the DFD diagram Figure 4.13 above, it already show that the data and the input that need to feed in the database system in order to process and keep the record of defect logged by the field inspector, a brief draft map of the database of MDIS had been created as Figure 18 below.\n\nA part which consist of basic information of all the employee involve in the project team and it is including the inspector's background information which will be use to assign to a selected project defect inspection.\n\nA part consist of level information which is use for accessing a multi storied building\n\nA part which hold information of section in a building, example: Car park, Master Bedroom and Kitchen.\n\nA part where all the necessary basic background information of contractor will be store at. Example: Contractor's trade\n\nPTD number was a very unique lot number which is register and assign by the land office of Malaysia to a particular lot of land or property, therefore this section will hole the information of the PTD number which will be use as a unique primary key to store defect information.\n\nIn the creation of database, Microsoft Access was been choose as a primary software use to manage and creation of this MDIS database in earlier stage, because due to the good database creation and management feature which is design in the Microsoft Access. Later when in the implementation of MDIS in the web portal,\n\nActive Server Language will be use to access server for retrieve and update of MDIS portal database.\n\nThe Entity-Relationship (ER) model was originally proposed by Peter in 1976\n\n[Chen76] as a way to unify the network and relational database views. Simply stated the ER model is a conceptual data model that views the real world as entities and relationships. A basic component of the model is the Entity-Relationship diagram which is used to visually represent data objects. Since Chen wrote his paper the model has been extended and today it is commonly used for database design for the database designer, the utility of the ER model is:\n\n• It maps well to the relational model. The constructs used in the ER model can easily be transformed into relational tables.\n\n• It is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training. Therefore, the model can be used by the database designer to communicate the design to the end user.\n\n• In addition, the model can be used as a design plan by the database developer to implement a data model in specific database management software.\n\nEntities are the principal data object about which information is to be collected. Entities are usually recognizable concepts, either concrete or abstract, such as person, places, things, or events which have relevance to the database. Some specific examples of entities are employees, projects, location. An entity is analogous to a table in the relational model. The mobile support part in MDIS system is design to let user to enter the data and information at any place and any time. This mean the user need not back to office for renter the data back into the work station and process the data, because all the data and information of this MDIS is store in the internet portal server. Therefore, the user of the MDIS system can retrieve and store information where ever they go and where ever the site is located, provided as long as there is a cellular network signal and can connect to internet.\n\nThis MDIS system are design to connect to internet using cellular network because the cellular network was the most far area coverage then using a signal  However on the other hand, the MDIS system also designs to including the non moveable unit such as work station in the office. This is to serve the purpose of defect report reference system to contractor who involve in the project and also to serve the purpose of system admin in database maintenance and also MDIS core system maintenance.\n\nTo use this MDIS system in the mobile unit, it is suggests that the POCKET PC is require to serve the best performance due to multiple functional feature (Detail of the feature has been discussed in Chapter 2). However the basic hardware specification for mobile unit to use the MDIS system shows at\n\nTable 4.2. On the other hand, the hardware requirements to serve the best performance of in moveable unit such a workstation are show as the Table 4.3 below.\n\nTable 4.3: Hardware Requirement for Workstation Unit Type IBM compatible personal computer Processor Pentium ( or equivalent) processor ( 800 MHz or above recommended ) Ram 64 Mb ( 128 recommended ) O/S Microsoft Windows 98 and above Connectivity Via Cable modem in 50k or Via ASDL modem in STREAMYX\n\nSoftware requirement for MDIS at the workstation is not limited due to the OS provided is powerful enough to process the IO from the workstation hardware.\n\nAs mentioned in earlier, the MDIS system is design to support across two different OS platform which is Win CE and Standard Microsoft Windows 98 and above, therefore it is important to select a language which can communicate between these two different OS platform. Besides this, never to forget also that the MDIS is an application which need to design and operate in a Internet Information Service (IIS)\n\nserver to retrieve and save information inside the server database (Figure 4.17).\n\nTherefore, in this MDIS project, Active Server Page Language (ASP), Visual Basic (VB) Language and JAVA was use a medium which communicate through the three different platforms. ASP language was use as the primary medium to interact most of the process server instruction between these three different platforms.\n\nFollowing by was the VB language which use in some form design and security checksum, and JAVA language was been used in the table form controlling for Graphics User Interface (GUI).\n\nAlthough the JAVA language is involve in the controlling of table form GUI, but the orientation and presentation of information to the user at different platform was control by the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).\n\nFor the information database retrieval at portal server, it is control by using the ActiveX Data Object (ADO) method in order to connect the user to the database.\n\nAfter the been connected to the database, it is good to using Structured Query Language (SQL) to retrieve the data or the information in the manner or the way as end user require. 4.3.2.3 System Architectural System architectural of MDIS basically is support by 9 functional modules. Each module function is unique and interacting in each other so that it serve the function of database management and control , OS detection and GUI control, image processing, information access security control by level and group, data export, data print, report auto generation, database acquisition and data post. a. Database Management and Control\n\nThe function of this module is to collect and save the data which user post in into database storage in the server. This module also serves as a functional module in retrieve database or information from the server database storage upon query from user. This module retrieves the data from the database using ADODB method as show in the ASP source code in Table 4.4.\n\nThe function of this module is to control the print out from the webpage. This because some time the content of some web page is too long and more then a page.\n\nAnd if printing the web page content direct from the browser, the information at print out some time will be disarrange. Therefore it is necessary to have a module to control the information layout cut off per page. And In the MDIS system, a JAVA script once again had been used to serve the purpose (Table 4.8).\n\nBesides, MDIS can be use at Pocket PC, this system is also allow another access the real time data Online. This had given a large room of convenient to the user to monitor their project from far away with just access into internet.\n\n• Firstly user need to login with an appropriate user id and password.\n\n• Then click Login button to login in to MDIS system\n\nThe MDIS system will automatically generate brief view of the current status in defect management once the Administration is logon Here MDIS also allow the Administrator and staff to edit or enter the data through the side Menu\n\nAlthough every one can enter information but some menu is limit to the use of Administrator only. E.g. Employee Menu\n\nOffice user also got a function to edit and record the data same as the function in POCKET PC report via click the \"Print This Page\" button.\n\nTo test the prototype, the targeted developer had given a selected 85 unit of double storey house which already in the defect inspection phase (Figure 4.20) as a test field for MDIS prototype. Beside the basic information of the construction site, other site plan will be refereed to extract some information such as compartment which allocate for the houses and the interviewer from the developer is invited for MDIS prototype demonstration. But at a day before prototype try out at the construction site, a short briefing on operating MDIS prototype is undergo with the targeted site manager and the prototype user manual also been provided to the targeted site manager.\n\nAfter gathering all the information and then insert those information into the server, the MDIS system is ready to operate. But a few advice on mobile unit preparation need to notice before carried out the inspection operation which is: -\n\n• Make sure Pocket PC is fully charge\n\n• Try to clear as much space in memory as possible for use in storage of picture. • Spare extra one SD memory module if can in case of unexpected memory space shortage error occurrences.\n\n• Try not to adjust the screen backlight to maximum because it is battery consuming • If can, try to get one hard casing for pocket pc to protect it from unexpected fallen object and also for dust prevention.\n\n• Upload the necessary reference information such as PTD number and basic information such as inspection number, inspector name, project name and contractor who involve in this project in advance.\n\n• If the pocket pc is without camera, user can use a choice either using the camera from the cell phone unit then later transfer the picture from cell phone unit to pocket PC via Bluetooth synchronization.\n\n• If the pocket pc needs to use cell phone as a dial up modem via Bluetooth, then the pairing process between these two devices must be done in advance.\n\n• For the best connection speed, user can had their own choice in selecting some fast internet service such as EDGE or 3G from the local cellular provider (Table 4.11).\n\n11 questions about various aspects of the prototype system were asked in this section.\n\nFor each question in section B, participants were asked to tick the box that best represents their assessment on the scale of 1 (poor), 2 (fair), 3 (satisfactory), 4 (good) and 5 (excellent). It was divided into the following three sub headings:\n\n• The System Performance • Applicability to Construction Industry\n\nIn this part, the participant is requested to give two comments, including the main benefits of the prototype system and ways to improve the system.\n\nThis section reports feedback from the evaluation participants that responses to the questions and give comments for further improvements. Generally, the targeted evaluation respond personnel are site manager, site engineer and clerk of work from that construction project. The Table 5.1 shows the result from the evaluation of the prototype on the aspect of system performance, applicability to construction industry and general rating of the prototype. Table 5.2 shows the additional comment from the respondent.\n\n• Please add an extra language such as Malay Language • Put less picture during logon to increase loading speed • Need a more proper user teaching guide • Need more detail inspection layer • Insert a part which can more collaborative between inter organization in term of documentation management • The set up cost will be expensive Generally the respondent had rate the MDIS prototype as excellent because the prototype give a user friendly environment to the user (Figure 5.1).\n\nOn the other hand, most of the respondents (40%) had rate the MDIS prototype as good, only when they were asked about its applicability to construction industry (Figure 5.2). The overall rating by the respondent to the prototype was excellent because due to the design of the prototype is much fulfilling the need of the respondent in defect management (Figure 5.3). The respondent also had some additional comment to the prototype to improve the flexibility of prototype into their organization (Table 5.2).\n\nBesides the additional comment, the respondent also give comments on the benefit of the prototype to the construction industry (Table 5.3).\n\n0% 13% 20% 40% 27% POOR FAIR SATISFACTORY GOOD EXCELLENT 0% 0% 25% 33% 42% POOR FAIR SATISFACTORY GOOD EXCELLENT\n\nTable 5.3: Benefit of the Prototype\n\nThe prototype had manage to process the document in standardize way; therefore it help in improve a quality.\n\nThe prototype had help in reduce the number of inspection personnel went back to office for data re entry.\n\nThese prototypes can accompany a photograph with report at a same time; therefore it helps in reduce my work on photograph short out.\n\nNow I can assign my staff to in charge of defect inspection on a multiple site.\n\nIs good to have the automatic report generating for contractor to catch up.\n\nThis prototype help in reduce the chances of miss recorded defect and there fore it help me in keep out of double return to fix the defect.\n\nAs a result from the evaluation (Table 5. e. Eliminate delays in communicating defects reports to contractors.\n\nFrom the evaluation process, the MDIS prototype have several limitations as follow:\n\n• The set up cost for the prototype will be slightly expensive.\n\n• Wireless signal have some interference if the inspection is done in the confine or closure locations.\n\n• Speeds of the cellular network are some time unstable and inconstant, and this will affect the data transmitting speed of the prototype.\n\nThis chapter has described the summative evaluation of the prototype system. The research adopted questionnaire techniques in evaluating the prototype system. The results from the evaluation show that the prototype system has an overall good performance base on the demonstration session. Although the prototype concept is still new to the construction industry, yet the respondent agreed that this prototype concept will be adopted in future. Finally, the limitations of prototype, comments and suggestions from the evaluation were used to refine the prototype system.\n\nCHAPTER 6 6CONCLUSION\n\nThis chapter seeks to summarize and provide conclusion to the research as well as recommendations for future improvement and development. It also conclude its targeted aim and objectives.\n\nThe discussions herein reflect the accomplishment of each specific objective:\n\nObjective 1: To review the inspection process and standard check list used in practice at construction site.\n\nThis objective was achieved base on the execution of extensive literature reviews and background research. From the review it indicates that:-I.\n\nThere is a common standard defect inspection process involve in every stages of the construction process (Figure 2.3).\n\nFrom the standard defect inspection process, the activity which need most check list to aid and help in the inspection process was been identified (Table 2.4).\n\nFrom the proposal of inspection process, it clearly shows that there is the need of quality plan and report on the defect inspection (Table 2.6).\n\nObjective 2: To identify the potential at and requirement for mobile inspection system at construction site.\n\nThis objective was achieved base on the execution of extensive literature reviews and background research and the study indicate that:-I.\n\nThe local construction industry had shown that there was potential and requirement of using Pocket Pc in the construction industry and the result was as shown in the Table 2.3.\n\nThe literature study also showed that on level of need in standard electronic check list at varied construction works Table 2.5.\n\nObjective 3: To develop a prototype at a mobile inspection system for construction site.\n\nThrough the rapid prototyping technique, a mobile defect inspection system (MDIS) prototype was develop and tested to achieve this final objective. From the evaluation of the prototype at a construction site, it was reported that:-I.\n\nThe respondent had rate the MDIS prototype as excellent in system performance because the prototype can give a quite user friendly environment to the user. Beside this, the respondent do finds the prototype did a well defect communication between the parties involve (Figure 5.1).\n\nThe respondents had rate the MDIS prototype as good base on the applicability to construction industry because this kind of inspection system is still new to the industry, but the effort to try and implementation in the construction industry was encouraging (Figure 5.2).\n\nThe overall rating by the respondent to the prototype was in excellent because due to the design of the prototype is much fulfilling the need of the respondent in defect management (Figure 5.3).\n\nFrom the research findings, the user of MDIS system had recommended that the following suggestions to be adapted for future improvement and enhancement of the mobile defect inspection system.\n\nI. Add an extra language such as Malay Language in getting wider range of user and also flexibility in user readings; beside this the additional language can also bring the beneficial of prototype to more groups of people especially the lower layer in organizations.\n\nII. Insert less and only necessary picture during security logon to increase loading speed due to the fact that a high pixel picture are consist of large size, therefore the loading in overall of the prototype was slow.\n\nIII. Need proper user teaching guide.\n\nIV. Insert a part which can more collaborative between inter organization in term of documentation management which will collaborate not just only the defect management document but also other document.\n\nThis research generally had identified a number of areas which could be carried out for further research, therefore several possible suggestions were listed as follow:\n\nI.\n\nFurther study could be conducted in adding an additional module which related to contractor's claim control base on the reported fix defect condition.\n\nBesides this, adding a collaborative module which interact with other material quantity control program or software in term of proper controlling and monitoring would be encourage beneficial.\n\nResearch in how to adapt a construction safety management feature into the MDIS prototype could be conducted due to both defect and safety are likely in the same characteristic in providing better work quality.\n\nSource: (http:// www.Microsoft.com/mobile/pocketpc/pdainfo.asp Aug. 6, 2004) \"Helpful facts about personal digital assistants''\n\nSource: Nelliah Sittor, 2005\n\nSource: Nelliah Sittor, 2005\n\nThe function of this module is to export the database for use of other office documentation application such as Microsoft excel, Microsoft words, CSV (comma separated values) and xml."
