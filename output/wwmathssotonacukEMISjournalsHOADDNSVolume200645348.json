    "abstract": "We have used empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, which is especially well fitted for analyzing time-series data representing nonstationary and nonlinear processes. This method could decompose any time-varying data into a finite set of functions called \"intrinsic mode functions\" (IMFs). The EMD analysis successively extracts the IMFs with the highest local temporal frequencies in a recursive way. The extracted IMFs represent a set of successive low-pass spatial filters based entirely on the properties exhibited by the data. The IMFs are mutually orthogonal and more effective in isolating physical processes of various time scales. The results showed that most of the IMFs have normal distribution. Therefore, the energy density distribution of IMF samples satisfies χ 2 -distribution which is statistically significant. This study suggested that the recent global warming along with decadal climate variability contributes not only to the more extreme warm events, but also to more frequent, long lasting drought and flood.",
    "full_text": "Several linear statistical models have been applied to climatic data (Rajagopalan et al. [19,20], Harrison and Larkin [11], and Wunsch [27]), but the results are not conclusive due to the high sensitivity of model results to model parameters (Rajagopalan et al. [19,20] and Harrison and Larkin [11]), especially when stochastic processes are taken into account (Wunsch [27]).\n\nA new nonlinear technique, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), has recently been pioneered by Huang et al. [13] for adaptively representing nonstationary time-series data. Although it proved remarkably effective (Huang et al. [13] and Wu et al. [26]), the technique is faced with the difficulty of being essentially defined by an algorithm and therefore does not admit an analytical formulation which would allow for a theoretical analysis and performance evaluation.\n\nSpatial rainfall data contain information of a broad range of spatial scales (Pegram and Clothier [18]; Harries et al. [10] and Turner et al. [23]). The technique employed is a two-dimensional generalization of the one-dimensional EMD technique introduced by Huang et al. [13]. In a single dimension, EMD analysis produces a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that are very nearly orthogonal. The key contribution of Sinclair and Pegram [22] paper is to introduce the concept of 2D EMD to the hydrometeorological literature as a tool for the analysis of spatio-temporal rainfall data. The EMD algorithm copes with stationary by ignoring the concept, embracing nonstationary as a practical reality. Although EMD is relatively new data analysis technique, its power and simplicity have encouraged its application in different fields.\n\nThe El Nino and the southern oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) is the primary driver of interannual climate variability and has a large economic and social impact over the universe (Glantz et al. [8]). Fedorov and Philander [6] demonstrated that mean fluctuations of decadal timescale do contribute significantly to the later unusual ENSO events and suggested that global warming cannot be ruled out as a suspect (Wu et al. 2002).\n\nChiew et al. [3] examine the one-dimensional EMD of several annual stream flow time series to search for significant trends in the data, using bootstrapping to test the statistical significance of identified trends. The technique has been extensively used in ocean wave data analysis (Huang et al. [12]; Hwang et al. [15]) as well as in the analysis of polar ice cover (Gloersen and Huang, [9]). EMD has also been applied in the analysis of seismological data by Zhang et al. [28] and also has been used to diagnose heart beat rate fluctuations (Balocchi et al. [1]). Also some used in signal image processing (Flandrin et al. [7]).\n\nGlobal climate change is one of the most controversial issues to the scientific community. Some of the most important data associated with global climate change is rainfall. Global warming is one of the most serious global environmental issues facing mankind. Climate is a fundamental component of the Earth's natural system. Effect of global warming is already visible. The global mean temperature has increased by 0.6 • C over the last century and many organisms and ecosystems have experienced changes. There is a perception that extreme natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and heat waves have become more frequent. This change in climate plays an important role in the Earth's sustainability.\n\n2.1. Rainfall data. All the weather parameters were measured with instruments specified by India Meteorological Department, Government of India. Daily rainfall data were collected from the Agricultural Experimental Farm, Indian Statistical Institute, Giridih, Jharkhand for the years 1989 to 2004. Rainfall was measured with IMD specified manual and automatic rain gauges. Onset of monsoon during different years was identified as the week which received more than 20 mm of rain in 1 or 2 consecutive days, provided that the probability of at least 10 mm of rain in the subsequent week is more than 0.7 (Virmani [24]). Similarly, the date of withdrawal of monsoon is defined as the date up to which a rainfall of at least 30 mm has been received in a week with no subsequent rainfall for at least 3 consecutive weeks towards the end the monsoon season (Shanker et al. [21]).\n\nThe empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is recently developed which is specifically designed to analyze the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of a time-series data (Huang et al. [13]; Gloersen and Huang [9]). There is a straightforward assumption for EMD; all the data must consist of simple intrinsic mode of oscillations. The modes, defined by the EMD method called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Figure 2.1 showed the flowchart of IMF computation. EMD naturally separates nonlinear oscillatory patterns of higher frequencies from those of lower frequencies and trend. EMD is very efficient for time-series data (Coughlin and Tung [5]). EMD method separates time-series into intrinsic oscillations using local temporal and structural characteristics of the data. This analysis allows describing the statistical confidence of the study results. The time-series rainfall data is decomposed into locally orthogonal modes using the EMD method (Huang et al. [13]).\n\nThere exist many algorithmic approaches of EMD (Flandrin et al. [7]; Ivan and Richard [16]). Time-series data x(t) can be decomposed by EMD as follows:\n\n(1) identify the extrema (both maxima and minima) of data x(t);\n\n(2) generate the upper and lower envelopes h(t) and l(t), respectively, by connecting the maxima and minima points separately with cubic spline interpolation; (3) determine the local mean m 1 (t) = (h(t) + l(t))/2; (4) IMF should have zero local mean, subtract out m 1 from x(t) g 1 (t) = x(t) -m 1 (t);\n\n(2.1)\n\n(5) test whether g 1 (t) is an IMF or not; (6) repeat steps 1 to 5 and end up with an IMF g 1 (t). Once the first IMF is derived, define C 1 (t) = g 1 (t), this is the finest temporal scale in the time-series data, that is, the shortest period component of the data x(t). To find all the IMFs, generate the residue r 1 (t) of the data by subtracting out C 1 (t) from the data as\n\n(2.\n\n2)\n\nThe residue now contains information about the components for longer period; it is treated as the new data and is resifted to find additional components.\n\nThe sifting process will be continued until it meets a stopping criterion as in Flandrin et al. [7] yielding the subsequent IMFs as well as residues and the result is\n\nwhere r n (t) becomes a constant, a monotonic function, or a function with only maxima and one minima from which no more IMF can be derived, Huang et al. [14]. At the end\n\nCompute mean envelope m(t)\n\nUpper and lower envelope fits by spline interpolation\n\nLocal maxima and minima extraction of the decomposition the signal x(t) is represented as\n\nwhere n is the number of IMFs and r n (t) is the final residue. Within the entire decomposition, it takes maximum of 810 iterations to generate an IMF. The IMFs are interpreted as the basis vectors representing the data (Wu and Huang [25]). The EMD can also be treated as dyadic filter bank (Flandrin et al. [7]; Wu and Huang [25]). Each IMF is considered as a bandpass filter (Flandrin et al. [7]); the mean period of any IMF component almost exactly doubles that of the previous one, the Fourier spectra of the IMF components are identical in shape as well as cover the same area on a semilogarithmic period scale (Wu and Huang [25]). It can effectively be applied to the data without harmonics, whereas any harmonic analysis (Fourier, wavelet and so on) would end up in the same context with a much less compact and physically less meaningful decomposition (Chang et al. [2]). The focus in this study will be mainly on the most recent climate records. The data analysis is performed by self-written Matlab programs.\n\nThe data of this investigation has no certainty to contain the harmonic components and EMD is the best-suited method to analyze. The 15-year daily rainfall data and the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are shown in Figure 3.1. The EMD method is very effective on a climate data, the IMFs components are normally distributed and also the energy density of IMF is χ 2 -distribution. This result is consistent with the findings of Wu and Huang [25]. The results are statistically significant of information content for IMF components.\n\nThe instantaneous frequency (IF) represents the signal's frequency at every time instance. IF is defined as the rate of change of the phase angle at the analysis time instant of the analytic version of the signal. Every IMF is a real valued signal and analytic signal method (Cooke [4]) is used to calculate the instantaneous frequency of the IMFs.\n\nThe analytic (complex) signal corresponding to a real signal ith IMF C i (t) is defined as\n\nwhere H[•] is the Hilbert transform operator, a i (t) and θ i (t) are instantaneous amplitude and phase, respectively, of the ith IMF. The Hilbert transform provides a phase shift of ±π/2 to all frequency components, whilst leaving the magnitudes unchanged (Cooke [4]). For any arbitrary time-series X(t), the Hilbert transform Y (t) is defined as\n\nwhere P indicates the Cauchy principal value. With the definition, X(t) and Y (t) form a complex conjugate yielding the analytic signal Z(t) = X(t) + jY(t). The analytic signal is advantageous in determining the instantaneous quantities such as energy, phase, and frequency. So the corresponding instantaneous frequency of the ith IMF can easily be derived as   Hilbert transform on each IMF component, the data can be expressed as\n\nwhere only the n IMFs are taken into consideration leaving the residue (Huang et al. [13]). This expression enables to represent the amplitude and instantaneous frequency as a function of time in a three-dimensional plot. This frequency-time distribution of amplitude is designated as Hilbert amplitude spectrum H(ω,t) or simply Hilbert spectrum.\n\nTo build H(ω,t), the instantaneous frequency of each IMF is first scaled according to the given number of frequency bins. Figure 3.2 represents the Hilbert spectrum (HS) of the rainfall data as shown in Figure 3.1 using 256 frequency bins.\n\nThe HS can visualize the data in time and frequency scales at the same time. Regarding the rainfall data, HS makes clear analysis about the distribution and amount of frequent and nonfrequent rainfall at any time over the entire data length. This type of analysis is very much influential in the study of global warming.\n\nThere are various forms to present the Hilbert spectrum, the popular form is the color map presentation as shown in Figure 3.2. Any point in the color map presentation corresponds to the energy in dB (determined by the color bar placed at the right side of the HS) at any specific time and frequency.\n\nIn this study, the visualization is more preferable than the further processing of the Hilbert spectrum. The smoothened version of the original HS of time-frequency domain becomes more understandable than any one of the previous representations.\n\nThe marginal spectrum defines a measure of total energy contribution from each frequency value. It represents the cumulated amplitude over the entire data length in a probabilistic sense. As we have already derived the Hilbert spectrum H(ω,t), the marginal spectrum h(ω) can be easily defined as\n\n(3.5) Figure 3.5 shows the marginal Hilbert spectrum (solid line) as well as the Fourier spectrum (dotted line). These two spectra actually offer different meaning. In Fourier spectrum, the existence of energy at any frequency ω means a component of a sine or a cosine wave persisted through the time span of the data. However, in marginal Hilbert spectrum, the energy at the frequency ω means there is a higher likelihood that an oscillation with such a frequency exists. Comparing the two spectra in Figure 3.5, the Fourier spectrum is merely representing the nature of harmonic analysis without considering the existence of harmonics in the data; whereas, the marginal Hilbert spectrum appears as nonharmonic, data adaptive spectral distribution. It is also representing the real nature of data, for example, the marginal energy is decreasing with the increase of frequency as visualized in Hilbert spectrum. Since there is a less guarantee of having harmonics in the fully discrete rainfall data, EMD is more suited in analysis than using any other harmonic analysis method (e.g., Fourier, wavelet, and so on).\n\nThe study which examines the probability distribution of an individual IMF (C1 to C14) is shown in Figure 3.6. The probability density function for each IMF is approximately normally distributed, which is evident from the superimposed fitted normal distribution function. From the large sample theory, this fit is expected from central limit theorem. Definitely the deviation from the normal distribution function grows as the mode number increases, Figure 3.6. This is because, in the higher-frequency modes, the IMFs contain a smaller number of oscillations; therefore, the number of events decreases and the distribution becomes less smooth. When sample size is large, the IMFs of the higherfrequency modes will have more oscillations and the distribution will follow the normal distribution according to the central limit theorem. The energy of the probability density function theory for a time series that has a normal distribution should have a χ 2distribution (Papoulies [17]). IMFs isolate physical processes of various time scales and also give the temporal variation with the processes in their entirety without resorting to the linear assumptions. The IMFs can show the nonlinear distortion of the waveform locally as discussed by Huang et al. [13] and Wu et al. [26]. Finally, IMFs can be effectively used to construct the time-frequency distribution in the form of a Hilbert spectrum, which offers details of the time variation of the underlying processes.\n\nA new technique for analyzing the special scaling structure of rainfall fields has been discussed. An EMD analysis in linearly decomposes the spatially distributed rainfall data into a set of intrinsic mode functions, which are approximate by mutually orthogonal and sum back to the original data.\n\nThe sum of all the IMF components reconstructs the original data as shown in Figure 3.7. Considering the entire data length, the maximum difference between the original and reconstructed data is of the order 10 -14 as shown in Figure 3  12 Empirical mode decomposition analysis of climate changes 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 Time (year) Original data 0 50 100 150 Daily rainfall (mm) (a) 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 Time (year) Recostructed data from IMFs 0 50 100 150 Daily rainfall (mm) (b) 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 Time (year) Difference between original and recostructed data -2 0 2 4 6 8 ×10 -14 Daily rainfall (mm) (c) Figure 3.7. The reconstructed rainfall data and the error with the original data.\n\nthat EMD is a lossless decomposition and the completeness of the decomposition is thus demonstrated.\n\nTo measure the efficiency of the decomposition the orthogonality of the decomposition should also be checked. The elements should be locally orthogonal to each other. The higher orthogonality corresponds to less amount of information leakage (cross terms of the data between the components) between the elements. The amount of leakage usually depends on the length of data as well as the decomposition method (Huang et al. [13]).\n\nTo check the orthogonality of IMFs from the EMD, an overall index of orthogonality, IO, is defined (Chang et al. [2]) as\n\nwhere l and m stand for the indices of IMFs. The residue is also included to evaluate the IO and that is why l and m are extended to n + 1 instead of n. In the decomposition of the above-described rainfall data the overall IO value is only 0.00025.\n\nMd. Khademul Islam Molla et al. 13 C 2 C 4 C 6 C 8 C 10 C 12 C 14 IMF components Color bar C 2 C 4 C 6 C 8 C 10 The orthogonality can also be measured for any pair of components C l and C m as\n\nA set of perfect orthogonal IMF components will give zero values of IO and IO l,m . In practice, the accepted solution for those with IO and IO l,m are smaller than 0.100. The orthogonality values between all possible pairs of IMF components are shown as the contour map in Figure 3.8. The color value (indicated by the color bar) in the contour map represents the index on orthogonality between the corresponding pair (obtained from xand y-axes) of IMF components. It is noted that the maximum value of the indices of orthogonality is of the order 8 × 10 -5 which is very much less than the proposed value of 0.100. By observing the completeness and orthogonality, the study concluded that the EMD method is well fitted to analyze the mentioned rainfall data.\n\n3.6. Degree of stationarity test. EMD as well as Hilbert spectrum is more suitable for nonstationary data. If h(ω) is the marginal Hilbert spectrum, the mean marginal spectrum μ(ω) = (1/T)h(ω). Then the degree of stationarity (DS) is defined as\n\nIt gives the measure of the degree of stationarity at any frequency over the entire data set and it produces the zero value for a stationary process or data set. With a stationary data set, the Hilbert spectrum is not a function of time; it will consist of only horizontal contour lines. The DS of the rainfall data is shown in Figure 3.9 with 256 frequency bins  (same as the number used in Hilbert spectrum). As the index showed, the data are highly nonstationary especially for the high-frequency components. Also from the scenario by observing the Hilbert spectrum, there exists more regularity in the data at the lower frequency range and less in the higher-frequency bins. This provides a qualitative measure of the degree of stationary. The quantitative measure of DS ensures that the rainfall data is nonstationary and EMD is more suited for analyzing the data.\n\nParameters of IMF components and its properties. Some other properties of the IMF components can also be useful to understand easily the analysis method of 15-year rainfall data. The parameters values computed from the rainfall data are listed in Table 3.1. The mean period (calculated as the total number of extrema divided by the number of data samples) serves the information that how the EMD works as the filter bank in Md. Khademul Islam Molla et al. 15 data analysis. The percentage of energy content represents how much energy of the data is contained by each IMF components and the variance offers the amount of information by corresponding IMF. Finally the number of iteration required to compute individual IMF provides the idea about the computational cost of the analysis. The empirical findings are almost identical to those reported by Flandrin et al. [7].\n\nThis study plays a vital role for analyzing the properties of nonlinear and nonstationary daily rainfall time-series data. This study focuses on the relation between the rainfall variability and global warming using EMD data analyzing method. The results showed that most of the IMFs have normal distribution. Therefore, the energy density distribution of an IMF samples satisfies χ 2 -distribution. An EMD analysis linearly decomposes the spatially distributed rainfall data into a set of intrinsic mode functions, which are approximate by mutually orthogonal and sum back to the original data. The EMD analysis successively extracts the IMFs starting with the highest local spatial frequencies in a recursive way, which is effectively a set of successive low-pass spatial filters based entirely on the properties exhibited by the data. The IMFs are more effective in isolating physical processes of various time scales and also statistically significant. The major peak of frequencies also appears to be located around the peaks of the decadal variability. The results of this study indicate that this may be the response to decadal climate variability and global warming. The EMD is a new approach to many researchers in climate research. This study suggests that the recent global warming along with decadal climate variability contributes not only to the more extreme warm events, but also to more frequent, long lasting drought and flood."
