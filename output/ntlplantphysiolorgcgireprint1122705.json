    "abstract": "In an Arabidopsis thaliana T87-C3 cell-suspension culture, entry into the growth-arrest phase is rapidly followed by a loss of cell viability. Three cDNA clones, SRGI, SRG2, and SRG3, corresponding to genes with transcripts that accumulate during these late phases, were isolated by the mRNA differential display method. Amino acid sequence analysis shows that the putative SRCl protein is a new member of the Fe(ll)/ascorbate oxidase superfamily, and that SRG2 codes for a protein with significant homology to P-glucosidases. Significantly, all three SRG genes are expressed in senescing organs of Arabidopsis plants. Two previously characterized genes, SAG2 and SAG4, induced during natural senescence in Arabidopsis, were also found to be expressed in cell-suspension cultures and have expression kinetics similar to those observed for the SRGl gene. Taken together these findings suggest that certain molecular events are common to both plant senescence and growth arrest in Arabidopsis cell suspensions. Both internucleosomal cleavage of nDNA and an apparent compaction of chromatin, two characteristic features of programmed cell death in animal cells, have been observed in Arabidopsis cell cultures at a stage corresponding to loss of cell viability.\n~~ ~",
    "full_text": "Cultured cells are now universally recognized as appropriate model systems with which to investigate the molecular responses of plants to stimuli that affect growth, such as nutrient availability (e.g. Roitsch et al., 1995) and plant growth factor requirements (e.g. Teyssendier de la Serve et al., 1985;Dominov et al., 1992;Lee and Chen, 1993). For example, limitations in phosphate concentration (Kodama  et al., 1990; Kock et al., 1995; Malboobi and Lefebvre, 1995), nitrogen supply (Kodama et al., 1990), carbon source (Kodama et al., 1990;Sheu et al., 1994;Hsieh et al., 1995;Tseng et al., 1995), or hormone depletion (Crowell and Amasino, 1991) result in modifications in gene expression, leading to changes in the cellular mRNA pattern.\n\nAfter nutrient exhaustion, certain cell cultures undergo rapid growth arrest, followed by a dramatic loss of viabil-ity. We are currently studying these late phases of the cell culture growth cycle, which exhibit a number of morphological symptoms similar to those that occur in senescing plant tissues, which have recently been described in sugarstarved, cultured rice cells (Chen et al., 1994).\n\nAs a first step toward characterizing the molecular events associated with growth arrest and viability loss, we have attempted to select genes with a relative expression that is enhanced at the end of the growth phase of the cell culture. For this purpose, we chose an Arabidopsis fkaliana cell line (Axelos et al., 1992) with a particularly short growth-arrest period. Transcripts that accumulated at the end of the growth phase of the culture were characterized by the mRNA differential display method (Liang and Pardee, 1992). Three cDNA clones were isolated and the expression patterns of the corresponding genes were analyzed both throughout the cell culture growth cycle and in normal and senescing Arabidopsis plant tissues. These studies and reciproca1 experiments performed with genes already identified as markers of plant senescence (Hensel et al., 1993;Taylor et al., 1993) suggest interesting molecular parallels between growth arrest in cell cultures and the classical senescence of plant tissues. Finally, loss of cell culture viability was found to be accompanied by internucleosomal cleavage of nDNA, suggesting a possible analogy with programmed cell death in animal cells.\n\nAvabidopsis thaliana (ecotype C24) plants were grown at 22°C under white light at a fluency of 230 pE s-' m-' with a 9-h-dayl15-h-night photoperiod. The A. fkaliana T87-C3 cells were cultured under continuous illumination in 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 300 mL of culture medium consisting of either JPL medium prepared according to Axelos et al. (1992) or Gamborg B5 medium (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), 20 g L-l SUC, and 2.5 ~L M 2,4-D. After 12 d, the cells were transferred into fresh medium at a density of 14 g fresh cells L-l. The chlorophyll content of the cells was determined photometrically using the method of Vernon (1960).\n\nOrgans were excised from 4-to 6-week-old plants. Total RNA was extracted from the Arabidopsis cells and from the plant organs with acid guanidinium thiocyanatephenol-chloroform (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). RNA concentrations were determined on the basis of optical density measurements at 260 nm. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA extracts by adsorption onto oligo-(dT),,-coupled paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Total DNA was isolated by the method of Dellaporta et al. (1983), followed by a treatment with heattreated (DNase-free) RNase A (Sigma). Standard techniques of DNA and RNA manipulation were as described by Sambrook et al. (1989).\n\nmRNA Differential Display Differential display analyses were performed according to the original procedure of Liang and Pardee (1992), with the modifications described by Callard et al. (1994). Thirty primer combinations were tested. Three of these, for wluch strongly regulated sequences could be detected (Fig. l), were also used for the isolation of the corresponding cDNAs. The purification of the display products and their cloning in the vector (pBluescript, Stratagene), as well as the elimination of the contaminating cDNA clones, were performed following procedures previously reported (Callard et al., 1994).\n\nEach of the displayed cDNAs, cloned into the vector, was amplified by PCR with the primer combination used in the display reaction and under the reamplification conditions described by Liang and Pardee (1992). The amplification products were then gel-purified and labeled with [ c x -~~P I ~C T P by the oligolabeling procedure. For the initial screening step, each of the labeled probes was hybridized against about 3 X 105 plaque-forming units of a cDNA library from Arabidopsis cultured cells constructed in A ZAP I1 (Stratagene) (Regad et al., 1993). Phage plaques were plated on membranes (Hybond-C-extra, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization, hybridization, and posthybridization washings were performed according to Sambrook et al. (1989).\n\nIn vivo excision of the A ZAP clones was performed as described in the manufacturer's (Stratagene) protocol. Nucleotide sequencing of the A cDNA clones were carried out on the corresponding double-stranded vector plasmids by the method of Sanger et al. (1977) using the Sequenase enzyme (version 2.0, United States Biochemical). A11 sequences were determined on both strands. To obtain the complete nucleotide sequence of clone SRGl (for senescence-related penes), a series of subclones containing nested deletions created by progressive digestion with exonuclease 111 was generated (Erase-A-Base kit, Promega). Homology searches against databases were performed using the BLAST computer program (Altschul et al., 1990) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments and determination of the percentages of homology were made using the PILEUP and GAP programs, respectively, of the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software package (Devereux et al., 1984).\n\nFor northern blot analyses, total RNA was denatured with glyoxal and DMSO and size-fractionated by electrophoresis on horizontal 1% (w/v) agarose gels. The RNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham) by vacuum-blotting, and hybridized to 32Plabeled DNA probes according to a previously described procedure (Regad et al., 1993). The XNS2 cDNA clone was kindly provided by Dr. Pamela J. Green (Michigan State University, East Lansing). The SAG2 and SAG4 cDNA clones were the generous gift of Dr. Anthony B. Bleecker (University of Wisconsin, Madison). The inserts of these clones and of the three SRG A clones were amplified by PCR with the universal primers M13 reverse and M13(-20). The PCR products were gel-purified and then labeled with [a-32P]dCTP using the oligolabeling procedure to generate probes for the different northern experiments. The EF-1a probe was a 32P-labeled BgIIlBglII fragment (404 bp), located in the 3' coding region of the Arabidopsis translation elongation factor 1a gene A2 (Axelos et al., 1989).\n\nArabidopsis cells were prepared for microscopic analysis according to a previously described procedure (Traas et al., 1992) with minor modifications. Cells were fixed by adding 0.5 mL of a solution containing 4% (w/v) formaldehyde (freshly made from paraformaldehyde) in PEM buffer (100 mM Pipes, pH 6.9, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM MgSO,) to 0.5 mL of culture. After 30 min, the cells were washed three times in PEM and finally resuspended in PEM containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 1 pg mL-' of the DNA-specific dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The cells were then mounted and viewed with epifluorescence optics (Axiophot microscope, Zeiss).\n\nWe used the differential display technique to compare the mRNA populations of growth-arrested cells with those of cells resuming active proliferation. For this purpose, RNA was isolated either from cells arrested for growth following a 12-d culture period (O-h sample) or from cells collected 16 and 40 h after transfer of the arrested culture into fresh culture medium (16-and 40-h samples). A selection of display profiles obtained by using three primer combinations is presented in Figure 1. The patterns and intensities of bands for the three RNA samples (O, 16, and 40 h) were similar, with the exception of a small number of differentially displayed bands. Severa1 of these bands appeared stronger in profiles corresponding to cells that had RNA from 12-d-old cells (0-h extracts) and cells collected 16 and 40 h after subculture in fresh medium were reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified with different primer sets: 5'TIIGC + oligo! (5'CGTCCTGCAA) (a); oligoX (5'A(C/T)(C/1\")TC(C/T)-TC(A/G)TA(C/ T)TT) + oligo2 (5'GTGACGTAGG) (b); and 5'T11GC + oligo3 (5'CTGCTGATGT) (c). The PCR products were resolved on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. For each display experiment mRNA was extracted from cells grown either in JPL (extract 1) or in Gamborg (extract 2) medium. The estimated size of each differentially amplified band is indicated, along with the name in parentheses of the corresponding A cDNA clone isolated by library screening.\n\nresumed growth (16 and 40 h) and, conversely, a number of strongly enhanced PCR bands were present in growtharrested cell samples (0 h). For four of these latter bands, indicated by arrows in Figure 1, a clear and reproducible amplification pattern was obtained from RNA extracts prepared independently from cell cultures maintained either in JPL (extract 1) or in Gamborg (extract 2) medium. These experiments suggest that nondividing cells express a set of mRNAs that are poorly represented or totally absent in cycling cells of young cultures.\n\nThe products of the PCR reaction were then isolated to obtain full-length cDNA clones corresponding to these differentially amplified molecules. Three of these were cloned into a plasmid vector and the unrelated contaminating cDNA molecules, a possible source of false-positives, were eliminated using a previously described method (Callard et al., 1994). Each insert sequence was then used as a hybridization probe to screen an Arabidopsis cultured cell cDNA library (Regad et al., 1993) constructed in a A phage vector. This led to the isolation of three groups of A clones, unrelated in sequence, and subsequently referred to as SRG1, SRG2, and SRG3 (see \"Discussion\" for nomenclature). In each case, the nucleotide sequences of the cloned PCR products were found to be identical to that of the cDNA insert of the corresponding A clones (data not shown), confirming that the cDNAs selected by library screening actually corresponded to the orig-inal differential display products and not to related, crosshybridizing sequences.\n\nRecombinant plasmids were rescued from each of the selected phages, and inserts were then used as northern hybridization probes to total RNA extracted from cells during the first 15 h after transfer of a 12-d-old cell inoculum into fresh medium (Fig. 2). The SRG1 and SRG2 cDNA probes hybridized to unique mRNAs of 1.5 and 2.1 kb, respectively. The SRG3 probe hybridized to a differentially expressed mRNA (SRG3a mRNA, 1.5-kb estimated size), and a second constitutively expressed transcript of smaller size (SRGSb, 0.8 kb). Since the SRG3 A clone contains an insert of 1.6 kb, which is comparable in size to the SRG3a mRNA, this mRNA corresponds to the differentially regulated gene of interest, referred to as SRG3a in the following experiments. As shown in Figure 2, the relative transcript levels of the SRG genes decreased upon transfer of cells into fresh medium. This decrease was extremely rapid for SRG2 and SRG3a and more gradual for SRG1. In contrast, the transcript levels of the Arabidopsis translation elongation factor la gene (EF-la, 1.8-kb mRNA), used as a hybridization control, increased significantly as cell growth resumed.\n\nA typical growth curve of the Arabidopsis cell culture is presented in Figure 3a. After transfer into the fresh culture medium, the cells grew exponentially without any apparent lag. After 6 d, the proliferative activity declined. Cells reached a maximal density after 12 d. Sue was the primary factor for growth limitation in our culture conditions (re- Plant Physiol. Vol. 112, 1996 1000 140 120 100 ra o> 80 |, Q.

As a control the northern blot was also hybridized to the Arabidopsis EF-1a probe. Amounts of extracted RNA per gram of fresh cells: 0, 0.36 mg; 3, 1.05 mg; 6, 0.71 mg; 9, 0.43 mg; 12, 0.27 mg; 15, 0.06 mg; 3', 0.91 mg; and 6', 0.64 mg.\n\nsuits not shown). As estimated by fluorescein diacetate staining, nearly all of the cells were still viable at this stage and were able to resume multiplication without a lag after transfer into fresh medium. Cell viability started to decline within 24 h following growth arrest, and was significantly lower 2 d later (after approximately 15 d of culture). During this final phase a gradual decrease in fresh cell weight was observed, indicative of partial cell lysis.\n\nWe also monitored the cell chlorophyll content of the culture (Fig. 3a) and observed a sharp decrease soon after transfer to fresh medium, resulting from an arrest of chlorophyll synthesis associated with a metabolic switch of the cells toward Sue assimilation. The chlorophyll concentration in the cells then increased progressively to reach a maximal value after 9 d, and then decreased rapidly during the final phase of the culture.\n\nThe expression of the SRG genes throughout all phases of cell culture was studied by northern analysis (Fig. 3b) using equivalent amounts of total RNA extracted from cells collected at the different time points on the growth curve shown in Figure 3a. In young cultures the three SRG genes showed a marked reduction in relative transcript level (3and 3'-d time points); however, the pattern of mRNA accumulation was different for each gene at later stages. SRG1 relative transcript levels gradually increased toward the end of exponential growth, and were maximal for 15-d-old cells. The SRG2 mRNA level was also maximal at this late stage, whereas this transcript could barely be detected in growing cells (3-9 d). In contrast, a maximal accumulation of SRG3a mRNA was observed between 6 and 9 d and subsequently decreased at the arrest of cell proliferation. The SRG3b transcript level was high and weakly modulated in growing cells. However, as for SRG3a, there was a progressive decline in mRNA level in late phases of the culture. The transcript level of EF-la, used as a control, was maximal in freshly subcultured cells (3 d) and remained approximately constant at other time points of the growth curve.\n\nThese findings indicate that major modifications to mRNA content occur at the stage at which culture conditions become limiting for cell growth. This phenomenon is associated with a decrease in cell RNA content (see legend of Fig. 3), which presumably correlates with a reduction in cell metabolic activity. A similar situation also exists in plants during tissue and organ senescence. To investigate a possible relationship at the molecular level between late phases of cell culture and whole plant senescence, we examined the expression patterns of several previously characterized senescence-associated Arabidopsis genes. The RNS2 gene, coding for an S-like RNase, is preferentially expressed in senescing tissues (Taylor et al., 1993), whereas the SAG2 and SAG4 genes are highly expressed during rosette-leaf senescence (Hensel et al., 1993;Grbic and Bleecker, 1995). We found that RNS2 exhibited an irregular expression pattern with a nearly constant transcript level throughout the culture cycle (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the two SAG gene expression profiles resembled that of the SRG1 gene, with a progressive increase in relative mRNA level reaching a maximal value after 12 d of culture, and a sharp decrease after transfer of the cells into fresh medium (3-and 3'-d time points).\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 4, SRG genes are poorly expressed in whole plant tissues, so low levels of SRG1 transcripts are detected in roots and flowers. The expression of RNS2, introduced as a control in this experiment, correlated well with that previously reported (Taylor et al., 1993), with a higher transcript level in flowers compared with leaves and stems, and a very weak signal in roots.\n\nTo determine whether there is preferential SRG mRNA accumulation during natural plant senescence, we evaluated transcript levels during the senescence of Arabidopsis rosette leaves. This process is associated with a loss of chlorophyll, thus providing a reliable indicator of the extent of senescence in these organs. Six independent pools of leaves corresponding to progressive stages of yellowing were prepared from flowering Arabidopsis plants, and SRG transcript levels were then determined by northern analysis. We found that the relative mRNA levels of all three genes increase significantly during senescence (Fig. 5a). The SRG1 transcript level is highest for leaves with extensive but not complete (75%, visual estimation) yellowing (pool 5), whereas for SRG2 and SRG3a mRNA accumulates to a maximal level in completely chlorotic leaves (pool 6). For the three previously characterized Arabidopsis genes RNS2, SAG2, and SAG4 a gradual increase in relative transcript levels can be correlated with the extent of chlorosis. EF-la transcript levels were approximately constant between different leaf pools, with a decrease in pool 6 corresponding to completely chlorotic leaves.

Expression of the SRC genes in senescing tissues of the whole plant, a, Northern analysis of SRC transcript levels in senescing rosette leaves.\n\nFifteen micrograms of total RNA extracted from six independent pools of leaves was northern-blotted and hybridized against the SRG, RNS2, SAC, and EF-la cDNA probes. Pool numbers correspond to: 1, young leaves; 2, fully expanded, green leaves; 3, 4, and 5, leaves with an increasing degree of yellowing (25, 50, and 75% estimated, respectively); and 6, chlorotic and withered leaves with apparent necrotic lesions. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA from a 12-d-old cell-suspension culture was loaded on the gel as a control. Amounts of extracted RNA per gram of leaf tissue were: 1, 0.27 mg; 2, 0.28 mg; 3, 0.18 mg; 4, 0.15 mg; 5, 0.10 mg; and 6, 0.07 mg. b, SRC2 gene expression in senescing petals. Total RNA (0.75 ju.g) extracted from floral buds, developing flowers collected at stage 13 (Smyth et al., 1990), and senescing, withered petals (stage 16) was subjected to northern blotting and hybridized to the SRG2 and RNS2 cDNA probes. As positive hybridization controls 0.75 and 5 ^.g of total RNA extracted from a 12-d-old cell culture were loaded on the gel.\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 11 2, 1996\n\nThe induction of peta1 senescence following fertilization is a second, well characterized, developmentally controlled senescence process. As shown in Figure 5b, a significant leve1 of SRG2 transcript was found in the RNA extract obtained from senescing petals. Transcripts corresponding to SRGl and SRG3a could not be detected (data not shown), probably due to the limiting amount of available tissue and, hence, the relatively small quantity of RNA (0.75 pg) used in the northern analysis.\n\nTo investigate the nature of the proteins encoded by SRG1, SRG2, and SRG3a we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the SRGl cDNA and partia1 5' and 3' sequences of the SRG2 and SXG3 cDNAs. Based on the estimated size of the SRGZ mRNA (1.5 kb), a A phage clone containing a possibly full-length cDNA insert 1396 nucleotides long was selected and sequenced. An open reading frame spanning 1074 nucleotides was identified within this cDNA, coding for a polypeptide of 358 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41,039 D and a pI of 5.2. Comparison of the putative SRGl protein sequence with sequences available in the databases revealed significant homology (around 55% similarity) with proteins of the Fe(II)/ ascorbate oxidase superfamily (McGarvey et al., 1992). Figure 6 shows the optimal alignment of the SRGl protein sequence with representative plant Fe(II)/ ascorbate oxidase sequences. Twelve amino acids, known to be highly conserved among a11 members of the Fe(II)/ ascorbate oxidase superfamily and localized within five conserved motifs (Britsch et al., 1993), were also present in the SRGl protein. Likewise, a putative Leu zipper region, previously identified in this superfamily (Britsch et al., 1993), was also found in SRGl (Fig. 6, underlined). A multiple alignment of the known protein sequences of the Fe(II)/ ascorbate oxidase superfamily and SRGl (results not shown) revealed a clustering of the proteins into distinct groups according to their ascribed functions; however, SRGl could not be clearly assigned to any particular group on t h s basis.\n\nBoth the 5' and 3' regions of the SRG2 cDNA were found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein highly homologous to P-glycosidases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (Henrissat, 1991). A homology search in databases using the BLASTX computer program (Altschul et al., 1990) showed that sequences producing high-scoring segment pairs were, in decreasing order: the P-glucosidases, the phospho-P-galactosidases, the thio-0-glucosidases, the phospho-P-glucosidases, and the P-galactosidases. An alignment of the NH,-and COOH-terminal regions of the putative SRG2 protein with comparable sequences of a representative population of P-glycosyl hydrolase members of the family is shown in Figure 7. One of the signature patterns of this family is present in the NH,-terminal region of SRG2 (Fig. 7a). The proteins sharing the highest degree of homology with the SRG2 sequence were plant P-glucosidases with 48 to 61% and 55 to 78% identity in the Nand C-terminal regions, respectively.\n\nFinally, the deduced amino acid sequence of SRG3a does not share any significant homology with sequences depos-\n\nSRGl 1 1 3 4 5 SRCl I 1 3 4 5 SRGI 1 2 3 4 5 11 TI1 SRGl 1 2 3 4 5 1v SRGI A B\n\n1 34% 56% 2 v E I L A T A * 32% 55% 3 31% 55% 4 31% 51% 5 '.?IL*. 30% 53% Figure 6 .

We focused on alterations commonly associated with \"programmed cell d e a t h in animal cells (Raff, 1992;Vaux, 1993), including nuclear shrinking, an early event resulting from chromatin compaction, and nDNA fragmentation into nucleosomes.\n\nThe nuclear morphologies of actively growing (6-d-old), arrested (12-d-old), or low-viability (15-d-old) Arabidopsis cells were studied using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining coupled with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8). Nuclei from 6-d-old cells were characterized by diffuse staining and a large nucleolus (Fig. 8, a and b). Irregularly stained granular nuclei, presumably resulting from local-Figure 8. Cytological analysis of nuclei from Arabidopsis cultured cells.

The size bar corresponds to 10 fim.\n\nized chromatin condensation, were present in 12-d-old cells (Fig. 8e), but were also occasionally observed in preparations from 6-d-old cells. Since localized compactions of chromatin in dense heterochromic regions (chromocenters) have previously been observed in the interphase nuclei of Arabidopsis (Maluszynska and Heslop-Harrison, 1991), the exact nature of these granular structures needs to be determined. On the other hand, most of the nuclei observed in 15-d-old cells appeared to be of small size, with a slightly increased fluorescence intensity and usually no visible nucleolus (Fig. 8, c and d). In certain 15-d-old cells, nuclei appeared fragmented into highly fluorescent \"chromatin granules\" (Fig. 8f). Taken overall, these initial cytological studies indicate that the arrest of proliferative activity and subsequent cell death in the Arabidopsis culture are associated with a significant alteration of nuclear morphology, which could result from general or localized condensation of chromatin.\n\nAnalysis of the DNA content of Arabidopsis cells in suspension cultures showed that DNA fragmentation into nucleosomes occurred 15 d after subculturing. As shown in Figure 9, a ladder of fragments calculated to be multiples of 160 bp was reproducibly detected in 15-d-old cells (lanes 4-6). This characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage was not detected in cells harvested at an earlier time when the cells were still viable (lane 3, 6-d-old cells). Furthermore, neither heat-killing of the cells nor lysis by repeated freezing/thawing treatments resulted in nucleosomal ladders in the corresponding DNA extracts (lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that the DNA ladder fragmentation is not simply a nonspecific result of cell lysis, but results from specific cell-mediated degradation events.\n\nWhen growth-arrested Arabidopsis cell-suspension cultures are subcultured into fresh medium, a qualitative change of the mRNA profile can be visualized using the differential display approach (Fig. 1). In addition to the appearance of a number of new mRNA species, we have also observed the disappearence of a small group of mRNAs present at high levels in the nondividing culture. In this article we report the identification and cloning of three cDNAs, SRGl, SRG2, and SRG3, which correspond to mRNAs of this latter group. It is interesting that the expression profiles of these genes differ throughout the culture growth cycle, as shown in Figure 3b. For SRGl and SRG2 relative transcript levels were maximal in growtharrested cells, whereas SRG3a mRNA levels peaked during the late growth phase. It is important to point out that, despite significant variations in total cell RNA contents throughout the culture cycle (Fig. 3b) and during organ senescence (Fig. 5a, see below), equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded for northern analysis. Such experiments can provide information only about the relative levels of Figure 9. Agarose gel analysis of DNA fragmentation in cultured Arabidopsis cells.

However, it is clear that de novo gene transcription must be a major contributing factor in those cases in which certain SRG mRNAs accumulate to a highly significant level in both senescing tissues and during late phases of the cell-growth cycle. Differences in the SRG mRNA profiles means either that these genes are not coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level, or that there are differences in the mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation (e.g. mRNA stability).\n\nNorthern analyses have shown that SRGZ, SRG2, and SRG3a mRNA accumulation is specifically associated with senescence-related processes in the intact Arabidopsis plant, with maximal relative transcript levels detected at late stages of leaf senescence. These results suggest that the SRG genes represent a new class of markers for plant senescence. The SAG2 and SAG4 genes, previously known to be specifically expressed during leaf senescence (Hensel et al., 1993;Grbic and Bleecker, 1995), were also found to be expressed in Arabidopsis cell cultures with kinetics of transcript accumulation similar to that observed for SRGl. It would appear that, in terms of gene expression, growth arrest and entry into the stationary phase in Arabidopsis cell-suspension cultures have certain features in common with the classically described senescence processes of plants. In this context, it has already been reported that cultured cells (such as those from pear fruit) can furnish useful model systems in the study of some aspects of plant senescence (e.g. Lelièvre et al., 1987). More recently, senescence processes have also been described in cultured rice cells, in which Suc starvation leads to an increase in specific a-amylases, correlating to an increase in vacuolar autophagy and accompanied by a degradation of cytoplasmic structures, including plastids (Chen et al., 1994).\n\nFollowing the transfer of viable, growth-arrested cells into fresh medium, dramatic reductions in mRNA levels were observed for SRGZ, SRG2, and SRG3a (Fig. 2). It is interesting that the same phenomenon was observed for the senescence-associated genes SAG2 and SAG4, transcript levels of which also decreased rapidly within 15 h of subculturing (data not shown). Hensel et al. (1993) hypothesized that the SAG2 and SAG4 genes might be subject to repression by specific metabolites. This could indeed be the case during subculturing, and suggests that the Arabidopsis cell-suspension culture might represent a useful biological system for metabolic repression studies.\n\nThe Arabidopsis S-like RNase-coding gene RNS2, which is preferentially expressed during both leaf and peta1 senescence (Taylor et al., 1993;Bariola et al., 1994), was also expressed in nondividing cell cultures. However, the relative transcript level of this gene was modulated in a complex fashion throughout the cell-growth cycle, with a significant level of mRNA present in cells even after transfer into fresh medium (Fig. 3). RNS2 also shows a fairly high basal level of expression in the absence of senescence induction in whole plant tissues, as shown by Bariola et al. (1994) and by the results presented in this article (see Figs. 4 and 5).\n\nThe SRG1-encoded protein is a new member of the Fe(II)/ ascorbate oxidase superfamily. This widely diver-gent family of structurally related proteins includes enzymes performing various functions in plants, such as the biosynthesis of flavonoid compounds, the production of ethylene, and the biosynthesis of alkaloids and hormones (for discussions, see Britsch et al., 1993;Tang et al., 1993;Xu et al., 1995). Unfortunately, the precise role of SRGl could not be deduced by amino acid sequence comparison.\n\nSequence analysis of the putative polypeptide encoded by the SRG2 gene provides strong evidence that this protein is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family l (Henrissat, 1991) and is most probably a P-glucosidase. This protein family is known to catalyze the hydrolysis of the p-Dglycosidic bond in a variety of natural p-glycoside conjugates, and their biological function is directly related to the nature of the cleaved conjugates (see Poulton, 1990;Brzobohaty et al., 1993;Leah et al., 1995). The precise function of the Arabidopsis SRG2 p-glucosidase could not be determined on the basis of the extent of sequence homology. As a rule, the glycosyl hydrolase activities are found associated with the ripening and senescence of plant tissues (e.g. Fisher and Bennett, 1991). A number of reports have described the expression of glycosyl hydrolases in nutrient-starved cell cultures, e.g. a-amylases from rice (Chen et al., 1994;Sheu et al., 1994), P-glucosidase from Brassica (Malboobi and Lefebvre, 1995), or N-acetyl-p-glucosaminidase from Silene (Lhernoud et al., 1994). It is well known that certain hydrolytic activities may be generated by the release of the corresponding enzymes from various cellular storage compartments. Given the SRG2 mRNA profile, it is clear that de novo transcription of this gene is necessary for generating enzyme activity, both in stationary-phase cultures and in senescing leaves.\n\nIn Arabidopsis T87-C3 cell cultures, the transition from growth arrest to loss of cell viability is relatively rapid. We show that this rapid death can be correlated with internucleosomal cleavage of nDNA, as well as with an apparent compaction of the chromatin (Figs. 8 and 9). In animals such events have been correlated with a process of active cell death, a suicide program leading to the elimination of unwanted cells (Raff, 1992;Vaux, 1993). Increasing data suggest that related cell-death programs may operate in plants. Indeed, DNA fragmentation in plant tracheids has recently been reported (Mittler and Lam, 1995). The hypersensitive response of plant tissues to a variety of pathogens also shares striking similarities with programmed cell death in animals (Mittler and Lam, 1996). The recent isolation of plant cDNA clones coding for homologs of the DAD-1 protein, which is able to rescue animal cells from programmed cell death (Apte et al., 1995;Sugimoto et al., 1995), also suggests that certain molecular mechanisms of animal apoptosis might be conserved in plants. The results presented in this paper raise the exciting possibility that Arabidopsis cell-suspension cultures may provide model systems for studying molecular features of both organ senescence and programmed cell death in plants.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1996 American Society of Plant Biologists.
