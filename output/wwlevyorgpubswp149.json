    "full_text": "Throughout the 199Os, America's two major political parties have been competing to show their interest in a more effective and efficient federal government.\n\nOne type of reform that has received considerable attention from members of both parties is biennial budgeting.\n\nA twoyear budget and appropriations cycle was endorsed by the Clinton Administration in its 1993 National Performance Review (NPR) report (Gore 1993). This reform was also favored by most members of the 103rd Looking to the states for lessons on federal biennial budgeting is not novel.\n\nThe approach has been employed by a number of budget analysts in articles and reports; the present article follows their lead (see, for example, Kirkman 1987;Meyers 1988;Irving 1993;Snell1993a).l\n\nAt the same time, this work offers its own contribution to the literature by providing not only an updated assessment but also an examination that draws on a larger pool studies.\n\nof evidence than most previous\n\nA budget period of one year has long been the norm in public finance.\n\nIn fact, researchers seeking to explain the budgetary principle of annuality have often stressed custom and tradition, not fiscal theory. Renee Stourm's landmark work, for example, emphasizes that \"this period corresponds with the customary measure of human estimates\" (Stourm 1917, 319; see also Sundelson 1935).\n\nThere is no doubt that the year has deep roots in the history of human calculation. But the practice of annual budgeting also has longstanding fiscal significance because it measures a cycle of fundamental importance to agriculturally-oriented communities (Buck 1934, 127-130).\n\nPlanning according to this natural cycle was crucial in pre-industrial societies and remains essential in the rural communities of today.\n\nIn England, adoption of annuality as a public budgeting principle can also be explained partly by the historical development of parliamentary authority. Since involvement in state finance has always been the source of their power, members of Parliament chose to take up the Crown's tax and spending proposals each year not only to permit frequent review of the monarch's fiscal activities but also to ensure that their grievances would be heard regularly.\n\nSeen from the perspective of a young Parliament engaged in an ongoing struggle with its king, one can easily appreciate the desire for a budget period of no longer than a year (Maitland 1920, 444;Ogg 1944;Punnett 1968, 280-282).\n\nThe federal government of the United States has always adhered to the norm of annuality with respect to the budget period.2 In fact, annual fiscal statements were issued even before the nation's budgetary system was formalized by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The original thirteen states also employed this principle. Nearly all the states convened their legislatures annually and practiced annual budgeting prior to 1840.\n\nIn the 184Os, however, states began to harness their legislatures by moving to biennial sessions and budgets. Historical research identifies six reasons for this development.\n\nOne is the rise of a belief that state assemblies needed less time to meet due to increased popular participation in public decision making.\n\nIn particular, citizens had increasingly been given the right to elect public officials who were previously appointed, and to alter state policies through constitutional conventions and referenda.3\n\nThe nineteenth-century trend toward biennial state action was also due to declining public confidence in the legislative branch. Like the federal government of our era, assemblies were often criticized for passing too many laws that conferred benefits upon special interests.\n\nOther arguments for the move to constrain state legislatures included California and New Jersey. Today a biennial budget and appropriations cycle is employed in 20 states --including 13 with annual legislative sessions (see Table 1).\n\nThe first federal bill to propose a biennial budget and Although a rash of missed budget deadlines helped generate interest in biennial budgeting during the 198Os, proponents of this reform often stress that budgeting will remain difficult. Budgetary decisions are political decisions --they cannot be made easier by procedural revision. The case for two-year budgeting does not involve the promise of bipartisan fiscal harmony and timely budget agreements (Meyers 1988, 26).5 The case centers instead on the belief that a biennial budget and appropriations cycle will streamline the budget process; make federal policies more effective; and promote economic stability.6\n\nStreamlining the Budget Process\n\nFederal budget cycles are complex and overlapping. Each cycle involves agency and White House preparation; budget submission; legislative authorization; development and approval of a budget resolution and appropriations; execution; and oversight and auditing. Since each budget cycle requires approximately 39 months, three or four cycles are likely to be in progress at any time (Lee and Johnson 1989, 45J.l Supporters of biennial federal budgeting argue that a two year budget and appropriations period would relieve participants of many routine and repetitive activities and allow them to use their time more efficiently. In particular, proponents maintain that biennial budgeting would make more time and resources available for service delivery, agency management, legislative oversight and long-range analysis. This view is bolstered by numerous studies which suggest that the present budget process burdens officials withmeaningless duplication; restricts time available for program reviews and other government activities; and discourages a focus on the long-term consequences of decisions (Congressional Budget Office 1977; Margeson and Saturn0 1987; Bowsher 1988; General Accounting Office 1989 and 1992). Opponents respond by maintaining that two-year budgeting will lead only to more work at nearly every stage in the budget cycle. They contend that there would be additional work in the preparation stage due to the extended fiscal period; that budget agreements would be more difficult to fashion because moving to a biennial process raises the stakes; and that unexpected but inevitable changes (due to a war, recession, or natural disaster) would lead to frequent fiscal adjustments during the budget period. Another concern is that budget work will expand to fill the time available. Since states provide natural \"laboratories of democracy,\" researchers and policymakers interested in federal policy have often examined state experiences in search of legislative and administrative insights. Indeed, framers of the national budget system established in 1921 were influenced heavily by state practices (Buck 1934, 41). The recent release of a new survey of biennial state budgeting, conducted by the state of New Jersey, makes the present an especially appropriate time to look once again toward the states. Reference to various studies of state budgeting will be made throughout the remainder of this article.\n\nBefore examining state-level experience for insight into the question of whether biennial budgeting will streamline the budget process, however, it is necessary to offer a comment on the suggestion that biennial budgets require more work than annual budgets. The flaw in that argument is that both the President and Congress are required to prepare multi-year budgets under the present system. Moreover, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) r second-year numbers are not only as precisely worked out as those for the fiscal year at hand but they also serve as ceilings for the next year's budget request (discussed in Rauch 1986(discussed in Rauch , 2319)).\n\nIn  CSG 1972, 20-21).\n\nIn contrast, states moving to from biennial to annual budgeting provided evidence of an increased budget workload --especially in executive agencies. Numerous respondents from these states indicated that annual budgeting allowed less time for consideration of substantive issues, provision of management services, and research into the improvement of agency structures and program operations (CSG 1972, 4-5).\n\nOfficials from Wisconsin, meanwhile, reported that although the addition of a thorough off-year review to their two-year budget system had some adverse effect on policy development and administration, budgeting in the second year was still only one-third as time consuming as full budget preparation (CSG 1972, 21-22).\n\nA One section is the product of field interviews with public officials and observers in five states that shifted from biennial to annual budgeting between the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe Texas A&M interviewers found that state agencies experienced increased budget-preparation workloads and costs, though estimates of these costs were not provided and their magnitude was said to vary from state to state. The researchers also reported that although annual budgeting caused legislators to devote greater time to budget issues, interviewees stressed that this additional time sometimes came at the expense of program reviews and was not necessarily used to produced better budgets.\n\nThe researchers illustrate this perspective by quoting one legislator who recommended a return to biennial budgeting so lawmakers would be better able l'to consider the budget deliberatively\" (Wiggins and Hamm The GAO's case-oriented study found that a principal benefit of biennial budgeting is that it allows executive and legislative officials more time for management, oversight and other activities beyond budget preparation and approval (Bowsher 1984; see also Myers 1982). Similar The final issue to be considered before turning to findings from the new budgeting survey produced by the state of New Jersey is the suggestion that federal budget work will expand to fill the time available. States do not stretch budget action over a two-year period.\n\nInstead, they employ a split-session model that confines such action to a single year (Kirkman 1987, 26-28).\n\nThe New Jersey Study with a two-year rather than a one-year budget period range from a few thousand dollars to the suggestion of two respondents that the former system cuts budget costs in half. Responses make it clear that cost estimates depend heavily on auxiliary assumptions such as whether budget agency staff would be augmented or merely reassigned to accommodate a shift from biennial to annual budgeting (NJOMB 1995, 14-15). This suggests that future research into the costs of biennial versus annual budgeting should be as precise as possible about the nature of the comparison being investigated.\n\nAnother question in the New Jersey study asks whether mid-term budget adjustments are as time consuming as preparation of a separate budget. Respondents are unanimous in their view that making adjustments during the two-year fiscal period requires less work than annual budgeting. Indeed, some note that the time saving is significant.\n\nMaine's budget office provides the most concrete estimate --it reports that adjustments require between one-third and one-half the time necessary for preparation of the initial budget.\n\nOnly one respondent (from Wisconsin) indicates that a revision can sometimes require an effort approaching that of annual budgeting (NJOMB 1995, 8-g).'\n\nThe biennial-budgeting survey conducted by the NJOMB combines with previous state studies to support the argument that biennial budgeting --at least in its split-sessions form --streamlines the budget process.\n\nThis experience suggests that a two-year federal budget period (with split sessions) would eliminate much procedural repetition and enable According to Art, this experiment was a \"half successl' (Art 1989, 208).\n\nSince Congress refused to authorize and appropriate funds for a two-year period, agency stability was not enhanced. Nevertheless, Pentagon comptrollers and service programmers were unanimous in the belief that biennial budget preparation was beneficial.\n\nArt reports that the two-year schedule reduced problems associated with the overlapping of budget cycles and enabled the introduction of analyses, evaluations and plans that were widely viewed as having improved agency operations.\n\nHe writes: biennial budgeting allowed DOD officials time \"to do things they should have been doing but never could do because of the ratrace of annual budgeting\" (Art 1989, 206).\n\nArt indicates that although specifying dollar amounts is difficult, gains associated with better evaluation and planning are not trivial.\n\nBiennial budgeting's procurement savings, however, are much more easily calculated --and Art suggests that per-unit savings here could be 50 percent or more for some weapons. In his view, better quality decisions and more efficient resource utilization are the ultimate benefits of biennial budgeting (Art 1989, 208-213).\n\nAmong studies of state experience, New Jersey's survey seeks to most directly explore the question of whether biennial budgeting makes policies more effective.\n\nIn particular, it asks if biennial budgeting improves program performance and planning. Eight budget officers respond in the affirmative, while two indicate only that two-year budgeting \"should\" engender such improvements (one wrote \"we have no way of proving this assumption\"). The remaining response is as follows: \" I have no data on its impact on planning and performance\" (NJOMB 1995, 15-16).\n\nState studies conducted prior to the NJOMB inquiry shed little light on the matter of whether budgeting for two years helps make policies more effective. Some of these studies explored the relationship between biennial budgets and long-term planning, but their findings were largely inconclusive.\n\nAlthough the 1987 GAO study provides some evidence that biennial budgeting is associated with greater fiscal planning, other studies do not establish that a two-year budget system has any impact on the amount research and analysis (Kirkman 1987, 17-25 section III, 15-16;and CSG 1972, g-10). In recent years, many economic-policy analysts have emphasized the need for the nation's lawmakers to achieve not only long-term deficit reduction but also a fiscal orientation that places greater emphasis on public investment (see, for example, GAO 1992;and Sichel 1995).\n\nBiennial budgeting can contribute to the goal of reducing the federal budget deficit by providing legislators with an opportunity not only to give closer scrutiny to entitlements and other forms of \"mandatory\" federal spending but also to make a wide range of policies more effective-l2 Two-year budgeting also enables Congress to change fiscal priorities gradually --multi-year plans can be more easily set and met when budgets are enacted biennially.\n\nSupporters of biennial federal budgeting suggest that two-year budgets can promote stability at not only the macroeconomic level but also at the level of specific individuals, agencies and corporations.\n\nOpponents respond that stability comes only at the expense of two important features of the present system: flexibility and congressional control (over the budget and the executive branch).\n\nThe fact that economic priorities and policies may be maintained for two years at a time leads some to argue that a biennial system will be insufficiently responsive to both changing circumstances and the public interest.\n\nAccording to the GAO's 1984 biennial-budgeting report, officials in states with two-year budgeting expressed the belief that the system's benefits outweighed its problems. At the same time, they identified the following as disadvantages:\n\n--the increased difficulty in estimating accurately revenues and expenditures in the second year and budgeting for l'uncontrollablell items, such as changes in expenditures for entitlement programs; and\n\n-_ the legislature's perceived loss of control over the executive and state agencies, since there are fewer opportunities to make program and budget decisions (Bowsher 1984, 2-3).\n\nThis provides some evidence supporting the view that biennial budgeting requires some loss of both flexibility and legislative control.\n\nThe NJOMB study reinforces the view that forecasting accuracy and fiscal flexibility are greater under annual budgeting (there is no discussion of legislative control).13 But it also indicates --as discussed earlier --that biennial budgets are less time consuming and less costly to prepare, even after accounting for mid-term corrections.\n\nThe principal budget complications identified by states are the following: economic fluctuations; unstable federal funding; and unanticipated Medicaid expenses (NJOMB 1995, 2-12).\n\nThe New Jersey survey also asks whether biennial budgeting provides greater certainty for managers of public programs, schools, and local units of government that depend on state funding.\n\nAll respondents indicate that two-year budgets increase stability and certainty, though some note that major changes in the economic and/or political climate can nullify the potential gains of a biennial system (NJOMB 1995, 15-16). These findings confirm a view expressed by Snell in his 1994 NCSL report (Snell 1994, 6-7).14\n\nState experience suggests that biennial federal budgeting can contribute to public agency stability --stability that enables managers to focus greater attention on matters including service delivery and the long-term implications of program operations. It also appears that state and local governments would be among the chief beneficiaries of the stability provided by two-year federal budgeting, for much of their budget uncertainty is traceable to matters that involve (or can be influenced by) federal action.\n\nCorporations might also benefit from this form of federal budgeting. In particular, biennial federal budgets might allow private firms to extend their own planning horizons somewhat _ _ a step identified by numerous research studies as necessary for continued improvements in U.S. competitiveness.15\n\nState studies provide no guidance on the matter of whether biennial federal budgeting will promote macroeconomic stability.16 But two-year budgets can be compatible with both macro-level economic stability and fiscal discipline if policymakers place heavy reliance on automatic stabilizers and establish a budgetary structure that generates deficits only during recessions. While political economists have long been concerned about the destabilizing effects of unanticipated monetary policy fluctuations, we should not ignore the similarly disruptive impact of frequent and unpredictable fiscal policy changes.17\n\nThe approach to macroeconomic stabilization that has just been described would require Congress to accept increased uncertainty about the specific dollar amount of a given year's budget deficit. While the nation's tax and expenditure programs can be structured so that the deficit's size falls within a rather narrow range, biennial budgeting might make it more difficult to hit a particular target figure during a period of economic instability. But this is not a new problem; legislators have always had to decide between balancing the overall economy and balancing the budget with precision. Macroeconomic stabilization does not mean that Congress has given up V'control,\" merely that it has chosen to control the economy with greater precision than the annual budget deficit.l'\n\nAn examination of state experience with biennial budgeting permits three additional comments on congressional control.\n\nOne is that Congress's control over the budget may be enhanced by biennial budgeting because the process gives legislators an increased opportunity to review existing policies and expenditures. Another is that Congress can retain some control over apportionment of funds across the biennium by enacting two one-year appropriations (rather than a consolidated two-year budget) at the start of each budget period. According to Snell, 17 of the 20 biennial-budgeting states allocate appropriations in this manner (Snell 1994, 3).19 A third observation is that although some suggest biennial budgeting might cause Congress write even more l'micro-management\" provisions into law, evidence from the Texas A&M study contradicts that suggestion (Meyers 1988, 29;Wiggins and Hamm 1984, section III, 27).\n\nIn short, executive-legislative relations should not be altered significantly by biennial federal budgeting.\n\n(For a similar view, see Mann (1993).)\n\nWhile it is questionable that biennial budgets will reduce congressional control, one cannot deny that some tradeoff exists between the flexibility of annual budgeting and the stability --and increased opportunity for policy analysis and planning --of two-year budgeting.\n\nNevertheless, there are a number of reasons for choosing the more stable budget process over the more flexible annual system. First, budgetary stability is beneficial.\n\nAs Alice Rivlin has written:\n\nToo frequent changes can be counterproductive. Transfer payments need to be predictable so that peoples' lives are not indicate that the current federal budgeting system is one that permits too much flexibility and suffers from too little stability, continuity and policy planning (Rivlin 1981 and1984;GAO 1989 and1992).20 AS U.S.\n\nComptroller General Charles Bowsher stated during one congressional hearing, flexibility in the current process comes \"at a high price.\" In particular, his testimony identified a number of features that keep the process flexible and noted that such arrangements \"invite revisitings of the issues and make the budget process vulnerable to extraneous and time-consuming delays.\" Bowsher concluded that this flexibility \"gives members of Congress the feeling that the budget process is out of control and never-ending,\" and he encouraged lawmakers to experiment with two-year budgets (Bowsher 1988).\n\nThis article demonstrates that fiscal theory does not identify one budget period as universally appropriate. Annual budgeting is not inherently llsuperiortl to multi-year budgeting.\n\nAn appropriate budget period can be identified only after one weighs the advantages and disadvantages of alternate arrangements.\n\nThe evidence reviewed in this article suggests that biennial budgeting can indeed offer significant benefits if adopted at the    and Saturn0 (1987, 5);Nunn (1992, 5);and Domenici (1992, 2).\n\n11. According to Wiggins and Hamm, lobbyists surveyed on the prospect of moving Texas to an annual budgeting system reported that such budgeting would provide them with \"a greater chance to influence the budget\" (Wiggins and Hamm 1984, section V, 5).\n\n12. While a further discussion of the relationship between biennial budgeting and deficit reduction will be presented in the next section, two points are warranted at present. One is that the present-day goal of deficit reduction is not necessarily incompatible with a budgetary structure that generates deficits during recessions. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), federal deficits have for over two decades been consistently greater than what countercyclical macroeconomic policy would have required (CBO 1994, 4 and 87). The other point is that although some have suggested agencies would pad their budgets under a biennial-budget system (due to the reduced reliability of two-year projections), state experiences reviewed by the Texas A&M study do not support this contention (Wiggins and Hamm 1984, section III, 14 and section V, 6). (This last point is also supported by the discussion of state spending found in Snell (1994, 8)).\n\n13.\n\nIt should be noted that one respondent to the New Jersey survey indicated biennial revenue forecasts are often more accurate than annual forecasts because short-term fluctuations tend to even themselves out over a period of two years (NJOMB 1995, 10). This possibility was also mentioned in the GAO's 1984 study of biennial state budgeting (Bowsher 1984, 5).\n\nSnell adds that even annual budgeting is rather predictable in stable times, because programs are seldom susceptible to sweeping changes (Snell 1994, 7). But the existence of such predictability is not necessarily an argument against biennial budgeting --indeed, one could argue instead that it provides additional support for such budgeting.\n\n15. For discussions of short-term time horizons in America, see Michael\n\nDertouzos and the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity (1989);\n\nCompetitiveness Policy Council (1992); and Michael Porter (1992).\n\n16. Although annual budgeting is used by nearly all our international competitors, other industrial democracies have parliamentary political systems and/or planning mechanisms that give fiscal policy greater stability than it has in the United States. For a discussion of multiyear direction setting in Japan, for example, see Ronald Dore (1986,(132)(133)(134). 17. For an early discussion of the need for stability in fiscal policy, see Lewis H. Kimmel (1959, 279-283).\n\n18.\n\nFor more on the choice between balancing the economy and the deficit, see Mongia (1995) and Meyers (1988, 28-30).\n\n19. Under a system with two sets of one-year appropriations, Congress might choose to index certain second-year outlays to inflation.\n\n20. According to the GAO, America's federal budget process \"needs to adopt a longer-term planning horizon linking fiscal policy with broader goals for the performance of the economyI' (GAO 1992, 16).\n\n21. In a letter to the author dated August 2, 1993, Rivlin reiterated her support for biennial budgeting.\n\n22. For a fuller discussion of the timing of biennial budgeting (and implications for political stability), see Bowsher (1984, 6) and Irving (1993,6).\n\nAlso, note that extension of the budget period is constrained by the length of the election cycle in the House Of Representatives.\n\nFor more comprehensive discussions of improving financial management within the federal government, see Bowsher (1984, 8-9); Gore (1993); NPR (1993); and Symposium on NPR recommendations (1995,.\n\n24.
