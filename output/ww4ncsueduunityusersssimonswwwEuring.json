    "abstract": "Avian point counts vary over space and time due to actual differences in abundance, differences in detection probabilities among counts, and differences associated with measurement and misclassification errors. However, despite the substantial time, effort, and money expended counting birds in ecological research and monitoring, the validity of common survey methods remains largely untested, and there is still considerable disagreement over the importance of estimating detection probabilities associated with individual counts. Most practitioners assume that current methods for estimating detection probability are accurate, and that observer training obviates the need to account for measurement and misclassification errors in point count data. Our approach combines empirical data from field studies with field experiments using a system for simulating avian census conditions when most birds are identified by sound. Our objectives are to: identify the factors that influence detection probability on auditory point counts, quantify the bias and precision of current sampling methods, and find new applications of sampling theory and methodologies that produce practical improvements in the quality of bird census data.\nWe have found that factors affecting detection probabilities on auditory counts, such as ambient noise, can cause substantial biases in count data. Distance sampling data are subject to substantial measurement error due to the difficulty of estimating the distance to a sound source when visual cues are lacking. Misclassification errors are also inherent in time of detection methods due to the difficulty of accurately identifying and localizing sounds during a count. Factors affecting detection probability, measurement errors, and misclassification errors are important but often ignored components of the uncertainty associated with point-count-based abundance estimates.",
    "full_text": "The most common method of estimating avian abundance is the point count (Ralph et al. 1995) where a single observer records all birds seen or heard at a point during a prescribed interval (usually 3-10 min) (Fig. 1). Surveys of breeding birds rely heavily on auditory detections which can comprise 70% of observations in suburban landscapes (Sauer et al. 1994), 81% in tropical forests (Scott et al. 1981), and up to 97% of observations in closed-canopy deciduous forest (DeJong and Emlen 1985;Brewster 2007).\n\nAvian abundance estimates can vary over space and time due to actual differences in abundance, differences in detection probabilities among counts, and differences associated with measurement and misclassification errors (Nichols et al. 2008;Nichols et al. 2000;Farnsworth et al. 2002;Pollock et al. 2002;Rosenstock et al. 2002;Thompson 2002).\n\nA general conceptual model (Marsh and Sinclair 1989;Pollock et al. 2004Pollock et al. , 2006) for auditory count-based abundance estimates can be represented as:\n\nFig. 1 Common point count protocols. (a) A single observer standing at the center of a circular plot maps the location and estimated distance to all birds seen or heard during a prescribed time interval, usually 3-10 min. Time of detection information can be incorporated by color-coding or annotating observations to indicate the time interval of initial and subsequent detections. (b) Multiple observer methods employ two or more observers who collect data simultaneously. Observers can assume either dependent (Nichols et al. 2000) or independent (Alldredge et al. 2006) roles where:\n\nN = the population estimate C = the count statistic p area = the fraction of the area sampled pa = the probability that a bird is available to be counted pda = the probability that a bird is detected given that it is available.\n\nMany factors influence the probability of detecting birds during auditory point counts. These factors include both \"measurement error\" factors associated with observer skill and ability, and \"signal to noise ratio\" factors that influence how much information about bird diversity and abundance is available to observers. Measurement error factors relate to observer skill in identifying and localizing individual birds (Kepler and Scott 1981), and hearing ability (Emlen andDejong 1981, 1992;Sauer et al. 1994;Kendall et al. 1996;Downes 2004). Signal to noise ratio factors include the spectral qualities of songs (Schieck 1997), song volume, singing rate (Best 1981;Ralph 1981;Skirvin 1981), time of day (Sheilds 1977;Robbins 1981a;Skirvin 1981), the orientation of singing birds (toward or away from observers), (Alldredge et al. 2007c) presence of an observer (McShea and Rappole 1997), the number of species and number of individuals singing during a count (Simons et al. 2007), pairing status (Krebs et al. 1980;Johnson 1983;Cuthill and Hindmarsh 1985;Gibbs and Wenny 1993), stage of nesting cycle (Wilson and Bart 1985), vegetation structure (Diehl 1981;McShea and Rappole 1997;Simons et al. 2006;Pacifici et al. in press), topography, weather (Mayfield 1981;Robbins 1981b), temperature, humidity, and ambient noise (Simons et al. 2007). Systematic variation in any of these factors will impart a systematic bias in count data.\n\nAt least five methods of estimating detection probabilities on avian point counts are currently available (Nichols et al. 2008): distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001), multiple-observer methods (Nichols et al. 2000;Alldredge et al. 2007a), time-of-detection methods (Farnsworth et al. 2002;Alldredge et al. 2007b), double sampling (Bart and Earnst 2002) and repeated count methods (Royle and Nichols 2003;Kery et al. 2005). Applications of combined methods are also possible (Kissling and Garton 2006;Alldredge et al. 2007a, b). Different methods estimate different components of the detection process. For example, distance sampling and multiple observer approaches assume that all birds on a given sample plot are available (sing during the count interval) and they estimate the probability of detection given availability. Time of detection methods provide estimates of the product of availability and detection given availability (Alldredge et al. 2007a) but they cannot separate the two components. Repeated count methods (Royle and Nichols 2003;Nichols et al. this volume) estimate the product of availability, detection given availability, and a third component of the detection process, the probability that an individual is present in the sample area. A brief example will illustrate how correcting avian point count data for variations in detection probability among species and habitats can dramatically alter abundance estimates. Figure 2 summarizes count data for 18 species of forest songbirds from 247 paired point count locations in primary and secondary southern Appalachian forests (Simons et al. 2006). Of interest is the similarity of unadjusted counts (Fig. 2a) for two very dissimilar species, the Scarlet Tanager (SCTA, Piranga olivacea) and the Golden-crowned Kinglet (GCKI, Regulus satrapa). The Scarlet Tanager is a brightly-colored, very active and vocal species that flies constantly about the forest canopy giving a loud, high-energy call. The Golden-crowned Kinglet is a small, drab, and generally inconspicuous species that forages along branches and gives a high, thin, low-energy call. The unadjusted counts for these two species suggest that their abundance is similar in primary and secondary forests. However when we examine the effective detection radii (Buckland et al. 2001) of the two species (Fig. 2b) and use this information to convert the raw counts into density estimates (Fig. 2c) dramatic differences in abundance become apparent. Accounting for differences in detection probability related to differences in the conspicuousness of theses two species results in a nearly four-fold difference in our abundance estimate. Similarly, differences in abundance between primary and secondary forest habitats become apparent once counts are adjusted for differences in detection probability between habitats. Failure to account for such differences detection probabilities among species and habitats weakens inferences from comparative studies of avian abundance (Yoccoz et al. 2001;Pollock et al. 2002;Williams et al. 2002).\n\nNevertheless, there is still considerable disagreement over the importance of estimating detection probabilities associated with individual counts (Rosenstock et al. 2002). Although common survey methods are largely unvalidated, most practitioners assume that current methods for estimating detection probability are accurate, and that observer training obviates the need to account for measurement and misclassification errors in point count data. Given the substantial time, effort, and money expended conducting avian point counts to address ecological research and monitoring objectives (Bart 2005;Simons et al. 2007), validating current avian sampling methods has enormous practical importance. In this paper we first review factors that influence detection probabilities on auditory counts, and we then summarize key findings of recent field experiments aimed at understanding the factors affecting detection probabilities, and the sources and magnitude of measurement and misclassification errors inherent in several common sampling methods.\n\nOur approach uses empirical data from field studies of southern Appalachian songbirds (Shriner 2001;Lichstein et al. 2002;Brewster 2007) to inform the development of new avian sampling methods (Farnsworth et al. 2002;Alldredge et al. 2007a), and to design field experiments (Simons et al. 2007) that assess the factors affecting detection probabilities on auditory counts (Alldredge et al. 2007b; Pacifici et al. in press), and the precision and accuracy of auditory avian point count methods. (Alldredge et al. 2007c, d; Alldredge et al. in press).\n\nField experiments are conducted using a system for simulating avian census conditions when most birds are identified by sound (Fig. 3). The system uses a laptop computer to control up to 50 amplified MP3 players placed at known locations up to 200 m around a survey point (see Simons et al. (2007) for details). To date we have simulated over 5,000 unlimited radius point counts with 50 observers (Fig. 4). The system can realistically simulate a known population of songbirds under a range of factors that affect detection probabilities. Validation experiments evaluate traditional methods for estimating detection probabilities, such as distance sampling, and new approaches that incorporate information from multiple observers, the time sequence of observations, and combined methods.  Experiments were replicated under four ambient noise conditions: (a) quiet (mean ambient noise 40.6 dB, S.D. 4.47 dB), (b) breezy (10-20 km/h gusty winds, 55.4 dB, S.D. 3.87 dB), (c) quiet conditions with three background birds Winter Wren (WIWR, Troglodytes troglodytes), Yellow-throated Warbler (YTWA, Dendroica dominica), and Ovenbird (OVEN, Seiurus aurocapillus) singing 40 m behind or to either side of the observers, and (d) quiet conditions with white noise added (10 dB above ambient). White noise (uniform power, spectral frequency = 1.0) was played from a speaker facing the observers at a distance of 10 m. Results illustrate how detection distances decline and identification errors increase with increasing levels of ambient noise. Overall, the proportion of birds heard by observers decreased by 28 ± 4.7% under breezy conditions, 41 ± 5.2% by the presence of additional background birds, and 42 ± 3.4% by the addition of 10 dB of white noise.\n\nTemporal trends in environmental factors such as ambient noise can impart trends in count data unrelated to the true abundance of birds. To provide some context for our ambient noise experiment we asked observers to record ambient noise levels on 21 Breeding Bird Survey (Sauer et al. 2005) routes across North Carolina in 2006. Note the proportion of North Carolina BBS counts in which ambient noise levels exceed 40 dB (Fig. 6). Ambient noise experiments (Fig. 5) indicate that an increase in ambient noise from 40 to 50 dB produces a 42% average reduction in the counts of six common species. Thus, if ambient noise levels along these North Carolina routes increased by 10 dB over the past 20 years, we would expect BBS counts of species detected by ear to decline over that interval by about 40%, even if populations were stable. Because BBS counts are not adjusted for differences in detection probability, in this example there is no way of knowing if declines represent actual population declines or simply declines in detection probability due to increasing ambient noise. 21 20 10 26 23 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 5/2 -5/7 5/16 -5/21 5/31 -6/5 6/13 -6/18 Sampling period Songs/min 6/28 -7/1 Fig. 7 Declining singing rates of Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) over the breeding season in North Carolina. Sample sizes (individual birds sampled for a minimum of 30 min) and standard errors indicated for each sample period (Brewster 2007) Trends in other factors affecting detection probabilities, such as observers or habitat conditions (Sauer et al. 1994;Norvell et al. 2003), can impart similar biases. For example, a recent analysis indicated that 76% of observers conducting Canadian Breeding Bird Survey routes are over 45 years old (Downes 2004;Simons et al. 2007). Forty-five percent of observers cited \"hearing loss\" as their primary reason for retiring from the survey. As with ambient noise, trends in age-related hearing loss can impart trends in count data that are unrelated to true abundance.\n\nSinging rates of most breeding songbirds decline steadily during the breeding season. Brewster (2007) found that singing rates of southern Appalachian Blackthroated Blue Warblers declined by 50% during the first month of the breeding season (Fig. 7). Temporal trends in factors such as average singing rates, that influence availability during a count, can also impart trends in count data unrelated to the true abundance. For example, there is increasing evidence that birds are breeding earlier now than in the past, presumably due to global warming (Butler 2003). Climatic trends that impart trends in the average singing rates of birds will bias abundance estimates over time unless analyses account for the temporal trends in detection probabilities.\n\nWe assessed several factors thought to influence overall detection probabilities (p a p da ) on 40 experimental 3-min point counts comprised of 10 birds per count and five primary species (Black-and-white Warbler (BAWW), Mniotilta varia), Black-throated Blue Warbler, Black-throated Green Warbler (BTNW, Dendroica virens), Hooded Warbler (HOWA, Wilsonia citrina), and Ovenbird over a range of 15 distances (34-143 m). Songs were played at low (two songs per count) and high (13-21 songs per count) singing rates (Alldredge et al. 2007b). Detection probabilities at 100 m ranged from 0.60 (Black-and-white Warbler) to 0.83 (Hooded Warbler) at the high singing rate and 0.41 (Black-and-white Warbler) to 0.67 (Hooded Warbler) at the low singing rate (Fig. 8). Logistic regression Fig. 8 Logistic regression models for a single observer illustrating the relationship between detection probability and distance for counts of five species (Black-and-white Warbler (BAWW, Mniotilta varia), Black-throated Blue Warbler (BTBW, Dendroica caerulescens), Black-throated Green Warbler (BTNW, Dendroica virens), Hooded Warbler (HOWA, Wilsonia citrina), and Ovenbird (OVEN, Seiurus aurocapillus) singing at high and low singing rates (Alldredge et al. 2007b). Note the consistent effect of singing rate on detection probability analyses indicated that species, singing rate, distance, and observer were all significant factors affecting detection probabilities. Simulations of expected counts based on the best logistic model (Table 1), indicated that observers detected between 19% (190/1000 birds for the worst observer, lowest singing rate, and least detectable species) and 65% (653/1000 birds for the best observer, highest singing rate, and most detectable species) of the true population.\n\nDetection distance is one of the most important and common auxiliary variables measured during point count surveys of avian abundance. The distance to individual birds is used to determine the effective area sampled, to determine if birds are within a fixed radius plot, and to model the detection process. In densely vegetated habitats, visual detections of birds are rare, and most estimates of detection distance are based solely on auditory cues. Distance sampling theory assumes that detection distances are measured accurately, but empirical validation of this assumption for auditory detections is lacking. We simulated avian point counts in a forested habitat to determine the error structure of distance estimates based on auditory detections (Alldredge et al. 2007c). Experiments were conducted with six experienced observers both before and after distance estimation training. Experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of the height and orientation (toward or away from observers) of the song source on distance estimation error. Distance estimation errors for all experiments were substantial, although training did reduce errors and bias in distance estimates. Distance estimates for all observers increased for all species played between 23 and 65 m. Distance estimates did not increase for songs played at distances between 65 and 86 m, indicating observers were not able to differentiate distances among songs played within this range. The height from which songs were played had no effect on distance estimation errors. The orientation of the song source did have a large effect on distance estimation errors; observers generally doubled their estimates for songs played away from them compared to songs played directly toward them (Fig. 9).\n\nComparing simultaneous observations by two or more observers provides another measure of point count detection probabilities (Alldredge et al. 2006). The method requires that observers accurately map bird locations and match birds detected by all observers. We evaluated the accuracy and sources of measurement and classification error in double-observer counts by conducting 60 experimental 3-min point counts with six experienced observers (Alldredge et al. in press). Thirty five players were uniformly distributed with respect to area around a single point. All players were set 1m above ground at radial distances between 0 and 120m. Songs for all species were played at a sound intensity of approximately 90 dB at a distance of 1m. Each count had exactly 12 birds of up to eight species. Six primary species; Scarlet Tanager (SCTA, Piranga olivacea), Acadian Flycatcher (ACFL, Empidonax  In contrast, counts were inflated by an average of 8% (S.E. 1.6%) due a combination of double-counting and misidentification (imagined birds) errors.\n\nWe evaluated the time of detection method (Farnsworth et al. 2002;Alldredge et al. 2007a) by conducting 60, 8-min point counts with four experienced observers (Alldredge et al. 2007d). Counts were divided into four, 2-min intervals, and observers recorded birds using multi-colored pens to distinguish time intervals. Detections of birds recorded in a previous interval were noted by underlining the initial notation in the color of the current time interval. Thirty five players were uniformly distributed with respect to area around a single point. All players were set 1m above ground at radial distances between 0 and 1m. Songs for all species were played at a sound intensity of approximately 90 dB at a distance of 1m. Eighteen birds of 12 species were simulated on each point. Analyses were focused on eight species; ACFL, BAWW, BTBW, BTNW, HOWA, OVEN, SCTA, and YTWA. Songs of 100 total individual birds of each of these eight species were played on the 60 counts. The total simulated population size was 800 birds because not all birds in the simulated population were available on some counts. Availability of ACFL, BAWW, BTNW, SCTA, and YTWA was simulated under a Markovian process with availability during the count interval varying between 0.60 and 1.0, and singing rates varying from 2 to 8 songs per minute. Singing rates and availability for BTBW and OVEN were based on empirical field data (Brewster 2007). Double counting, counting a single bird as more than one bird, was a significant source of error among the four experienced observers. Double counting rates ranged from 0.9 to 3.4% (S.E. 0.6%) of total observations among observers. Double counting occurred in a variety of forms. In most cases single birds were recorded as two birds throughout the count interval. This created two or more capture histories that clearly indicated a single individual tracked as two birds throughout the count. Occasionally observers mapped a bird in one location at the beginning of the count, then mapped the same bird in a new location and continued to track it at the new location for the remainder of the count. These cases produced two or more capture histories of the form xx00 for the original bird and 00xx for the double count, where x could be a either a one or a zero.\n\nOverall 2.0-4.1% (S.E. 0.43%) of observations were recorded in the wrong time interval among the four observers. This can occur when two or more individuals of the same species sing during a count, and observers attribute a song to the wrong individual. Finally, as we found in the multiple-observer experiment, misidentification errors were rare with experienced observers. Misidentification errors ranged from 0.1 to 0.6% (S.E. 0.09%) of total observations among the four experienced observers.\n\nMany known and unknown factors influence detection probabilities on auditory point counts. These include factors such as ambient noise, habitat structure, and the singing rates of individual birds that can impart trends in abundance estimates unrelated to true abundance. Fortunately, multiple methods of estimating detection probabilities are now available, and we believe direct estimates of detection probability should accompany all analyses of avian point count data.\n\nUnfortunately, methods that require the localization of auditory detections are subject to large measurement and misclassification errors. Our experiments illustrate the source and magnitude of those errors, although we believe errors on actual point counts are probably larger than our results suggest, because our simulations involved a relatively small number of species, our observers were highly experienced, and many sources of variability were carefully controlled in our experiments.\n\nAs the example for the Golden-crowned Kinglet and Scarlet Tanager in the introduction illustrates, distance sampling can reduce sampling bias for species with large differences in behavior, plumage, and song characteristics. Nevertheless we found that measurement error on auditory point counts is substantial, presumably because the complexities of sound attenuation and reverberation in natural environments make the localization of auditory cues very difficult. We recommend that practitioners distinguish between visual and auditory detections in their analyses of point count data, and recognize the limitations of distance sampling methods on avian point counts when detections are auditory. If distance sampling based solely on auditory detections is unavoidable, analyses should incorporate estimates of measurement error.\n\nClassification and matching errors are important and generally ignored components of overall error rates on multiple-observer and time of detection point counts. Errors result primarily due to the difficulty of localizing auditory cues and accurately mapping bird locations (Buckland 2006). We would expect substantially larger errors on actual point counts that employ these methods due to the movement of birds during the count interval.\n\nThese findings imply that the uncertainty surrounding estimates of avian diversity and abundance based on distance, double-observer, and time of detection auditory sampling methods is much higher than is currently assumed by practitioners. Therefore conclusions based on those estimates are, in most cases, weaker than those currently reported in studies based on auditory detections. Approaches to account for this uncertainty in abundance models are clearly needed if abundance estimates are to withstand critical scrutiny.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible that modern avian auditory sampling methods, that require observers to simultaneously track the location and singing rates of multiple individuals and multiple species, often exceed the ability of human observers. Simplified protocols, such as single species surveys, or occupancy approaches based on presence/absence data (Royle and Nichols 2003) that reduce the demands on human observers, may ultimately yield better results."
