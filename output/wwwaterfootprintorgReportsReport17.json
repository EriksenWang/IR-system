    "abstract": "Many nations save domestic water resources by importing water-intensive products and exporting commodities that are less water intensive. National water saving through the import of a product can imply saving water at a global level if the flow is from sites with high to sites with low water productivity. The report analyses the consequences of international virtual water flows on the global and national water budgets. The assessment shows that the total amount of water that would have been required in the importing countries if all imported agricultural products would have been produced domestically is 1605 Gm 3 /yr. These products are however being produced with only 1253 Gm 3 /yr in the exporting countries, saving global water resources by 352 Gm 3 /yr. This saving is 28 per cent of the international virtual water flows related to the trade of agricultural products and 6 per cent of the global water use in agriculture. National policy makers are however not interested in global water savings but in the status of national water resources. Egypt imports wheat and in doing so saves 3.6 Gm 3 /yr of its national water resources. Water use for producing export commodities can be beneficial, as for instance in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Brazil, where the use of green water resources (mainly through rain-fed agriculture) for the production of stimulant crops for export has a positive economic impact on the national economy. However, export of 28 Gm 3 /yr of national water from Thailand related to rice export is at the cost of additional pressure on its blue water resources. Importing a product which has a relatively high ratio of green to blue virtual water content saves global blue water resources that generally have a higher opportunity cost than green water.",
    "full_text": "The most direct positive effect of virtual water trade is the water savings it generates in the countries or the regions that import the products. This effect has been widely discussed in virtual water studies since the nineties (Allan, 1999;Hoekstra, 2003). These national water savings are equal to the import volumes multiplied by the volumes of water that would have been required to produce the commodities domestically. However, virtual water trade does not only generate water savings for importing countries, it also means water 'losses' for the exporting countries (in the sense that the water cannot be used anymore for other purposes in the exporting countries). The global net effect of virtual water trade between two nations will depend on the actual water volume used in the exporting country in comparison to the water volume that would have been required to produce a commodity in the importing country. There will be net water saving, if the trade is from countries with relatively high water productivity (i.e. commodities have a low virtual water content) to countries with low water productivity (commodities with a high virtual water content). There can be net additional consumption of water if the transfer is from low to high productive sites. The saving can also be realised with transfer of products from low to high productive periods by storage of food, which can be a more efficient and more environmentally friendly way of bridging the dry periods than building large dams for temporary water storage (Renault, 2003).\n\nVirtual water trade between nations is one means of increasing the efficiency of water use in the world. As Hoekstra and Hung (2002;2005) argue, there are three levels of water use efficiency. At a local level, that of the water user, water use efficiency can be increased by charging prices based on full marginal cost, stimulating water-saving technology, and creating awareness among the water users on the detrimental impacts of water abstractions. At the catchment or river basin level, water use efficiency can be enhanced by re-allocating water to those purposes with the highest marginal benefits. Finally, at the global level, water use efficiency can be increased if nations use their comparative advantage or disadvantage in terms of water availability to encourage or discourage the use of domestic water resources for producing export commodities (respectively stimulate export or import of virtual water). Whereas much research efforts have been dedicated to study water use efficiency at the local and river basin level, little efforts have been done to analyse water use efficiency at global level.\n\nAccording to the theory of comparative advantage, nations can gain from trade if they concentrate or specialize in the production of goods and services for which they have a comparative advantage, while importing goods and services for which they have a comparative disadvantage (Wichelns, 2001;2004). The pros and cons of the virtual water trade should be weighed including the opportunity cost of the associated water. Some trade flows may be more beneficial than others purely because of the higher opportunity cost of the water being saved. It is relevant for instance to look whether water saved is blue or green water. Green water is the productive use of rainfall in crop production, which, in general, has a lower opportunity cost compared to the blue water use (i.e.\n\nThe average global volume of virtual water flows related to the international trade in agricultural products was 1263 Gm 3 /yr in the period 1997-2001 (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2004). This estimate is based on the virtual water content of the products in the exporting countries. It would be interesting to see the volume of virtual water traded internationally based on the virtual water content of the products in the importing countries. Zimmer and Renault (2003) estimated this as 1340 Gm 3 /yr related to the international trade in crop and livestock products in the year 2000. These studies only present a partial view of the global or national savings.\n\nAn estimate of global virtual water trade and resulting global water saving was done by Oki et al. (2003) and Oki and Kanae (2004). They estimated the global sum of virtual water exports on the basis of the virtual water content of the products in the exporting countries (683 Gm 3 /yr) and the global sum of virtual water imports on the basis of the virtual water content of the products in the importing countries (1138 Gm 3 /yr). This saves 455 Gm 3 /yr as a result of food trade. Their study is severely limited with respect to the methodology followed in calculating the virtual water content of a product. First, they have assumed a constant global average crop water requirement throughout the world, being 15 mm/day for rice and 4 mm/day for maize, wheat and barley. Thus the climatic factor, which plays a major role in the crop water requirement of a crop, is completely neglected. Secondly, they did not take into account the role of the crop coefficient, which is the major limiting factor determining the evaporation from a crop at different stages of crop growth. The global virtual water flows and the resulting water savings as calculated in these studies are limited to the international trade of four major crops (maize, wheat, rice and barley) only.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to quantify and analyse the global and national water savings for the period 1997-2001 with proper accounting of climate, yield, and cropping pattern per crop per country. The study covers the international trade of all major crop and livestock products.\n\nThe virtual water content of a product is calculated using the methodology as developed by Hoekstra and Hung (2002;2005) and Chapagain and Hoekstra (2003;2004). First the virtual water content (m 3 /ton) of the primary crop is calculated based on crop water requirement and yield in the producing country. The crop water requirement is calculated using the methodology developed by FAO (Allen et al., 1998). The calculation is done using the climate data of the producing country and the specific cropping pattern of each crop per country. The virtual water content (m 3 /ton) of live animals has been calculated based on the virtual water content of their feed and the volumes of drinking and service water consumed during their lifetime. The virtual water content of processed products is calculated based on product fractions (ton of crop product obtained per ton of primary crop or live animal) and value fractions (the market value of one crop or livestock product divided by the aggregated market value of all products derived from one primary crop or live animal). The product fractions have been taken from the commodity trees in FAO (2003). The value fractions have been calculated based on the market prices of the various products. The global average market prices of the different products for the period 1997-2001 have been calculated using trade data from the International Trade Centre (ITC, 2004).\n\nThe national water saving ΔS n (m 3 /yr) of a country n i as a result of trade of product p is:\n\nwhere V is the virtual water content (m 3 /ton) of the product p in country n i , I the amount of product p imported (ton/yr) and E is the amount of product exported (ton/yr). Obviously, ΔS n can have a negative sign, which means a net water loss instead of a saving.\n\nThe global water saving ΔS g (m 3 /yr) through the trade of a product p from an exporting country n e to an importing country n i , is:\n\n)\n\nwhere T is the amount of trade (ton/yr) between the two countries. The global saving is thus obtained as the difference between the water productivities of the trading partners. The total global water saving can be obtained by summing up the global savings of all trades ΔS g . By definition, the total global water saving is also equal to the sum of the national savings of all countries ΔS n .\n\nThe case of global water saving is illustrated with an example of the import of husked rice in Mexico from the USA in Figure 2.1. The case of global water loss is shown with an example of export of broken rice from Thailand to Indonesia in Figure 2.2. For the computation of the total water saving that is made by international trade of agricultural products, the calculation has been carried out for 285 crop products and 123 livestock products as reported in the database PC-TAS (ITC, 2004) which covers international trade between 243 countries for 1997-2001. Mexico Virtual water content, V i = 2182 m 3 /ton National water loss S n = V e x T = 1275 x 488,195 = 0.62 x 10 9 m 3 /yr Global water saving S g = T (V i -V e ) = 488,195 x (2182 -1275) = 0.44 x 10 9 m 3 /yr Product trade T = 488,195 ton/yr National water saving S n = V i x T = 2182 x 488,195 = 1.06 x 10 9 m 3 /yr USA Virtual water content, V e = 1275 m 3 /ton Figure 2.2. An example of global water loss with the import of broken rice in Indonesia from Thailand.\n\nA large number of countries are saving their national water resources with the international trade of agricultural products. Japan saves 94 Gm 3 /yr from its domestic water resources, Mexico 65 Gm 3 /yr, Italy 59 Gm 3 /yr, China 56 Gm 3 /yr and Algeria 45 Gm 3 /yr. The global picture of national savings is presented in Figure 3.1. The water savings shown in the figure are net water savings. A net national water saving is the result of a gross water saving and a gross water loss (Appendix I). The driving forces behind international trade of water-intensive products can be water scarcity in the importing countries, but often other factors such as scarcity of fertile land or other resources play a decisive role (Yang et al., 2003). As a result, realised national water savings can only partially be explained through national water scarcity. The national water saving has different implications per country. Though Germany saves 34 Gm 3 /yr, it may be less important from a national policy making perspective because the major products behind the saving are stimulant crops (tea, coffee and cocoa) which Germany would otherwise not produce itself. If the import of stimulants is reduced, it may not create any additional pressure on the water resources in Germany. However, for Morocco, where import of cereal crop products is the largest national water saver, shifting from import to domestic production would create an additional pressure of 21 Gm 3 /yr on its national water resources. The nations that save most water through international trade of agricultural products and the main products behind the savings are presented in Table 3.1.\n\nFor an importing country it is not relevant whether products are consuming green or blue water in the exporting country. The importing country is more interested to see what volume and kind of water is being saved from its own resources by the import. And it is further important to see whether the water thus saved has higher marginal benefits than the additional cost to import these products. Cereal crops (20.9), oil-bearing crops (4.4)\n\nAs an example, Figure 3.2 shows the national water saving of Egypt as a result of the import of wheat. In Egypt, the mean rainfall is only 18 mm/yr. Almost all agriculture in Egypt is irrigated. At present, Egypt and Sudan base their water resources plan on the agreed division of water by the 1959 Nile water agreement between Sudan and Egypt. However, future developments in upstream countries will have to be taken into account. Disputes over the distribution of water of the Nile could become a potential source of conflict and contention. The expansion of irrigation in the basin will require basin-wide cooperation in the management of water resources to meet increasing demands and to face the associated environmental consequences. In this context, the import of wheat in Egypt is contributing to national water saving of 3.6 Gm 3 /yr which is about seven percent of the total volume of water Egypt is entitled to according to the 1959 agreement. The national saving is made with the investment of foreign exchange of 593 million US$/yr (ITC, 2004). Hence, from an economic point of view, the opportunity cost of the resources being saved (such as land, water and labour) should be more or at least equal to the price paid for it. If the opportunity cost of land and labour approaches zero, the opportunity cost of water being saved should be more than 0.17 US$/m 3 . But the import of wheat in Egypt should be assessed including other factors of production such as land and labour. In Egypt fertile land is also a major scarce resource. The pressure to increase the land area with reclamation is released to some extent by the wheat import but on the other hand the import is made at the cost of employment lost. Greenaway et al. (1994) and Wichelns (2001) Saving water through global trade / 15 have shown that the production of wheat has a comparative disadvantage in Egypt. As the saving is completely in blue water, the marginal utility of the saved water may justify the import economically.\n\nWhereas import of agricultural products implies that national water resources are saved, export of agricultural products entails that national water resources are lost. The term 'national water loss' is used in this paper to refer to the fact that water used for producing commodities that are consumed by people in other countries is not available anymore for in-country purposes. The term 'water loss' is used here as the opposite of 'water saving'.\n\nThe terms 'loss' and 'saving' are not to be interpreted in terms of economic loss or saving, but in a physical manner (refer to Equation 1). Calculated national water savings and losses become valued positive or negative in an economic sense depending on the context. Water losses as defined here are negative in economic sense only if the benefit in terms of foreign earning does not outweigh the costs in terms of opportunity cost and negative externalities left at the site of production.\n\nThe nations with the largest net water loss are the USA (92 Gm 3 /yr), Australia (57 Gm 3 /yr), Argentina ( 47Gm 3 /yr), Canada (43 Gm 3 /yr), Brazil (36 Gm 3 /yr) and Thailand (26 Gm 3 /yr) (Appendix I). Figure 4.1 shows the water losses of all countries that have a net water loss due to the production for export. The list of nations with the largest net water loss through the international trade of agricultural products is presented in Table 4.1. The main products behind the national water loss from the USA are oil-bearing crops and cereal crops. These products are partly produced rain-fed and partly irrigated. However the loss from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana is mainly from the export of stimulants, which are almost entirely rain-fed. The use of green water has no major competition with other uses in these countries. This type of loss to the national water resources is unlikely to be questionable from an economic perspective, because the opportunity costs of this water are low. The concern is limited to the environmental impacts, which are generally not included in the price of the export products. The national water losses from France, Vietnam and Thailand are mainly the result of cereal crop products.\n\nParticularly the example of rice export from Thailand is interesting from blue water and opportunity cost perspective (Figure 4.2). Thailand exports 27.8 Gm 3 /yr of water in the form of rice. The monetary equivalent of rice export is 1556 million US$/yr (ITC, 2004). Hence, from the loss of its national water, Thailand is generating foreign exchange of 0.06 US$/m 3 . The water loss is partly from blue water resources and partly from green water resources. As rice cultivation in Thailand is done during the rainy season, the share of green water is quite considerable in the virtual water content of the rice. Here, one needs to remember that the benefits of rice export should be attributed to all the resources consumed in the production process such as water, land and labour. If the contribution of rainfall is 50% to the total evaporative demand of the crop, and if other resources have zero opportunity cost (which is not the case) the opportunity cost of rice export from Thailand approaches 0.12 US$/m 3 of blue water. Though it is a crude estimation of opportunity cost of rice export, it indicates that the volume of national water loss could have produced higher economic benefits to the nation. Saving water through global trade / 21\n\nConsidering the international trade flows between all major countries of the world and looking at the major agricultural products being traded (285 crop products and 123 livestock products), it has been calculated that the global water saving by trade in agricultural products is 352 Gm 3 /yr (Table 5.1). This volume equals 28% of the international virtual water flows related to agricultural product trade and 6% of the global volume of water used for agricultural production (which is 6391 Gm 3 /yr, see Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2004). The trade flows that save more than 0.5 Gm 3 /yr are shown in Figure 5.1. The trade flows between USA-Japan and USA-Mexico are the biggest global water savers. The contribution of different product groups to the total global water saving is presented in Figure 5.2. Cereal crop products form the largest group responsible for the total global water saving, with a saving of 222 Gm 3 /yr, followed by oil-bearing crops (68 Gm 3 /yr, mainly soybeans) and livestock products (45 Gm 3 /yr). The cereal group is composed of wheat (103 Gm 3 /yr), maize (68 Gm 3 /yr), rice ( 21Gm 3 /yr), barley (21 Gm 3 /yr), and others (9 Gm 3 /yr). Saving compared to the sum of international virtual water flows (%) 34% 16% 30%\n\nSaving compared to the global water use for agricultural products (%) 5.3% 0.7% 6%  The largest global water savings by wheat trade are occurring as a result of wheat import in the Middle East and North African from Western Europe and North America. Figure 5.3 shows the wheat trade flows saving more than 2 Gm 3 of water per year. Maize imports in Japan alone are responsible for 15 Gm 3 /yr of global water saving. The global saving of water as a result of maize trade is mainly from the export of maize from USA. e East and North African from Western Europe and North America. Figure 5.3 shows the wheat trade flows saving more than 2 Gm 3 of water per year. Maize imports in Japan alone are responsible for 15 Gm 3 /yr of global water saving. The global saving of water as a result of maize trade is mainly from the export of maize from USA.     Considering the import of wheat in Egypt, one can see that this contributes to global water saving in some cases and global water loss in other cases (Figure 3.2). The import from USA, France and Argentina is globally saving water by 0.23 Gm 3 /yr, whereas the import of wheat from Canada, Turkey and Australia results in a global water loss of 0.58 Gm 3 /yr. Though Egypt's import of wheat saves national water resources by 3.6 Gm 3 /yr, it results in a net global water loss of 0.4 Gm 3 /yr. The crop water requirement in Egypt is relatively high compared to its\n\ntrading partners, but this is partially compensated by a relatively high wheat yield, which is more than twice the global average (Table 5.2). As a result, water productivity (water use per unit of product) in wheat production in Egypt is higher than in Canada, Turkey and Australia. However, wheat production in Egypt is using scarce blue\n\nThe global green water saving, ΔS g,g (mfoot_0 /yr), in this case is always negative:\n\nHowever, whether the global blue water saving ΔS g,b (m 3 /yr) is positive or negative depends upon the fraction f in the exporting country:\n\nThere is net gain in global blue water resources as long as the blue water component of Australian wheat is smaller than in Egypt, i.e. if the fraction f in Australia is larger than 0.42. In a case of extreme drought, if the\n\nThe volume of global water saving from the international trade of agricultural products is 352 Gm 3 /yr (average over the period [1997][1998][1999][2000][2001]. The largest savings are from international trade of crop products, mainly cereals (222 Gm 3 /yr) and oil crops (68 Gm 3 /yr), owing to the large regional differences in virtual water content of these products and the fact that these products are generally traded from water efficient to less water efficient regions.\n\nSince there is smaller variation in the virtual water content of livestock products, the savings by trade of livestock products are less.\n\nThe export of a product from a water efficient region (relatively low virtual water content of the product) to a water inefficient region (relatively high virtual water content of the product) saves water globally. This is the physical point of view. Whether trade of products from water efficient to water inefficient countries is beneficial from an economic point of view, depends on a few additional factors, such as the character of the water saving (blue or green water saving), and the differences in productivity with respect to other relevant input factors such as land and labour. Besides, international trade theory tells that it is not the absolute advantage of a country that indicates what commodities to produce but the relative advantage (Wichelns, 2004). The decision to produce locally or to import from other sites should be made on the basis of the marginal value or the utility of the water being saved at the consumption site compared to the cost of import.\n\nSaving domestic water resources in countries that have relative water scarcity by the mechanism of virtual water import (import of water-intensive products) looks very attractive. There are however a number of drawbacks that have to be taken into account as well. Saving domestic water through import should explicitly be seen in the context of:\n\nthe need to generate sufficient foreign exchange to import food which otherwise would be produced domestically; the risk of moving away from food self sufficiency that associates with the fear of being held to political ransom; increased urbanization in importing countries as import reduces employment in the agricultural sector;\n\nreduced access of the poor to food; and increased risk of environmental impact in exporting countries, which is generally not accounted for in the price of the imported products.\n\nEnhanced virtual water trade to optimise the use of global water resources can relieve the pressure on water scarce countries but may create additional pressure on the countries that produce the water-intensive commodities for export. The potential water saving from global trade is only sustainable if the prices of the export commodities truly reflect the opportunity costs and negative environmental externalities in the exporting countries. Otherwise the importing countries simply gain from the fact that they would have to bear the cost of water depletion if they would produce domestically whereas the costs remain external if they import the waterintensive commodities instead.\n\nSince an estimated 16% of the global water use is not for domestic consumption but for export, global water use efficiency becomes an important issue with increasing globalisation of trade. Though international trade is seldom done to enhance global water productivity, there is an urgent need to address the increasing global water scarcity problem.\n\nGlobal sum of virtual water imports, assessed on the basis of the virtual water content of products if produced in the importing countries\n\nin this trade."
