    "full_text": "Ann. Inst Fourier, Grenoble 18, 1(1968), 283-308\n\nThe object of this paper is the study of the behavior of solutions of elliptic differential equations at ideal boundaries of their domains. We employ the axiomatic approach of Brelot [I], i.e. we consider a sheaf 96 of real-valued functions with open domains contained in a locally compact, non-compact, connected and locally connected Hausdorff space W, with the functions satisfying certain axioms. Specifically, by a harmonic class of functions on W we mean a class 96 of real-valued continuous functions with open domains. For each open ft C W, 96^ denotes the set of functions in 96 with domains equal to ft ; it is assumed that 96^ is a real vector space. The three axioms of Brelot which 96 is assumed to satisfy are (1) a function is in 96 if and only if it is locally in 96 ; (2) there is a base for the topology ofW which consists of regions regular for 96, i.e. connected open sets co such that any continuous function / on 3co has a unique continuous extension in 96^, which is nonnegative if/is nonnegative ; (3) the upper envelope of any increasing sequence of functions in 96^ where ft is a region (i.e. open and connected) is either 4-oo or an element of 96^. In addition. we shall often assume that: (4) 1 is 96-superharmonic in W.\n\nIn the first section below, we shall establish a criterion for a point on an arbitrary ideal boundary to be a regular point with respect to the Dirichlet problem for that boundary. In the second section we shall define compactifying boundaries which contain compact subsets 1ŝ uch that sublattices 6 of the Banach lattice tf396^ of bounded functions in 96^ are isometrically isomorphic to the space of continuous functions on 1^ . This yields a simplified version of the boundary theories of Wiener and Royden. The third section will consider two harmonic (^Supported by National Science Foundation research grants (1) GP-5279, GP-4653, and ( 2 ) GP-4563 respectively.\n\nclasses 9€ and 9C where the positive functions of 9€, restricted to the complement of a fixed compact set A, are superharmonic with respect t3^C. In particular, we shall reexamine the isometric isomorphism (established in [5]) between (096^ andtf39<^ in terms of boundary correspondences, i.e. the isomorphisms between (Q9€^ and G^Cr )and between (BSC^ and (SR^).\n\nThe terminology and notation which we shall employ here are the same as in [5] with a few exceptions : script rather than German letters (9€ and3C) refer to harmonic classes. Instead of lim f(x),\n\nxeA, x ->XQ lim inf f(x) and lim sup f(x) we shall simply write limA/Oco),\n\nxeA,x ->XQ X€A,X->XQ lim inf^/C\\:o) and lim sup^ /(^o) respectively. In order that a harmonic class 9€ be called hyperbolic or parabolic on W, 1 must be superharmonic. Therefore, if 9€ is described as a hyperbolic or parabolic class it is understood that 1 is 9€ -superharmonic. Note that we use bold face to denote constant functions.\n\nThe functions H(W), H(W -A), H(3A, W -A) and H(3W , W -A), which are defined in Section 5 of [5], will be used throughout this paper. We shall frequently make use of the fact that ifv G9£and u G9€ (where 96 and 3€ are the superharmonic and subharmonic classes associated with 9C respectively) and v > u, then there is a function h eg€ such that v > h > u. The following fact will also be needed : ^PROPOSITION 0.1. -Let 9€ be a harmonic class on W with 1 € 3€^, and let H(u) denote the least 9€-harmonic majorant of an upper-bounded function u E96. Then for every pair of upper-bounded functions u^ and u^ in 9C, we have fl(u^ + u^) = H(^) + H(i^), and for every upper-bounded u G9C and nonnegative a E R,\n\nProof. -Since H(i^ 4-u^) > u^ 4-u^ , H(^ 4-u^) -u^ > H(^) > u^ , so H(^i 4-^) -HO^) > H(Mi) > u^ .\n\nThe rest is clear. • Finally, we recall that a compact set A C W is outer-regular if it is nonempty and if there exists a barrier for W ^ A at each point of 9A. Although W ^ A need not be connected, it is possible to establish the following fact: THEOREM 0.2. -Given a harmonic class 9€ on W, let C be an outer-regular compact subset o/W and ft an open neighborhood ofC. Then there is an outer-regular compact set A with C C A c ft such that W ^ A has only a finite number of components.\n\nProof. -One may assume that ft is a compact subset ofW. Let{U^} be the components of W ^ C. Since W is locally connected, each U^ is open, and since W is connected, each 8U^ == U^ ^ U^ is a nonempty subset of 3C. Now the collection {ft} U {U^}^ is an open covering of ft, and thus there is a finite collection {U^ ,. . ., U^} of components of W ^ C which covers 3ft = ft ^ ft and must therefore cover W ^ ft.\n\nn Setting A = W ^ U U,., we see that A is compact, since it is a subset of ft. Every point x in 3 A belongs to some 3U, and thus to 3C, so there is a barrier for W ^ C at x ; that barrier is clearly also a barrier for W -A at x. • Section 1.\n\nIn this section we shall discuss the Dirichlet problem for open subsets of W with respect to their boundaries in a Hausdorff space W which properly contains W as a dense (and therefore open) subspace. We shall fix W, and in the discussion below ft will mean the closure of ft in W and 9ft will mean ft ^ ft.\n\nLet 96 be a harmonic class on W. For a given open subset ft ofW, Se^ will denote the set of lower-bounded functions in 9€^, and 96t he set of upper-bounded functions in gCp . A function v € S^ will be said to be nonnegative at 8ft, or positive at 3ft respectively, if inf (lim info v(Xr.)) is nonnegative or positive respectively. With\n\nXQ€Q^, this nomenclature a definition due to Brelot [1, p. 98] takes the following form : DEFINITION. -_Let ft be an open subset of W. We say that 3ft is associated-with 3?^ if every v^.3€^ which is nonnegative at 3ft is nonnegative throughout ft. It is a consequence of a result of Constantinescu and Cornea [3, Thm. 4.1, p. 32] that 3ft is associated with 3€^ whenever ft is compact and there exists a function VGfl^ with inf^ VQc) > 0. The following proposition shows that the property of having a boundary associated with 3^ is inherited by open subsets of W, and also establishes a partial converse for open sets with compact complements. PROPOSITION_ 1.1. -//ft is an open subset o/W and F = W -W is associated with9€^, then 3ft is associated with 96^ . Conversely, if le9e^ and W -ft is compact, then F is associated with SS^ whenever 3ft is associated with 3^ .\n\nProof. ^ Suppose that F is associated with 5€^, and let v be a function inS^ which is nonnegative at 3ft. If one defines a function V by setting V = 0 in W -ft and V = v A 0 in ft, then V E^ and so V > 0, whence v > 0 also.\n\nOn the other han^ assume that W ^ ft is compact, 1 €36^, and 3ft is associated with 36^ . Let v be a function in 96^ which is nonnegative at r. Let a==minfo, inf v(x)} ; then v -a is non-V ^ew-n / negative at 9ft, whence v > QL in ft, and so v > a in W. But since inf v(x) is attained at some point in the compact set W ^ ft and v xew-n cannot take a nonpositive minimum in W, a must be zero and so v > 0 in W. • Motivated by the preceding proposition, we assume for the rest of this section that F is associated with 3€^, and we consider a fixed open Sl C W. Assume that there is a function VE9€^ with inf^ V > 0. Given a bounded real-valued function/on 3ft , let V(f, ft) denote the set{vG3^ : lim inf^v(x)>/(x) for all x C 3ft}. Let H<y,ft) or simply H(/) denote the lower envelope of the functions in V(f}^ and H(y, ft) or simply H(/) denote -H(-f). We call H(/) and H(/) the upperS€extension offin ft and the lower-S^ex tension of fin ft respectively. If H(f) = H(/), we say that / is resolutive on 3ft. Now H(f) > H(f) and the functions H(/) and H(/) belong to 96 (same proof as in [5, p. 179]). Moreover, the proof of Brelofs comparison theorem ([5], Th. 3.2) is valid in this case. Thus ifco is an open subset of ft and F is the function on 3o? such that F == / on 3co Fl 3ft and F = H(/, ft) on 3o; n ft, then H(/, ft) = H(F , a;) in co. DEFINITION. -.4 point XQ on 3ft is said to be regular for ft with respect to 9€or simply regular if for every bounded function f on 3ft the inequalities lim inf^o f(Xo) < lim info H(/) (^) < lim supo H(/) (^) <lim supgo/Oco) (1) Ao/d. To show that XQ is regular, it is clearly sufficient to show that lim sup H(f) (Xo) < lim sup f(Xo)for every bounded function fon 3ft.\n\nWe now establish a criterion for the regularity of points on 3ft.\n\n^DEFINITION. -Let XQ be a point on 3ft. A positive function b €96 defined in the intersection o/ft with an open neighborhood of XQ and for which limo b(Xo) = 0 is called an 9€-barrier (or simply a barrier) for ft at XQ . We say that there is a system of barriers for ft at XQ if there is a base @ for the neighborhood system ofxo such that on the intersection of ft with each a? € © there is defined a barrier b for\n\nat Xa with -inf . (lim info b(x^)) > 0 (such a barrier is x^e3(a;nn)-(cjn3n) -A said to belong to ft and a;). By an ^'unit-barrier for ft at XQ we mean a function b^ G ^C defined on the intersection of ft with a neighborhood of XQ , having the property that linio &, (xo) = 1 ; an S^unit barrier for ft at XQ is. a function b^ G9e satisfying the same conditions.\n\nThe same proof as [5,Thm. 3.3] will show that ifjCoJ|3ftnW and there exists a barrier b for ft at XQ and a function V € 3€^ which is bounded in a neighborhood of XQ and positive at 3ft, then XQ is a regular point for ft. To handle the points XQ € 3ft H r, we need the following theorem. THEOREM \\_2. -Let XQ be a point on 3ft. Assume that there is a function V^g^ which is bounded in a neighborhood of XQ and positive at 3ft. Assume further that there is a system of barriers, an ^unit-barrier b^ and an 3^'unit-barrier b^ for ft at XQ . Then XQ is a regular point for ft. Let £ > 0 be given. If c + £ > (Uet V == (c + £) .6^ ; if c + £ < 0, let V <= (c + £). &i . Then V e3€ and lim^ V(Xo) == c + £. Let co be an open neighborhood of XQ and co^ = (^ 0 ft. By taking a; smaller if necessary, we may assume that it has the following properties : (i)/<c 4-c on 3ft Ho; ; (ii) V is defined on o?o and c -4--< V on o?o ; (iii) VQ is bounded on a;o ; (iv) there is a barrier 6 for ft at ^ defined on o?o for which m = , inf , (lim inf,. b) (x,) > 0. x^e (3^o -(^n 8^)] \"'0 1 Let F = / on 3a^ n 9\" and F = H(/, ft) on 3c^ n ft ; then (iii) above implies that F is bounded. Setting M = \\c\\ -h sup |F[, we xe^o have -. & 4-V G ^(F , c^o) and lim(-. ^ + v) (^o) = c + £. Conm \"m ' sequently lim sup^ H(F , a)o) (x^) < c + £, and Brelot's comparison theorem gives lim sup^ H(f, ft) (^) < c + £. Since e > 0 was arbitrary, XQ is a regular point for ft. • If ft is compact, then ft is regular (in the sense that each continuous function / on 3ft can be continuously extended into ft by a function H(f, ft) G 3€) if and only if inequality (1) is satisfied at each point XQ E 3ft (see the proof of 1.3 in [5]). When ft is compact and ft is regular, the SC-extension of 1 is clearly an 96-and an 3e-unitbarrier for ft at each point XQ E 3ft ; moreover, we have the following results : PROPOSITION 1.3. -Let ft be a regular open set in W such that ft is compact and each component has at least two boundary points. Then there is a system of barriers at a point XQ € 3ft if ft has only a finite number of components or ifxo is a Gg in 3ft.\n\nProof -Similar to Prop. 3.4 in [5]. I PROPOSITION 1.4. -Let Sl be a regular region_such that S2 is compact and 9SI consists of a single point XQ . // 1G 3^ ~ 3€^ then 1-H(l, Sl) is a barrier at XQ and indeed there is a system of barriers for ft at XQ .\n\nThis section will be concerned primarily with the construction of ideal boundaries from lattices of bounded 9e-harmonic functions, where 9€ is a harmonic class hyperbolic on W. Let us note briefly some facts about the sets (fi!f€^ (called 9€ 00 by L. Lumer-Naim and others) consisting of all bounded 96 -harmonic functions on Wand ^SO^W^A consisting of all bounded SC-harmonic functions on W ^ A which vanish at 3 A (where A is an outer-regular compact set-cf. [5, § 8]). It is clear that these are ordered Banach spaces under the pointwise operations and order and the uniform norm. By agreeing to extend the functions in <%o^w-A to ^e identically zero on A, we can think of bothtfaSC^ and ^BO^W-A as ^aces of functions defined on W. Moreover, assuming Axiom IV [5 ], as we shall henceforth, both these spaces have order units, and their norms are the order norms. H(W) is the order unit fortfSS^ and H(3W ,W ^ A) is the order unit for ^V^W-A ( c ^-^so [5» Prop. 5.3]). Certain vector subspaces of these spaces, containing the order unit, are vector lattices: the one-dimensional subspace consisting of multiples of the order unit is a vector lattice; so are the spaces (Q9€^ and ^o^w-A themselves, since given any/ and g in (fi9€^ or^o^C^^ respectively, their pointwise supremum is bounded and subharmonic, and thus has a bounded least harmonic majorant in W or W ^ A respectively, which is clearly the smallest bounded harmonic function which simultaneously majorizes/and^. (If ^o^w-A 18 ^der consideration, then the fact that both / and g are majorized by a suitable multiple ofH(3W , W ^ A) insures that the least harmonic majorant of / v g vanishes at 3A). Here, however, the lattice operations are not the pointwise ones. Since we will be interested in studying vector sublattices of^BSC^y and ^o^w-A' ^et us make the convention that the symbols v^ , A^, | |^, sup^ and inf^e will denote the lattice operations in those spaces, while the unmodified symbols v, A, | |, sup and inf will denote the ordinary pointwise lattice operations.\n\nWith 9€ a hyperbolic harmonic class on W, let a Banach sublattice S ofdSSe^ or tf^o^w-A ( A an outer-regular compact set) be given. One may then form the Q-compactification [2, pp. 96-97 and 6] W* of W with Q = ^ ; this is a compact Hausdorff space containing W as a dense (and therefore open) subspace, and is determined up to homeomorphism by the property that each function /€ S has a (necessarily unique) continuous extension to W*, which extension we shall also denote by /, such that the family of all these extensions separates the points of A^ = W* -W. (If ^ C ^ 9€^^, recall that we agreed to extend all functions in (%o S^w-A to ^e zero ln A')\n\nGiven this compactification, our object is to determine a smaller, more tractable associated border contained in A^. One such border has been considered by Constantinescu and Cornea [3, § 4, p. 30] : Define FCA^ to be the intersection of all sets F ={t : /€A^, lim infp(t) = 0}, where p is an 3^-potential on W (if ® ^(S9€^) or W ~ A (if« ^^o^w-A)* we take a different approach which is more elementary and does not require the use of the Evans potentials of [3] ; the equivalence of our boundary F^to the F of [3] will be shown below.\n\nFor the sake of a unified treatment of the two cases Q C (BffC^ and ® C d3^ S^w-A ' ^et e denote the order unit of the given vector lattice 9 throughout the following. I.e., let e = H(W) if S Cdsge^, but\n\nS2 be a fixed regular inner region containing A and let q be the continuous function on W* which is harmonic on Sl -A, equal to 1 on W* -12 and equal to 0 on A. In either case, it follows from Proposition 5.3 of [5] that q -e is a potential on W or W -A respectively. Now let v be an element of 9^ or 96^ ^ respectively withnonnegative limit infimum at 1^ or at 3A U F« respectively. Given any £ > 0, the setS={^:^GAA, lim inf^y v(t) < -£} will be a closed subset of AA^I^, and since S is compact there will be a finite sum s of the form\n\nwhich is positive on S. Multiplying s by a suitable positive constant fS we can have fts larger than -inf^g^ v(x) everywhere on S. Then clearly v 4-{Ss will belong to 3€^ or 96^A respectively, and we shall have -£ < inf{lim inf^y (v + ps) (x):x E A^}. As a consequence v 4-jS? 4-£ will be nonnegative at A^ or 3 A UA^ respectively, and thus v 4-(35' 4-c > 0 on all of W or W ^ A. Letting H(^) denote the greatest 96-harmonic minorant of a given 9^-superharmonic function in W or in W ^ A respectively, we see that v 4-ps +00 ==>H(y + ^ +6) = HOC + ?( 5) + H(6) > 0 (by 0.1). Since clearly H(^) = 0, this gives v +e > H(y) 4-H(6) > 0, so y > -C for any & > 0, whence y > 0. I PROPOSITION 2.2. -Z^r U^ A^be a closed set which is a border associated with !S€^ . Then the restriction map f--> f\\ M of 9 into OR(M) is an isometry (not necessarily onto) preserving positivity in both directions.\n\nProof. -Suppose first that ^ C (%ge^ . That/G ^ is nonnegative on W if it is nonnegative on M is immediate. Since ||/|| < a is equivalent to having the two Se-superharmonic functions a + / and oc -f nonnegative, the isometry conclusion is no less immediate. In the case when C S^o^w-A' one observes that by Prop. 1.1. above the set M U 3A is a border associated with 9e\\v-A? anc ^ ^g^8 m the same way. I THEOREM 2.3. -The restriction mapping f--> f\\ FQ of înto ® R (1^) is a surjective isometry sending the order unit of $ to the order unit \\ of O^T^) and preserving the lattice operations^).\n\nProof. -By the definition of IA , the range of this restriction mapping is a sublattice ofe^Cr^) containing 1, and 1 is the image of the order unit. Since 9 separates points of 1^ and S 11^ (being iso- metric to a Banach space by 2.2 above) is a closed subspace of GR(I^), our theorem is an immediate consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (in its lattice form). I COROLLARY 2.4. -1^ is equal to the border F of [3] (^ the discussion preceding 2.1 above), and no proper closed subset ofF^ is associated with 9€ 1 ^.\n\nProof. -Given the function q defined in the proof of 2.1, we see that q -e is also a potential on W or W -A respectively ; thus r C r& . That no proper closed subset of 1^ can be associated with 3e^y follows from the observation that any such subset is contained in the set of zeros of some nonzero, nonpositive function in ®R(r^). Since F is associated [3], F = F^ . • Examples.\n\n1) Suppose W is a relatively compact regular region in some larger space Sl on which 3€ is defined. Let $ consist of all 96-harmonic functions on W which have continuous extensions to 3W ; then A^and r^ can be identified with 8W.\n\n2) Take S = dSSC^. The corresponding compactification, which we shall use in studying pairs of harmonic classes, is denoted simply by W^ ; its ideal boundary and ideal border are denoted by A^ and Fr espectively. We denote W U Fgc by W^ .\n\n3) Take 9 = ^BO^W-A ^or some compact outer-regular A. We denote the compactification given by this lattice by W^ (A), and its ideal boundary by A^(A). Its ideal border is denoted by F^ (A), while W^ (A) denotes W U F^ (A). 4) The following example illustrates the fact that the compactifications W^ and W^(A) are in general distinct. For ease in visualization, we realize the example in the plane: the space W is the union of the half-axes ]-1 , + °°[ of the x-and the ^-axes ; the harmonic class 96 is composed of the real-valued functions which are affine on the lines except possibly at their intersection, while at the intersection (the origin) the sum of their four directional derivatives in the directions outward from the origin is zero. Since functions in d? 9€^ must be constant on the positive x-and ^-axes, A^ consists (making use of the obvious natural imbedding) of the left and lower endpoints (-1,0) and (0,-1) of the two axes, together with a point at infinity which is the ideal meeting point of the positive halves of the x-and ^-axes. It is quite easy to see that (-1,0) and (0,-1) are the only points of F^ . Now suppose we let A = [1,2] in the positive half of the x-axis and consider the compactification W^ (A). Now the compactification process adjoins the points (-1,0) and (0,-1), but this time there are functions (in ^o^w-A) ^ich take different values on the infinite segments of the two axes. Hence in W^ (A), a point at °° on the x-axis and a distinct point at °° on the y-2ixis must both be adjoined; W*,and W^(A) are non-homeomorphic.\n\nAlso note that in this example there are nonzero functions h E dS9€^ which vanish on open subsets of W.\n\n1) For any 6 CtfBSe^ and any fixed XQ EW, one may define a positive linear functional of norm < 1 on ^ by p : /--> /O^). This functional is strictly positive [5, Thm. 2.1], and via the positive isometric isomorphism between ^ and ^(I^) may be thought of as a functional on the latter space, i.e., a Radon measure of total mass < 1 on r« . It is evident from the strict positivity of p that nonempty open subsets of 1^ must have strictly positive p-measure. It is possible to show (as was stated for $ = (K9€^ in [11]) that the isomorphism between ^ and ^(1^) can be given by a kernel with respect to p, when W is countable at °°. Corresponding statements, mutatis mutandis, can be made for ^ C ^ S^^A •\n\n2) The case when ^ = (BSC^y has certain additional features. GSKî s a complete lattice, a fact which follows from Hamack's principle (Axiom III). The fact that the supremum of an upward-directed majorized family {f^s is a pointwise supremum on W also shows that the measure p defined above has the property that p(sup^,/^) = sup p(/a). The hypotheses of [9, Lemma 1.3] are thus ful lied for the measure p on the space E^, , and consequently the natural\" identity\" map of G^F^) into L°°(p) is an isomorphism onto, preserving all operations (lattice and algebraic) and relations; in particular, every class in L°°(p) has a unique continuous representative function. Moreover, (Sp/r^) is the dual space of L 1 (p), and the weak* topology on the unit ball of G^(r^) = L°°(p) is identical with the topology of uniform convergence on compacta for the unit ball of (B^e^y (where one identifies G^K^ and fi^(r^)). Indeed, both these topologies are compact Hausdorff and evaluation at any point x^ €E W is easily seen to be weak* continuous.\n\n3) Among the results of the analysis above is the construction of a compact Hausdorff space F^ with the property thatdSSe^ is isometrically linear-and order-isomorphic to SpOT^), with H(W) corresponding to 1. Other constructions of such a space are possible: the Banach lattice (B?e^ is an abstract M-space with unit in the sense of Kakutani [4], H(W) being the unit. By Kakutanfs representation theorem, there exists a compact Hausdorff space X for which (BSe^y is isomorphic as an abstract M-space with unit to <°p(X), i.e., is isometrically isomorphic as a Banach lattice with H(W) corresponding to 1. This observation, at least in the classical case of harmonic functions in plane domains, is due to Stone [4, p. 999, footnote]. Another way of constructing such a space X has been given by L. Lumer-Naim [8] ; her method involves making (K3€^ into a Banach algebra with identity 1 (for which she assumes thati G9e, so 1 = H(W)).(B9e^ is then represented as algebraically isomorphic and isometric to a continuous-function algebra (3p(X), with 1 = H(W) as the identity element; it is not difficult to show that this isomorphism also preserves positivity. Still another approach offering a construction of a compact Hausdorff space X with (B96^ isometrically linear-and order-isomorphic to <°p(X) follows from the compactness of the unit wedge (i.e., the intersection of the unit ball and the positive cone) of(B96^ in the u.c.c. topology, a fact which implies that it possesses extremal points; these extremal points can be shown to form a Boolean algebra under their natural ordering, with unit H(W), operations v and A, and complementation given by subtraction from H(W). (In the present context this is quite easy to see because of the isomorphisms between (S3€^, OpO^,), and L°° (p).) The Stone space of that Boolean algebra can be shown to have the property that its continuous-function vector lattice is isomorphic to (R3€^ . (Cf. the recent paper of Taylor [10].) In [3], Constantinescu and Cornea exhibit a positive isometry between (896^ and <°p(r^), where F^ is the harmonic part of the Wiener boundary. Regardless of what method one uses to construct the compact Hausdorff space X, homeomorphic spaces result, since any such space is homeomorphic to the space formed by the extremal points of the unit wedge of the dual of (K5^ , equipped with the weak* topology. Indeed, if thediS^compactification W*; of W is constructed by the method of [6], F^ is exactly that set of extremal points. It is again possible to repeat the analysis above for the compactification obtained by using < = ^V^W-A-Let us now return to our original setting. We begin by showing that with one possible exception, any border 1^ meets the regularity criteria given in § 1 above. PROPOSITION 2.5. -Except perhaps when 6 consists only of constant functions, there is an ^-unit-barrier, an Sf^unit barrier and a system of barriers for W at each point of T^ .\n\nProof. -If e is the order unit of<^ , then it is clear that e is simultaneously an 96-and an ^C-unit-barrier for each point of 1^ , by the definition of 1^ . Supposing for the time being that 1^ has at least two points, so that there exist nonnegative continuous functions on IA which vanish at a given point without being identically zero, then we can get a system of barriers at a given point IQ € F^ . To do this, we define a class of neighborhoods of t^ b} N(y,e)={^EW* :/(0< £ and e(t) > \\ -€} v for each nonnegative /€ ^ with f(fo) = 0 and each positive £ < 1. These sets have the finite intersection property since N(/v^ g , £ A 6) C N(/\\ £) H V(g , 5).\n\nThus if U is an open subset of W* containing IQ but not containing any N(/',e), there must exist some ^ ^ IQ which belongs to all N(/*, c)^. But then, since IQ G F^, and therefore Wo) = 0 => (h v^O) Oo) = 0 = (h A^O) Oo) for any h GO, it follows readily (using the fact that e(t^) = 1 = ed^)) that ® cannot separate IQ from ^ . Since ^ ^ W because no positive harmonic function can have a zero in W, ^ must belong to A^, a conclusion which contradicts the fact that % separates points of A^ . Thus U contains some N(f, e).\n\nGiven N(/, e), set b = / 4-(1 -e) ; we claim that & is a barrier which belongs to W and N = N(/, e) 0 in the sense of the definition preceding 1.2 above. For 3N is a subset of the set {r:/0)<£ and e(t) = 1 -e}U{t:f(t) =e and e(r)>l-£}.\n\nOnly the trivial case where 1^ consists of a single point remains. If e ^ 1, it is easy to see that the function 1 -e is a barrier at that point and has positive lim inf at every other point of A ^ . On the other hand, if e =1, so W* is just the one-point compactification ofW, the assertion of the theorem is false in general; for example let 3€ be the affine functions on the space W == ]0 , oo[ . • Remark -Let W be an open Riemann surface. The above results show that a great deal of information about the harmonic part of the Wiener boundary can be obtained from an investigation of Wjjg and F^ . Also one may consider the linear space (iKfCS) consisting of all bounded harmonic functions on W with finite Dirichlet integral. It is clear that if /E^B^ecOthen |/| has finite Dirichlet integral (I/I is a Dirichlet function on W, by [2, p. 78]); by Dirichlet's principle, l/lae= Hd/DEdSa^.Letting $ be the uniform closure of 8S3VS), one may form the spaces W* A^, 1^ and W^ as above. Now let Wd enote the usual Royden compactification of W [2, p. 98] ; then, since the elements ofGS9€<S) are Dirichlet functions, there is a natural mapping p : W^ --> W* , which is onto, and it can be shown (either from the known regularity of Fp [2, p. 101] or directly) that p | r^ is a homeomorphism onto 1^. Thus W^ is a 1-1 continuous image of W U F^ under a map which is the identity on W and a homeomorphism on r^ . Consequently one can establish many properties of the harmonic part of the Royden compactification using W*. Note that r^ is <( attached\" to W with a topology which is weaker than that attaching F^ . Since a system of barriers for a point t^ E F^ can readily be seen to be a system of barriers for p~~1 (to) E F^ , we have demonstrated the existence of systems of barriers at the points of the harmonic part of the Royden boundary. Similar considerations can be given for solutions of AK = Pu on a Riemann surface W, where P > 0 is an integrable density on W ; one need only replace the usual Dirichlet bilinear form D(u , v) by the form E(u , v) = D(u , v) 4-j uvP.\n\nLet us again consider the case where $ = dSS^. The definition of A^ insures that every bounded function in g^ has a unique continuous extension to A^ ; we shall now show that every bounded function in 3€^ or ge^ has a continuous extension to Yyc . The extension is described by the next theorem, where (S3€^ and (!S9€^ denote, respectively, the cones of bounded ^-superharmonic functions and bounded ae-subharmonic functions on W. Proof -Given any v ediSC^ , let HO) denote the greatest 9e-harmonic minorant of v, and let HO) also denote the uniqve continuous extension to all of W^ . Since v -HO) is a positive potential on W, lim inf^ (v -HQ)) = 0 at 1^ , and thus 0 = lim inf^ 0 -HO)) (t) > lim mf^v(t) -h lim inf^ -HQ) W = 10) (0 -HO) W , or HO) W > 10) 0) ; but the reverse inequality is obvious. Thus 10) = HO) I r^ , showing that IQ) is continuous for each v 0(096^ . The additivity (and obvious positive homogeneity) of v --> HO), proved in 0.1 above, then immediately imply the same properties for I.B\n\nThe mapping I can now be extended in_a unique manner to the linear space of functions formed by 6Sy€^ -(R3^^ by setting I^i -^^O^-IOŵ here v^ , ^ G (f!SC^. In particular, one sees that l(u) = lim sup^ u ifuCdige^. Now let A be an outer-regular compact subset of W. It is known [5,Cor. 8.2] that(B9e^ and (BO^W-A are isometrically isomorphic ; we shall now show that this isometric isomorphism can be realized as a boundary correspondence on I^e , with the usual exception.\n\nis an isometric isomorphism, positive in both directions, of^o^e^ŵ ith <°R(r^).\n\nProof. -Since we have excluded the exceptional case of 2.5 above, 2.5 and 1.2 imply that every continuous function/on Y^ can be extended to a function continuous on (W ~ A) U r^ U 3 A which vanishes at 3A ; one simply solves the Dirichlet problem with boundary values / on F^ and 0 on 3 A. Denote the solution of that Dirichlet problem by Ho (/). By [5,Thm. 5.3], H^ (1) < H(3W , W -A); on the other hand, since\n\neverywhere on 1^ while limw.Al^V 1 ) -H < ^w , W ~ A)] = 0 on 3A, the reverse inequality holds and one has H(3W , W ~ A) == Ho(l). To prove that sup |HL(/)0)|= sup |/(01 is entirely straight-\n\nforward. To complete the proof, one need only show that every element of ^o^w-A ^as a continuous extension to (W ~ A) U r^ .\n\nGiven a nonnegative h ^^BO^W-A' consider the extension of h to W obtained by setting h = 0 on A. This extension (which we also denote by h) is bounded and subharmonic, hence the operator I of 2.6 above extends h continuously to Fge ' In fact, if a > 0 is any real number for which h < a on W ^ A, then a = I(a . Ho ( 1)\n\nThus \\{h) extends any nonnegative h in^o^e^^ to be continuous on (W ^ A) U F^ . Since ^SO^W-A ls generated by its nonnegative elements and I is linear on (JS9€^ -(f^9€^ , the theorem is proved. I COROLLARY 2.8. -// 96 is hyperbolic on W, then for any outer-regular compact A C w the spaces(RfK^ and <BO^W-A are isometrically isomorphic, with positivity preserved in both directions.\n\nProof. -If (B9€^ consists only of multiples of 1, then by 1.2 and 2.5, ^o^w-A consists of multiples of H(3W , W ~ A), whence the corollary follows for this case. lf(K9€^ does not reduce to the constants, then any function in either space has a unique continuous extension to W^ = W U r^ (vanishing identically on A in the case of ^BO^W-A)-^e i^r^try between (fH)€^ and ^BO^W-A ls g^6 11 by composing the isometry between one space and its boundary values on r^ with the inverse of the isometry between the other space and its boundary values on P^, . • This last corollary already indicates that I\\ and Fge (A) are homeomorphic spaces, since their continuous-function lattices are isometrically linearly and lattice isomorphic [4, Thm. 7, p. 1 008]. We shall now show that the borders are attached to W in the same way, i.e., that the spaces W^ = W U I\\, and W^ (A) = W U F^(A) are homeomorphic under a mapping which extends the identity mapping on W. Thus with the exception of the one trivial excluded case, we can reduce all considerations to a single space W^e , and we shall see that W^c (A) was in fact independent of A. THEOREM 2.9. -Suppose 96 is hyperbolic and (096^ does not reduce to the constants. Let A be an outer-regular compact set. Then there is a unique continuous mapping j : W^e --^ W^ (A) for which j | W = identity and which is a homeomorphism of the two spaces. j | r^ may be described in the following way : if ho GJBo^e^^, then ho (j(s)) = ho ( 5 ') f 019 a ^ s G ^e ' where ho (s) is the boundary value of hQ at s e: r^ .\n\nProof. -Having defined j on W by the identity mapping, we extend / to r^ as follows : let ^ be a filter in W whose limit in W^ is s^F^ . Then for any ^o^^o^w-A' dearly lim^/z^ = ho (s) ; but looking at ^ in W^ (A) it is clear, since ^ contains the complements of compact sets, that ^ can have limit points on A^(A) only. Since lim^ hQ = AQ (s), ^BO^W-A cannot distinguish those limit points and S 1 must therefore be convergent to a point 7(5') E A^e(A). This defines; ; reexamining the argument shows that / must now be continuous from W^ to W^ (A). We had observed above that by [4,Thm. 7] for each point s € r^ there had to be one and only one point t E F^ (A) for which HQ^S) = HQ^I) for every ^Ed^S^^ ; since we have found such a point /(5)GA^(A) and ^BQ^W-A ^parates the points of A^(A), we see that f(s) is the point t corresponding to s by the Kakutani theorem. Thus / maps F^ 1-1 onto F^ (A) and / | Fgc is already seen to be a homeomorphism.\n\nWe now have 7 sending W^ 1-1 onto W^ (A), so / -1 is well defined ; it remains to show that it is continuous. Since its restrictions to W and to F^ (A) are clearly continuous, it suffices to show that ifî s a filter in W with limit t e E^ (A), and if t = j(s), then for every h GdSSe^ one has lim h = h(s). Suppose that /E ^(F^ ) is a nonnegative continuous function which takes its maximum value at s = / -1 (0, and let h and h^ be the elements of^BS^ and ^o^w-A respectively which take the boundary values given by/. Since h -h^ is Se-superharmonic on W and nonnegative at Y^ , it is nonnegative on W. Consequently lim inf^ h > lim inf ^ h^ = lim ^h^ = f(s) ; but the inequality /C?) > /?(jc) for all ;c ^ W is clear, and therefore lim 3; h =f(s). Since functions / satisfying the description above generate ^(T^ ), we have lim^; h = h(s) for any /? G<B9e^ ; consequently / -1 sends the filter ^ to a filter which converges to s = j~1 (t\\ and continuity is proved. • We may consequently cease to distinguish between W^ and W^ (A), F^ and F^ (A), and we shall simply delete the \"(A)\". The interested reader may consider the exceptional case where (Si3€ĉ onsists only of constants.\n\nThis section will be concerned with the boundary behavior of functions in a pair (SC ,9C) of harmonic classes where 9€ > 3< in the sense of [5, § 7 ff.]. We shall fix 36 and 3<: throughout the section and assume that 1 € 9€^ and 1 G 3<^ . We shall also fix an outer-regular compact set A ^ W which is an excluded set for the pair (96, 3<) in the sense of [5, § 7], that is, a set with S^ | W -A C 3C. By 0.2 above, there is no loss of generality in assuming that W ^ A has only finitely many components. Proof. -By the \"converse\" part of 1.1 above, it suffices to show that any v ^3<-w-A ^ich is nonnegative at 3(W ^ A) is nonnegative. But given any such v, the function v A 0 is in9€^^ by [5,Prop. 7.2 (iv)]. Consequently, since v A 0 is clearly nonnegative at 3(W ^ A) and 3(W ^ A) is associated with 9€ 1 ^^, we must have v A 0 > 0, or v > 0, on W -A. • PROPOSITION 3.2. -Let W he a Hausdorff space of which W is a proper dense subspace. If there are no positive SC'harmonic !K.potentials in W -A, then H(3W , W ~ A) is the least 9€-harmonic majorant of K(3W , W -A). //H(3W , W -A) is the leasts-harmonic maforant of K(8W_W -A) and 3W is associated with 9C^, then 3W is associated with 3^.\n\nProof. -Let h^ be the least SC-harmonic majorant ofK(3W , W ~ A). The first statement follows from the fact that H(3W , W -A) -h^ is a ^potential. To prove the second statement let V be a function in 96^^ which is nonnegative at 3(W ~ A), and for the purpose of arriving at a contradiction, suppose that a = -inf VQc) > 0 xeW-A (see 1.1). We may replace Vbyy ==(~~v) AO and reduce the problem ^a ' to considering a nonpositive function yEge^^ which has limit 0 at 3(W ^ A) and whose infimum on W ~ A is -1. The nonnegative function -v is 9^-subharmonic on W ^ A, has limit 0 at 3A, and has supremum 1 ;by the characterization ofH(3W , W ^ A) of [5, Prop..7.2 (iv)], it follows that -v < H(3W , W ~ A), or 0 < H(3W , W -A) + v. The function on the right of this inequality belongs to 96^^ anc * ls nonnegative, so it belongs to ^<\\v^; hence H(3W , W -A) 4-v -K(3W , W -A) e^w-A and is nonnegative at 3(W ^ A), because HOW , W -A) -K(3W , W -A) > 0 .\n\nSince 3(W ^ A) is associated with 96^ Ĥ(3W , W ~ A) + v -K(3W , W -A) > 0 holds everywhere in W ^ A. This can be written as\n\nsince the left side is 9e-superharmonic and the right side 9^-subharmonic, the inequality is unaltered by replacing KQW , W ^ A) by its least 96-harmonic majorant: H(3W , W -A) 4-v > H(3W , W -A), or v > 0. This finishes the proof. •\n\nIn order to motivate the next theorems, we consider the following example : let W = ]0, 1[, let 3€ be the class of solutions of u\" = 0, and 3<: be the class of solutions of x 2 . u 19 = 2u, a basis for which is ( 1 ^ -, x 2 ^ . It is easily verified that 3€ > 9<:, that W^ = WJ^ = [0 , 1 ],\n\nand that 1^ j= {0 , 1} but F^c = {1}. It is immediate that 1\"^ is associated with 9^ but not with 9€^. And although Fjc is regular for W and 3C, and 1^ is regular for W and 96, F^ is not regular for W and 9^C ; indeed, every bounded function in 3C must vanish at 0. The difficulty in this case lies with barriers: clearly every SC-barrier is a3<:barrier, but there is no 3C-unit-barrier at the point 0 E F^e = 9W. This example, incidentally, will also prove useful in demonstrating the sharpness of 3.7 below.\n\nThe following two theorems provide a partial answer to the question \" under what conditions does the regularity ofW (as a dense subspace of a Hausdorff space W) with respect to one of two comparable classes 96 and 9<: imply its regularity with respect to the other ?\" THEOREM 3.3. -Let W be a^ Hausdorff space containing W as a dense subspace such that 3W = W -W is associated with 9€^ (and thus with 3<:^, by 3.1 above). Let XQ E 3W. If there is aSC-unit-barrier u for W at XQ and a system of W^barriers for W at XQ, then there is an ^unit-barrier for W at XQ and a system of ^-barriers for W at XQ , whence XQ is a regular point with respect to 3€.\n\nProof. -It is clear that u v 0 is an ^C-unit-barrier at XQ . Since XQ is regular with respect to 9<: (by 1. satisfies the conditions for an 3C-barrier for W at XQ , and since H(3W , W -A) > KQW , W -A), b is positive wherever b^ is positive ; in particular, since &o is positive at 3(o? HW) -(co H 3W), b is positive there also. Thus there is a system of 96-barriers for W at XQ . • THEOREM 3.4. -Let W be a compact Hausdorff space containing W as a dense subspace. Assume either that 3W = W ^ W has at least two points or that 1 ^ 9€^ and 1 ^.Wi^ . Then W (as a subset of W) is regular with respect to 9C if it is regular with respect to 3€ and there is a ^unit-barrier at each point of 3W. Proof. -We prove only the first part of the theorem ; the other half is similar. Since 1 is 9^-superharmonic, we have H(1,W) <1 and H(l, W) < H(l, W), whence 1 is 9e-resolutive on 3W. Making the convention (as we did in § 2 above) that functions indi^SC^^^ are to be thought of as extended (continuously) to all of W by setting them equal to 0 on A, we see that iffeisa nonnegative element of ^o^w-A» then k e3e. Consequently k < H(k \\ 3W , W), whence\n\nand k \\ BW is 36-resolutive. It is known [1, pp. 100 ff.] that the set of flC-resolutive continuous functions on BW forms a closed vector sublattice of <°R(8W), and we have shown that this sublattice contains 1 and contains ^BO^W-AI 8W (since (B^ 9C^ ^ is generated by its nonnegative elements). Since ^o^w-Al aw separates points of 8W, the lattice form of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies that the S^resolutive continuous function on 9W constitute all of e^(8W). •\n\nIn [5, § 8], one of the authors showed that there is an isometric isomorphism from (B9<^ into (f^SC^ when 96 and 3C are both hyperbolic on W. We shall now reestablish that isomorphism, realizing it by identifying functions with their boundary values on 1^ and 1^ . THEOREM 3.6. -Let 3€ and 3K: be hyperbolic on W and assume thaKfSSK,^ does not reduce to multiples o/l. Then there are isometric isomorphisms o/tf33C^ and ^o^w-A onto subspaces of(Q3€^ and ^^^S^n by\n\n\\^here for any continuous f defined on I^c , K^C/) means the unique element of^SC^^ whose restriction to 1^ is f. The isomorphisms of tf?o^w-A mto ^^w anc ^ ^O^W-A respectively send nonnegative functions fc^^o^w-A to ^^r leasts-harmonic majorants on W or W ^ A respectively, and all isomorphisms preserve boundary values on I^c .\n\nProof. -It is clear that each of the mappings constructed above is a composition of isometries and is thus an isometry. Boundary values at Fjc are preserved because the points of Fjc are regular for W and A^(A) with respect to 96, by 3.4 above. (It should be observed, however, that elements of(ii3€^ or^o^C^^ are not in general determined by their boundary values at 1^ , since the latter may not be associated with 3€^.) Finally, the mapping which sends each nonnegative k in ^BO^W-A lnto ^e Unction H(fc|A^(A),W) surely sends k to its least 9C-harmonic majorant, for Ajc(A) compactifies W and k is continuous on W^ (A) = W U A ^ (A), so any function s E 3€^ has lim inf^ s > k on A jc(A) if and only if s > k on all ofW. The argument for sending k --> H[k \\ (A^(A) U 3 A), W -A] is identical.\n\nNote that ifd39<^ consists only of the constant functions, then ^O^W-A = ^O^W-A slnce 1 ls ^ot ^ ^\" anc * 3^-harmonic in W ^ A (see 7.3 of [5]). This fact together with 2.8 implies that in this case there are isometric isomorphisms of (fKK.^ and tfSo^C^y^ onto (096â nd ^o^-A-THEOREM 3.7. -Assume that neither (Q9€^ nor (B3<:^ reduces to the constant functions. There is a continuous (necessarily unique) mapping f : W^ --> W^ v^hich extends the identity mapping on W and which is determined by the following property : if k E (BQ^W-A ' then H(fe | A ^c(A) U 3A, W ^ A) takes the same value atf(t) as k does at t, where rEFjc . The mapping f is 1-1, and thus establishes a homeomorphism between F^ and /[F^] = C C r^ ; C is open and closed in F^ .\n\nProof. -Each nonnegative element of <%o^w-A belongs to SC^A' so ^ ^(^) denotes the greatest O^C-harmonic minorant of a nonnegative h G^^e ^^ ( on ^ set ^ ^^)» ^en the map h --> K(A) is additive and positively homogeneous by 0.1 (applied to each component ofW^ A), and it has an additive extension to (BO^W-A-Since h -K(h) is a 9C-potential on W ^ A for any nonnegative AG^Se^^, one has lim inf^^h = lim K(h) at I\\ , and the right side of that equation is a continuous function (cf. 2.7 above). Furthermore, the inequality 1 > H(3W , W -A) > K(3W , W -A) implies that H(3W , W ^ A) has limit 1 at each point of F^ .A straightforward modification of the argument employed in the proof of 2.7 above will now show that Um inf\\y^ h = K(A) = lim sup^y^ h at each point of F^ . Consequently, extending h to take the same boundary values as K(A) on I\\ yields a continuous extension (obviously the unique such extension) of h to W ^ = W U F^ . Thus, as in the proof of 2.9 above, the identity mapping on W can be continuously extended to map Wgg into W^(A) ; denote that extension by/. (Cf. the construction of Wjjg (A) given by the method of [6].) It follows readily from the facts that every 9€ -potential on W ^ A is a 3Cpotential on W -A and that HQW , W -A) has limit 1 at Ijc , that /[F ] C r^, ; denote /[F^] by C. By 3.6 above, every continuous function on F^ is a set of boundary values for an appropriate element ofcBoffe^A' so ^e elements of^S^^ (or, more accurately, their extensions to F^ ) separate the points of I\\ ; consequently/is 1-1, so C and F^ are homeomorphic.\n\nIt remains to show that C is open and closed in F^ . To show this, we begin by observing that for a nonnegative h G^^e^^ to be aye-potential it is necessary and sufficient that it takes zero boundary values on C, because then it also takes zero boundary values on F^ and thus can have no nonzero nonnegative 3C-harmonic minorant. We claim that there is a largest ^-harmonic 3^-potential dominated by H(9W , W ~ A). Indeed, let h^ be the least 9C-harmonic majorant of KQW , W ~ A), so that the function p = HQW , W ~ A) -h^ is the greatest ge-harmonic minorant of H(3W , W -A) -K(3W , W -A) ; since the latter is a 3C-potential (cf. 3.2 above), so is p. Now, if h is any 9e-harmonic 9K^-potential and h < H(3W , W ^ A), then [H(3W , W -A) -h] -K(3W , W -A) is 3C-superharmonic on W ^ A, with limit zero on 3A ; on the other hand, since h has limit zero at F^ , one has 0 < [H(3W , W -A) -h] -KQW , W ~ A) at r^ . Hence (since 3AUrjc is associated with9<^^) one has 0 < HOW , W ~ A) -h -KQW , W -A), or h < HOW , W -A) -KQW , W -A) , everywhere on W ~ A, whence h <p. Clearly p takes the value zero on C ; if on the other hand p(^) < ^ 1 f 01 some t^ E Fgc ^ C, then there is an /E GR^ ) for which /[C] = 0, 0 </< 1 -p, and"
