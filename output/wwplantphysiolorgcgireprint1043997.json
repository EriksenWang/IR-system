    "full_text": "The light-regulated expression of eight nuclear-encoded genes for plastid proteins from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) (RBCS-1 and CAB-1; ATPC and ATPD, encoding the subunits y and 6 of the ATP synthase; PC and FNR; PSAD and PSAF, encoding the subunits II and 111 of photosystem I reaction center) was analyzed with promoter/&glucuronidase (CUS) gene fusions in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) seedlings and mature plants under standardized light and growth conditions. Unique response patterns were found for each of these promoters. CUS activities differed more than 30-fold. Strong promoters were found for the PC and PSAD genes. On the other hand, the ATPC promoter was relatively weak. Expression of the CAS/CUS gene fusion in etiolated material was at the detection limit; all other chimeric genes were expressed in the dark as well. Light stimulation of CUS activities ranged from 3- (FNR promoter) to more than 100-fold (CAB-1 promoter). The FNR promoter responded only to red light (RL) and not significantly to blue light (BL), whereas the PC promoter contained regions with different sensitivities toward RL and BL. Furthermore, different RNA accumulation kinetics were observed for the PSAF, CAB, FNR, and PC promoter/CUS gene fusions during de-etiolation, which, at least in the case of the PSAF gene, differed from the regulation of the corresponding endogenous genes in spinach and tobacco. The results suggest either that not all cis elements determining light-regulated and quantitative expression are present on the spinach promoter fragments used or that the spinach cis-regulatory elements respond differently to the host (tobacco) regulatory pathway(s). Furthermore, as in tobacco, but not in spinach, the trans-gene hardly responds to single light pulses that operate through phytochrome. Taken together, the results suggest that the genes have been independently translocated from the organelle to the nucleus during phylogeny. Furthermore, each gene seems to have acquired a unique set of regulatory elements.\n\nLight plays a crucial role for plant growth and development. It is absorbed by at least three photosystems (phytochromes, blue/UV-A light photoreceptors, and a UV-B photoreceptor; Kendrick and Kronenberg, 1986;Gilmartin et al., 1990;Thompson and White, 1991;Ahmand and Cashmore, 1993). The perceived light signals are transduced to responsive genes via largely unknown signal pathways. Four Arabidopsis thaliana mutants (det-1, det-2, cop-1, cop-9) and one pea mutant (lipl) have been isolated in which signal perception is uncoupled from the expression of normally lightregulated genes (Chory et al., 1986(Chory et al., , 1989;;Deng et al., 1991;Frances et al., 1992;Wei and Deng, 1992). Since these mutations are pleiotropic, important functions in early steps of the transduction chain(s) must have been impaired. At the other end of the pathway(s), a variety of cis-regulatory elements have been identified that specifically interact with families of related proteins (cf. Dehesh et al., 1990;Gilmartin et al., 1990;Schindler and Cashmore, 1990;Liibberstedt et al., 1994). GT-1-binding sites, GPu(T/A)AA(T/A), for example, have been found in the upstream regions of various light-regulated genes (Stockhaus et al., 1987;Manzara and Gruissem, 1988;Kay et al., 1989;Dehesh et al., 1990;Liibberstedt et al., 1994). The core element of the G-box sequence (CACGTG), in tum, is not only present in promoters of lightregulated genes (Giuliano et al., 1988;Schulze-Lefert et al., 1989;Staiger et al., 1989;Donald and Cashmore, 1990;Weisshaar et al., 1991), but also in promoters that are regulated by other stimuli (cf. Marcotte et al., 1989;DeLisle and Ferl, 1990). Weisshaar et al. (1991) and Armstrong et al. (1992) have shown that four of the nucleotide residues of the G-box element, ACGT, are found in several diversely regulated plant, viral, and bacterial promoters and bind to conserved homodimeric and heterodimeric leucine zipper proteins. Even though several other protein factors have been described or isolated that interact with upstream elements in light-regulated gene promoters (cf. Datta and Cashmore, 1989;Gilmartin et al., 1990;Sarokin and Chua, 1992), the current view is that the linkage between the early steps in signal transduction and responsive genes rests on only a limited number of conserved cis-and trans-acting elements.\n\nThis view is not easily reconciled with observations that the expression of light-responsive genes can differ substantially with regard to light requirement, light intensity, time course, induction, and phytochrome escape kinetics (Thompson and White, 1991). Even closely related genes in the same organisms can exhibit different responses to light. Pea appears to possess at least two classes of CAB genes, one with a strong and fast response to RL, another with only little or no transcript accumulation within the first 24 h after light 'This paper is dedicated to Prof. W. Riidiger on the occasion of his 60th birthday. This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 184). S.S. was supported by the Alexander-von-Humboldt-Stiftung, Bonn.\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 104, 1994 treatment (White et al., 1992). Furthermore, major cis determinants for qualitative (light regulated) and quantitative expression are found not only upstream of the transcription start site but also within or downstream of transcribed regions. The promoter of the pea Fed-1 gene, for instance, confers organ specificity and contributes to the light response in etiolated material, whereas elements located within the transcribed region play a more dominant role in modulating expression when the gene is active (Gallo-Meagher et al., 1992). The eight petunia RBCS genes, in tum, show a high degree of nucleotide sequence similarity within their 5' and 3' flanking sequences, but their transcription rates vary by 2 orders of magnitude (Dean et al., l985,1987(Dean et al., l985, ,1989a(Dean et al., l985, , 1989b)). Important regulatory elements for the quantitative expression of these genes are located downstream of the transcription start site, in contrast to a pea RBCS gene, in which downstream sequences do not affect steady-state transcript abundance (Kuhlemeier et al., 1988). These examples illustrate that nuclear gene transcription is probably more diverse and complex than currently anticipated and that elements determining not only the quantitative but also the qualitative ( e g light regulated) expression may be spread out in quite different gene regions.\n\nPhotophysiological studies with etiolated spinach seedlings have suggested that the steady-state mRNA levels of nuclear genes for thylakoid membrane proteins seem to be under comparable photocontrol, i.e. their levels increase with almost identical kinetics during de-etiolation (Herrmann et al., 1991(Herrmann et al., , 1992;;Bolle et al., 1992;Flieger et al., 1993). The observed similarities in mRNA accumulation appear to find no equivalent in the organization of the corresponding promoters (Oelmiiller et al., 1992). In fact, promoter architectures differ substantially as judged from an analysis of chimeric GUS gene fusions in transgenic tobacco. Taking advantage of transgenic tobacco seeds with various spinach promoter/GUS gene fusions, we have analyzed GUS gene expression in developing seedlings and adult plants grown under standardized light conditions. Our data indicate that the eight promoters selected differ substantially in strength, that important cis elements for their quantitative expression are located in different regions upstream of the respective transcription start sites, and that light-responsive elements with different sensitivities toward RL and BL can be distinguished.\n\nMost methods used for gene manipulation and plant transformation have been described (Flieger et al., 1993;Oelmüller et al., 1993) or are standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989). These include construction of promoter/GUS gene fusions in the binary vector pBI 101.2 (Jefferson, 1987;Jefferson et al., 1987), leaf disc transformation of Nicotiana tabacum Samsun NN, nucleotide sequencing, oligonucleotide synthesis, and primer extension analysis. For the results shown in Table 11, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia was transformed with the -1 126-to +60-bp PC promoter/leader fragment. under conditions specified in the German 'Gentechnikgesetz.\" Seeds were collected from individual plants and stored at 4OC for at least 2 months. Between 25 and 100 seeds were plated onto half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with agarose (0.6%) artd Suc (1%) in sterile Petri dishes and kept in RL for 12 h in temperature-controlled growth chambers (25.0 +-0.5OC) to synchronize germination. The growth chambers were equipped with cool-white fluorescent lamps (Osram L18W/30 and Osram L18W/25) and RL or BL Plexiglas filters (6 mm thick, gs 502 for RL and gs 602 for BL; Rohm GmBH, Darmstadt, Germany). Except for the greening experiment (Fig. 5), for which 30 W m-' was used, the light intensities for a11 other experiments were 5 W m-'. After 12 h. in RL, the dishes were transferred to the specified light sources. Under these conditions the germination rate was between 70 and 90%. \"Etiolated\" seedlings were exposed to the same pretreatment but were then kept in darkness.\n\nIn pilot experiments it was shown spectrophotometically that a 5-min RL pulse suffices to convert the maximum amount of Pr to Pfr (Pfr/P,,, = 0.83) and that reversion of Pfr to Pr by a 10-min exposure to far-red light establishes a Pfr/P,,, ratio of less than 0.02 in etiolated tobacco seedlings. The Pfr/P,, ratio in BL and WL was 0.43 and 0.46, respectively (data not shown).\n\nStandardized conditions'were used for quantitative determination of GUS activities in transgenic F1 plants and seedlings following in principle the protocol of Jefferson et al. (1987). Twenty pairs of cotyledons or 1 cm2 of leaf material was harvested and immediately used for the enzyme assay. The material was homogenized on ice in 1 mL of extraction buffer (50 m Na3P04 [pH 7.01, 10 m EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100,l m~ mercaptoethanol) and quartz sand. The homogenate was clarified by two centrifugations (each 10 min; 20,00Og, 4OC). Supernatants (2 pL) were used for the determination of protein concentrations (Bradford, 1976). The enzyme reaction was performed at 37OC for 15 min with 70 PL of extraction buffer, 10 pL of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (10 m) dissolved in extraction buffer, and 20 pL of extract. The reaction was stopped by adding 400 pL of Na2C03 solution (0.2 M) and further diluted between 100and 10,000-fold with the same solution prior to fluorometric determination of the reaction product, 4-MU, in a total volume of 1 mL using the LS lumenescense spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Überlingen, Germany). Emi jsion was measured at 455 nm after fluorescense excitation at 365 nm. Under these conditions accumulation of the reaction product was linear with regard to enzyme amount and time. Furthermore, determination of GUS activity in leaves (6-10 cm long) from the s8ame plant gave comparable results. No h a n g e in the enzyme activity was noted if the crude extract was kept on ice for 3 h. em and dot blot analysis. DNA fragments, cloned into pBSC+ (Stratagene), were isolated from agarose gels after restriction of plasmid DNA and labeled by random priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). Hybridization was performed as described previously (Oelmüller and Briggs, 1990). The specificity of the probe was checked by northem analysis; only single mRNA species with correct electrophoretic mobilities hybridized to the respective radiolabeled DNA fragments. For a11 dot blot filters, the low leve1 of background hybridization was monitored individually by the addition of control RNA that did not hybridize to the probe, and the sample values were corrected accordingly.\n\nPrimary transformants were selfed and their seeds collected individually. The seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.6% agar in the presence of 300 pg mL-' of kanamycin. After 30 d of growth, the segregation ratios could be readily determined. Kanamycin-sensitive seedlings were completely bleached. Analysis of segregation ratios revealed that the majority of the primary transformants contained more than one transgenic locus (data not shown).\n\nPlant material was harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The material was then ground with a mortar and pestle and resuspended in 2 volumes (w/v) of extraction buffer (9OoC, 50 mM LiCl, 0.5% SDS, 50 m~ Tris-NaOH [pH 9.01, 2 mM EDTA, 50% [w/v] phenol). After phenol-chloroform extraction, RNA was precipitated in the presence of 3 M LiCl at 4OC ovemight and collected by high-speed centrifugation (20,00Og, 30 min). The DNA was precipitated from the supematant with isopropanol(O.6 volume) and removed from the solution with a sterile glass tip, redissolved in a small volume of buffer (10 m~ Tris-HC1 [pH 8.01, 1 mM EDTA), precipitated again in the presence of 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed once with 70% ethanol, and solubilized in the above buffer with 1 mM MgCI2. DNA aliquots, together with gene-or promoter-specific primers, were used for the PCR following the protocol supplied by Perkin-Elmer Cetus (Überlingen, Germany).\n\nThe -298-to -78-bp RBCS-1 promoter fragment was amplified by PCR from spinach DNA. The promoter-specific primers were designed according to Tittgen (1987). The PCR product was cloned into the SmaI site of pBSC+ (Stratagene) before insertion into pUC-GUS-90, a vector in which the -90-to +3-bp 35s RNA CaMV minimal promoter was cloned in front of the GUS reporter gene (Oelmiiller et al., 1993). Two oligonucleotides with the RBCS-1 G-box sequence were synthesized, annealed, and cloned as a blunt-end fragment into SmaI-digested pBSC+ before being cloned in front of the 35s l7NA CaMV minimal promoter. A11 plasmid constructs were sequenced with commercially available or synthesized primers.\n\nPromoter fragments from eight nuclear genes for plastid proteins that were analyzed in this study are summarized in Table I. The GUS activities in tobacco plants (F, generation) directed by the promoters from six nuclear genes for thylakoid membrane proteins are compared in Figure 1. Four of them, ATPC and ATPD, encoding the y and 6 subunits of the plastid ATP synthase, and the FNR and PC genes are singlecopy genes in spinach (Bichler and Herrmann, 1990;Herrmann et al., 1991;Bolle et al., 1992;Oelmiiller et al., 1992Oelmiiller et al., , 1993)). Two truncated promoter fragments from the spinach multicopy RBCS and C A B gene families with 300-to 400-bp segments upstream of the respective transcription start sites were included as well. A11 promoter fragments used contained the complete or almost complete 5' untranslated leader sequence (Table I). Except for the CAB-I, RBCS-I, and CaMV promoter fragments, for which only one fragment was analyzed, 5' extension of the promoter fragments did not result in higher GUS levels (data not shown). Longer PSAF promoter fragments, however, resulted in decreased GUS activities (Flieger et al., 1993). In spite of the variation of GUS levels in individual plants harboring the same trans-gene, the GUS\n\nTable I.

Vol. 104,1994 activity in the leaves, as well as in the cotyledons of tobacco seedlings (see below), differs substantially among promoters (Fig. 1). This could imply that the upstream regions of these genes are different in strength or so divergent that they respond differently to tobacco regulatory pathways or that essential cis elements that determine quantitative expression are not present in the chosen promoter fragments. Finally, since the GUS mRNAs contain different 5' untranslated leaders that derive from the spinach genes (Table I), posttranscriptional mechanisms cannot be excluded (see \"Discussion\").\n\nThe effect of RL, BL, and WL on the accumulation of GUS activity in transgenic tobacco seedlings is compared in Figure 2. For these experiments seeds were germinated in RL for 12 h before transfer to darkness or to the indicated light regimes for an additional 12 d. With the exception of chimeric GUS fusions with the 35s RNA CaMV (-1583 to +3), FNR (-28 to +231), and CAB-1\n\n(-77 to i-71) promoter fragments and the G-box sequences (see below), light-grown seedlings express higher GUS levels than mat'erial kept in darkness. However, the extent of light stimulation and effectiveness of the three light qualities differ. The valms in Figure 2 are averages from the analysis of 20 seedlings that derive from 10 to 15 primary trarisformants for each promoter construct. The offspring of each primary transformant were analyzed separately before the data were combined for the presentation. Because of the enormous variation in absolute expression levels of the reporter gene, the SES of the mean values in Figure 2 are often too high to demonstrate significant differences between two physiological conditions. For the following conclusions, an effect was considered specific if it was observed in the seedling populations from all independent primary transformants with the same construct.\n\nExpressio,n in Etiolated Seedlings GUS activities were already detectable in etiolated material and were stimulated 2-to 5-fold (average values) upon illumination. The only exception is the CAB-1 pronioter/GUS gene fusion (-377 to +71), which was not, or riot significantly, expressed in the dark and was stimulated at least 100fold by light.\n\nNo FNR promoter constructs that responded to ItL and WL (-118 to +231; -313 to +231; -753 to +231) responded significantly to BL, in contrast to the results obtairied for the PC, ATPC, PSAF, CAB-1, and RBCS-1 constructs, which respond to a11 three light qualities. This indicates a promoterspecific response pattern to different wavelengths (see \"Discussion\"). In addition, significant changes in the sensitivities toward RL and BL were observed when the PSAF and PC promoters were deleted from their 5' ends. A11 three PSAF promoter fragments tested respond comparably to BL, but the shortest fragment is more sensitive to RL compared to the longer fragments (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the finding that upstream sequences in this promoter appear to exert RL-dependent silencing functions (Flieger et al., 1993).\n\nIn the PC promoter, the -168 to +60 promoter fragment is less effective than the -259 to +60 fragment, a result that is consistent with previous observations that essentiiil elements determining the quantitative expression of the PC gene are located between -259 and -169 bp (Lübberstedt eí al., 1994). However, if relative effects are compared, the -11216-to +60and -259-to +60-bp fragments respond equally to BL, RL, and WL, whereas a11 independent primary transformants harboring the -168-to +60-bp fragment respond more strongly to BL and WL as compared to RL (Fig. 2).\n\nA more detailed analysis for this promoter is shown in Figure 3. If only relative values are considerecl, RL was slightly more effective in the cases of the -259-to +60-and -202-to +60-bp fragments, equally as effective a!; BL in the case of the -174-to +60-bp fragment, and approximately 3 times less effective in case of the -168-to +60-bp fragment. The -146-to +60-bp fragment was inactive (T. Liibberstedt, R. Oelmuller, G. Wanner, R.G. Hermann, unpublished data). This indicates that the -168-to +60-bp region is more responsive to BL than to RL, whereas sequences located between -259 and -169 contain cis elements, which interact more specifically with the RL-dependent signal pathway.\n\nLight regulation directed by the -296-to -77-bp RBCS promoter fragment fused to the 90-bp CaMV minimal promoter is shown in Figure 2 (KBCS-1/CaMV). This region contains a G-box motif (5'-TCCACGTGGT-3', located at position -219 to -212; for sequence see EMBL accession No. X73236) that is known to be essential for the expression of various light-regulated genes. The importance of this region has been verified by exchanging the two central CG to TA residues, which leads to an almost complete loss of GUS gene expression (Fig. 2, RBCS, CG -> TA). A trimer of the authentic motif, fused to the 90-bp CaMV minimal promoter, is highly active in roots (Fig. 4) and cotyledons of etiolated seedlings (Fig. 2, G-box), and this activity is inhibited by WL, RL, and BL. The mutant G-box sequence (5'-TCCAatTGGT-3') is hardly active (Figs. 2 and 4). Furthermore, it is worth noting that the GUS activity directed by the G-box trimer in etiolated material and roots is comparable to that of the entire -296to +80-bp RBCS-1 promoter fragment in green tissue and to the levels obtained with the \"full-length\" ATPC promoter construct in light (Fig. 2).\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that light-regulated gene expression can be wavelength dependent. At least in part, this is based on elements with different sensitivities toward RL and BL. The response to BL, RL, and/or WL is promoter specific. Light regulation requires the arrangement\n\n-168/+60 -174/+60 -202/+60 -259/+60 Figure 3.

An isolated cis element can be functional in plants but exhibits quite a different expression pattern in the context of its promoter.\n\nTo compare GUS gene expression directed by the various promoter fragments during de-etiolation, 10-d-old etiolated tobacco seedlings were transferred to WL and the accumulation of GUS activities was followed for 72 h. Again, in spite of the variation in absolute GUS levels, the basic kinetics were identical for seedlings harboring the same construct (data not shown). However, Figure 5A demonstrates that the GUS accumulation kinetics for the different promoter fusions  ). Seedlings from six to nine independent primary transformants were analyzed individually. To synchronize germination, seeds received a 12-h RL treatment directly after sowing before transfer to darkness. B, Northern blots with spinach and tobacco RNA. For this experiment, seedlings were grown in the same way, and RNA was extracted at the times indicated. The low level of hybridization of the tobacco ATPC transcripts is probably due to the heterologous (spinach) probe. For the other filters, the respective homologous probes were used.\n\ndiffer. GUS levels under the control of the two PSAF promoter fragments -220 to +163 and -850 to +163 increase rapidly within 12 to 24 h after the onset of light and decrease thereafter, whereas those for the CAB-l, ATPC, and PC promoters increase steadily within the first 72 h of illumination, although to different extents.

Therefore, the response pattem observed for the PSAFIGUS gene fusions is not representative for either spinach or tobacco seedlings.\n\nNo significant stimulation of GUS gene expression by single light pulses operating through phytochrome were observed in transgenic tobacco seedlings harboring the spinach PC, PSAF, CAB, and ATPC promoters (data not shown). The only exception observed was the spinach FNR promoter, which did respond to a single RL pulse (Oelmiiller et al., 1993).\n\nTaking advantage of the availability of homologous cDNA probes for the spinach and tobacco PC genes, phytochromecontrolled expression of these genes was analyzed in N. plumbaginifolia and compared with that in spinach. Both species contain only a single copy of the PC gene per haploid genome (Bichler and Herrmann, 1990;Lübberstedt et al., 1994). The transcript levels in spinach increase 2-to 3-fold after a saturating RL pulse, and the effect is fully reversible by a subsequently given far-red light pulse (Table 11). In contrast, no, or no significant, stimulation was observed for the N. plumbaginifolia PC transcript level. Seedlings from Table II. Steady-state mRNA levels in the po/y(A)+ RNA fraction from J0-d-old spinach and N. plumbaginifolia seedlings Etiolated seedlings received either no light (D), a 5-min RL (RL) or far-RL (far-RL) pulse, or a RL pulse followed by a far-RL pulse (RL/far-RL) 12 h before harvest. Hybridization was performed with a PC cDNA from spinach or tobacco (N. tabacum) or the bacterial CUS gene probe (transformants 1, 2, and 3). RNA was isolated from the offspring of three independent primary transformants harboring the -1 126 to +60-bp PC promoter or from spinach seedlings. For hybridization with the tobacco PC gene, RNA from the transgenic material was Dooled.\n\nRelative mRNA\n\nTreatment Spinach (PC) D RL Far-RL RL/far-RL RL Far-RL RL/far-RL Transformant 1 (CUS) D RL Far-RL R L/far-R L RL Far-RL R L/far-R L RL Far-RL R L/far-R L N. plumbaginifolia (PC) D Transformant 2 (GUS) D Transformant 3 (GUS) D cpm 87 289 90 98 198 255 22 1 21 1 56 43 65 61 31 1 302 298 312 235 229 234 219\n\nthree independent primary N. plumbaginifolia transformants harboring the -1126-to +60-bp spinach PC promoter fused to a GUS gene also fail to respond to an RL pulse (Table 11). Identical results were obtained with N. tabacum seedlings: neither the trans-gene nor the endogenous PC transcript level responded to light pulses operating through phytochrome (data not shown). Kinetic studies confirmed that the lack of the phytochrome response is not caused by different accumulation kinetics of the GUS and PC messages (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the response of the trans-gene to a single light pulse activating the phytochrome system is different from that in spinach but normal in comparison to the regulation in N. plumbaginifolia and N. tabacum (see \"Discussion\").\n\nThe aim of the present study was to compare the quantitative and qualitative (light regulated) expression of the GUS reporter gene under the control of different upstream regions from nuclear genes for plastid proteins from spinach. The results demonstrate that these regions direct a gene-specific and unique response pattern to the GUS gene, which can also be different from the regulation of the endogenous genes in spinach and tobacco. This could imply that (a) not a11 regulatory elements are located within the promoter fragments or that (b) cis-regulatory elements that are probably essential for promoter function in spinach respond differently to tobacco regulatory signals or that (c) posttranscriptional mechanisms operate in concert with transcriptional mechanisms to synchronize the mRNA accumulation for plastid proteins. Examples for a11 three explanations have been reported in the literature.\n\nThat not a11 regulatory elements are located within promoter fragments is shown by the fact that various animal and plant genes contain nucleotide sequences located downstream of the transcription unit that act as enhancer elements and determine quantitative expression (Choi and Engel, 1986;Owen and Kuhn, 1987;Fischer and Maniatis, 1986;Bodine and Ley, 1987;Callis et al., 1987;Sanchez-Serrano et al., 1987;Thornberg et al., 1987;Trainor et al., 1987;Dean et al., 1989aDean et al., , 1989b;;Dietrich et al., 1992). These can include light-responsive elements (Gallo-Meagher et al., 1992). In addition, introns have been shown to increase the transcription of genes (Callis et al., 1987;Brinster et al., 1988). Similarly, a far-upstream promoter element has been identified that modulates the quantitative expression of the tomato RBCS-3A gene in a developmentally regulated manner (Ueda et al., 1989). Therefore, it is conceivable that the different expression levels of the chimeric gene fusions in transgenic tobacco arise because regulatory elements determining quantitative and/or the qualitative expression are not located within the promoter fragment used.\n\nAn example of a cis-regulatory element that responds differently in different species is provided by Sun et al. (1992), who have shown that the Arabidopsis CAB140 gene contains a sequence that is identical with the GT-1 box IIbinding site in the pea RBCS promoter but is not involved in the expression of the Arabidopsis gene. Also, the Fed-1 gene from pea exhibits different light responses in pea and tobacco (Gallo-Meagher et al., 1992) because not only promoter sequences but also interna1 regulatory elements control the expression of the truns-gene in tobacco. Elements with slight similarity to box I1 and 111 of the pea RBCS-3A promoter are also found within the spinach ATPD promoter, but they are located in regions that do not appear to contribute to light responsiveness (Bichler and Herrmann, 1990). Comparably, Luan and Bogorad (1992) have shown that a rice CAB gene promoter contains different cis-acting sequences that regulate expression in dicots and monocots. An octamer repeat that lies within the -269-to -170-bp promoter region is essential for photoregulated expression of the chimeric GUS gene in leaf cells of maize and rice but is not required for expression in illuminated tobacco leaves. Conversely, boxIII*-and Gbox-like sequences are necessary for high levels of expression in tobacco leaves but not in monocots. These observations can have, in part, a phylogenetic explanation. The spinach ATPC and ATPD genes, which have probably been transferred independently from the organelle chromosome to the nucleus (Herrmann et al., 1991;Pancic and Strotmann, 1993), have acquired cis elements that respond to the light-induced signal pathways in both spinach and tobacco (Fig. 3), but these elements could otherwise be so divergent that the GUS activities directed by their promoter regions differ by more than 1 order of magnitude (Fig. 1).\n\nMost evidence for light-regulated posttranscriptional controls has been deduced from discrepancies between in vitro (run-on) transcription and in vivo mRNA levels, which, for instance, have been reported for the oat phytochrome (Colbert, 1988) and the oat Pchlide-oxidoreductase (Mosinger et al., 1988). The mechanisms and control steps are unknown. However, differences in the mRNA abundance reported for various members of the RBCS and CAB gene families (Dean et al., 1985(Dean et al., , 1987) ) seem to be caused predominantly by transcriptional effects (Dean et al., 1989a(Dean et al., , 1989b) ) rather than posttranscriptional events.\n\nAlthough various short promoter regions have been identified that are capable of confemng light-regulated GUS gene expression to heterologous minimal promoters and a growing number of regulatory proteins that specifically interact with upstream regions of light-regulated genes have been identified, their mode of interaction with the light-dependent signal transduction pathway is not yet understood (see below). In addition, the expression of light-regulated genes can be modulated by more than one wavelength (Tobin and Silverthome, 1985;Marrs and Kaufman, 1989;Oelmüller et al., 1989;Oelmüller and Kendrick, 1991). The different light responses are mediated through distinct photoreceptors. This raises the basic question of whether genes that respond differently to different wavelengths operate with distinct cis elements or whether the signal transduction pathways converge to act on the same regulatory sequence. Fluhr and Chua (1986) have shown that 0.4-kb RBCS-3A and 2.0-kb RBCS-3C upstream regions are sufficient for phytochrome response and BL induction in transgenic petunia plants. In a series of 5' promoter deletions from the spinach PSAF and PC genes in tobacco, changes in sensitivity to RL and BL were observed (Figs. 2 and 3), indicating that these promoters contain regions with different responses to the BLand RL-dependent signal transduction pa thway(s) even within short promoter segments. Of course, this does not necessarily imply that such elements are exclusively sensitive to either RL or to BL. Furthermore, since 5' deletioris from different promoters respond differently to RL and BL (cf. PC and PSAF in Figs. 2 and 3), the arrangement of these ellements seems to be promoter specific. As expected, WL, which activates both photosystems, operates like RL in the cases of the PSAF and FNR promoters and like I5L in case of the PC promoter.\n\nAn additional complexity derives from the observation that not only the light quality but also the intensity seems to be an important parameter. For instance, under the chosen light conditions (5 W m-'), no significant BL response was detectable in seedlings transformed with the FNR promoter fragments, whereas the same BL intensity suffices to direct GUS gene expression under the control of other chimeric gene fusions (Fig. 2). However, GUS activity under the control of the FNR promoter fragments can be induced by higher BL intensities (data not shown). Therefore, the effectiveness of RL and BL in inducing GUS gene expression is dependent on the light intensity, and this dependency can be promoter specific.\n\nTable I1 and Figure 2 demonstrate that a11 trans-genes in 10-d-old etiolated tobacco seedlings fail to respond to light pulses but are induced after transfer of the seedlinp to WL. This is corrtparable to the regulation of the endogenous genes in tobacco but different from that in spinach, for which a response to a single light pulse is detectable. The spinach promoters in transgenic plants seem to respond normally to tobacco regulatory pathways. Since endogenous tobacco genes (Wehmeyer et al., 1990;Palomares et al., 1991), as well as chimeric GUS gene fusions in tobacco (Oelmüller et al., 1993), can be activated by RL pulses in etiolated tobacco seedlings, it remains to be determined why the promoter constructs analyzed in this study fail to respond to mch light pulses.\n\nThe different accumulation kinetics after transfer of etiolated transgenic tobacco seedlings to WL does nclt always reflect the situation in either donor or host plant. This points to the limitation of this approach and to the mechanisms that coordinate the expression of these genes in spinach. During evolution, the interaction between quite different cis elements caused by an independent transfer of originally organelleencoded genes to the nucleus and conserved signal pathways must have been optimized, probably separately for each promoter (cf. Wedel et al., 1992). This could explain, at least in part, why each promoter functions optimally in its environment but responds differently, although not necessarily qualitatively differently, to regulatory pathways from other organisms. Deciphering the adaptation of regulatory sequences (and of sequences for import of the cytosol-synthesized proteins into the organelle; Wedel et al., 1992, Cai et al., 1993) to light-dependent signal pathways as well as of processes that led to controlled/coordinated expression of nuclear genes and of their plastid partner genes represents one of the principal challenges of modem cell biology.\n\nAmong the nine spinach promoters studied so far, only the RBCS-1 promoter contains a fully conserved G-box palindrome, 5'-CACGTG-3'. Salinas et al. (1992) have recently shown that a tetramer of the element 5'-GCCACGTGGC-3', which is sufficient for binding the tobacco transcription activator TAF-1 in vitro, confers relatively high levels of GUS gene expression to the 90-bp 355 RNA CaMV minimal promoter in roots. The same result has been obtained with a trimer of the a G-box sequence with flanking regions from the spinach RBCS-1 promoter (5'-TCCACGTGGT-3'). Furthermore, although the element is part of a light-responsive segment, alone it confers negative light regulation to the 355 RNA CaMV minimal promoter in cotyledons of developing tobacco seedlings (Fig. 2). This result, as well as the absence of this element in the promoters of other light-regulated genes from spinach, suggests that this palindrome is probably more involved in quantitative expression rather than as an essential component of light-induced signal transduction pathways.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.
