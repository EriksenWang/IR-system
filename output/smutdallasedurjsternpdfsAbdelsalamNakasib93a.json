    "abstract": "The Nakasib suture is a late Proterozoic (Pan-African) ophiolite-decorated structural belt in the central Red Sea Hills of the Sudan. It represents one of the sutures along which the island arc/back-arc terranes and continental microplates of the Arabian-Nubian Shield are welded together. The Nakasib suture separates the 900-850 Ma old Haya terrane in the south from the 830-720 Ma old Gebeit terrane to the north. Five thrust-bounded stratigraphical groups are identified across the suture. These are, from south to north, Arbaat volcanic group (c. 730 Ma rift-related volcanic rocks), Salatib group (early passive margin volcanic and sedimentary rocks), Meritri group (the lower part of which contains alluvial and submarine fans of an incipient ocean basin, while its upper part can be tentatively equated with a platform of clastic sedimentary and carbonate intercalations which mark the stage of mature ocean basin opening), Nakasib ophiolite, and Shalhout group (arc-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks). These are intruded by syn-tectonic and post-tectonic plutonic rocks.\nThe tectonic setting of the above lithological groups suggests that the early stage of the Nakasib suture development was marked by rifting of older crust, probably the Haya terrane, which culminated in development of a passive margin on the south margin of an oceanic basin prior to collapse into an ophiolite-decorated suture. This indicates that the Nakasib suture evolved through a complete Wilson cycle orogeny from rifting, through passive margin formation, to closure of the basin and suturing.\nThe Arabian-Nubian Shield of NE Africa (Fig.\n1\n) is an example of a late Proterozoic orogenic belt that formed by Phanerozoic-type plate tectonic processes\n(Kroner 1984)\n. Geological work on the Shield emerges in two end-member tectonic models. (1) Accretion of intra-oceanic island arc and back-arc basin complexes (",
    "full_text": "The presence of ophiolite fragments along the Nakasib suture was first noted by Embleton et al. (1984) in the NE part of the belt (Fig. 2) whilst Kroner et al. (1987) identified another ophiolite complex occupying Jebel Tohado (Fig. 2). Almond & Ahmed (1987) reported another ophiolite occurrence at Jebel Igariri (Fig. 2). These ophiolite fragments define a NE-trending belt extending from north of Port Sudan in the NE to the Ariab area in the SW. There is general acceptance that this belt represents a suture separating two terranes (e.g. Vail 1983Vail , 1985;;Embleton et al. 1984;Kroner et al. 1987;Almond & Ahmed 1987;Almond et al. 1989). The terrane to the north was named the Gebeit terrane and that to the south the Haya terrane by Kroner et al. (1987). The Nakasib suture is offset by the younger, N-to NNW-trending Oko shear zone (Fig. 2). This offset is estimated to be about 30 km in a sinistral sense (Almond & Ahmed 1987). The Nakasib suture is thought to continue into Arabia as the Bir Umq suture (Vail 1983(Vail , 1985;;Embleton et al. 1984;Camp 1984;Stoeser & Camp 1985;Kroner et al. 1987;Almond & Ahmed 1987;Pallister et al. 1988;Almond et al. 1989). Almond & Ahmed (1987) suggested that the Nakasib suture evolved in two main stages. The first stage was subduction-related and caused ophiolite emplacement along an oceanic suture. The second stage was collision-related and resulted in shearing of the ophiolites within broad mylonite bands.\n\nThe region to the south of the Nakasib suture is occupied by the Haya terrane (Fig. 1). This NE-trending volcanosedimentary belt includes arc-related volcanic rocks (Kroner et al. 1987). The cdntral part of the Haya terrane is occupied by intensely folded high-grade rocks which include paragneisses and quartzites (I. M. Shaddad, pers. comm., 1990). The above assemblage was intruded by syn-tectonic granitoids of arc affinity (Klemenic & Poole 1988). Kroner et al. (1991) obtained U/Pb zircon ages of 830-870 Ma from several plutons in the Haya terrane. This led Kroner et al.\n\nThe Nakasib suture is defined by NE-trending beds of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, some of which can be traced along the entire length of the suture. The original lithologies and primary structures of these rocks are generally well preserved in spite of a pervasive low-grade greenschist facies metamorphism. The stratigraphical divisions presented below are based on four main traverses along Khors Arbaat, Meritri, Youdib and across the western extension of the Nakasib suture west of the Oko shear zone (Fig. 2). Other short traverses include Khors Hasheit, Adenaiab, Yas, Samadi, Salatib, Tendily and Igariri (Fig.\n\nOur work indicates that the stratigraphy of the Nakasib suture can be divided into five groups and a suite of intrusive rocks (Figs 2 and 3). The five groups, the focus of this paper, are separated by thrusts. The group names are new. This stratigraphy is informal because structural complications make it impossible to know the original relations between units preserved in the nappes. Only the Arbaat volcanic group is believed to be autochthonous and is the northern margin of the Haya terrane. Thrust contacts separating these groups are sometimes very steep, due to folding by younger NE-trending, upright and horizontal folds (Abdelsalam & Stern, in prep.; Fig. 2).\n\nAye et al. (1987) divided the rocks along the Nakasib suture into three broad assemblages. (1) The Onib-Oshib ultramafic complex, which comprises the ophiolite belts of the Nakasib suture. (2) The Ariab series, which comprises volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and corresponds to our Salatib, Meritri and Shalhout groups. (3) The Awat series, which includes post-tectonic volcanic rocks. Our work indicates that this series is part of the Arbaat volcanic group as will be discussed below.\n\nIn the following sections we describe the major lithostratigraphic components of the Nakasib suture beginning with the Arbaat volcanic group and progressing north and generally up section.\n\n(1991) to suggest that the Haya terrane is the extension of the 900-850 Ma old Asir terrane of Arabia (Fig. 1).\n\nThe Gebeit terrane comprises arc-related low-grade volcano-sedimentary sequences and syn-tectonic igneous complexes which occupy the area to the north of the Nakasib suture (Vail et al. 1984; Klemenic 1985; Klemenic et  al. 1985). Whole rock Rb/Sr isochron ages around 720 Ma have been reported for volcanic and plutonic rocks from the terrane (Fitches et al. 1983; Klemenic 1985; Reischmann  1986; Klemenic & Poole 1988; Almond et al. 1989). However, older ages of about 830 Ma were obtained for other volcanic rocks using Sm-Nd dating methods (Reischmann 1986). This led Kroner et al. (1987) to suggest that the Gebeit terrane constitutes part of the 700-850 Ma old Hijaz terrane (Stoeser & Camp 1985).\n\nAlmond et al. (1989) attempted to bracket the age of deformation along the Nakasib suture. They obtained a whole rock Rb-Sr isochron age of 6971+ 15Ma for a syn-tectonic granite in the SW part of the suture (the Shalhout granite), and 552 + 18 Ma for post-tectonic granite in the NE part (the Arbaat granite; Fig. 2). They concluded that the Nakasib suture formed prior to 700 Ma ago which is in general agreement with the time of arc accretion for the Arabian-Nubian Shield.\n\nThis group is predominantly composed of mafic metavolcanic rocks with subordinate felsic metavolcanic rocks and minor sandstone and limestone beds and reaches a minimum thickness of about 2 k m along Khor Salatib (Fig. 2). The base of the group has not been found. In the NE, this group crops out along Khor Arbaat and Khor Salatib and in the SW along Khor Samadi (Fig. 2). The Arbaat volcanic group at the junction between Khors Arbaat and Salatib (Fig. 2) comprises intercalations of basaltic andesite, rhyolite, intermediate tuff, sandstone, and conglomerate (Fig. 3). The sandstone beds show well-developed channel structures and convolute bedding. Pillow structures were observed in some of the metabasalts. The presence of these pillowed basalts indicate a subaqueous environment of eruption.\n\nThe contact between the Arbaat group and the Salatib group is defined by a NE-trending tectonic melange (Fig. 2), about 1 km thick. The melange comprises blocks of Arbaat volcanic rocks up to 8 m across which are enclosed in a sheared carbonate and clastic sedimentary matrix from the Salatib group (Fig. 4).\n\nOne suite of five samples from Khor Salatib and another suite of six samples from the Khor Satem area (Fig. 2) were / J BE AXIAL TRACES OF MAJOR FOLDS STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS 0 THRUSTS (UNCERTAIN) I THRUSTS POST-TECTONIC GRANITES SYN-TECTONIC GRANITES SHALHOUT GROUP NAKASIB OPHIOLITES MERITRI GROUP SALATIB GROUP 20 lO I AREA OF FIGURE 11 AREA OF FIGURE 13[F A~;H'_~ I 40 km ~ \" ao I ARBAAT VOLCANICS BELYAY OPH OPH SHEAR~ TENDILY P S,a,~ou, v.ag. .~ ! :. i C\" SHALHoU'r O~.;d ~ ~ HANTOULY P,:!!iii i IGARIRI OPH MERITRI OPH OLIG SYNFORM :: ~ ':;,'2 A AA LUGG~' G BB ~ ....... :~\" °o .... 19 N :÷.÷. ~**( ÷*~*** AREA OF FIGURE 10 i SHALHOUT ANTIFORM LUGGAG SYNFORM UT OPH ~IGARIRI OPH LUGGAG P ~//!/ SHALHO B BB Fig. 2.

Methods and standards of analysis follow those outlined by Stern et al. (1991). The analytical results are listed in Table 1 and are presented in Fig. 5. Samples from Khor Salatib gave an errorchron age of 722 + 59 Ma. The samples from Khor Satem gave an errorchron age of 744 + 137 Ma.\n\nWhen data points from both localities were plotted together an errorchron age of 722+47Ma is obtained. Initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from both localities are similar and range between 0.70265 and 0.70260 (Fig. 5).\n\nAlthough the above results are errorchron ages, they indicate the following:\n\n(1) The Arbaat volcanic rocks are pre-accretionary and were formed prior to around 730Ma ago and not post-tectonic extrusions. They cannot be related to the Asoteriba series or the Awat series as has been suggested (Aye et al. 1985). Kabesh (1962) suggested that the Awat volcanic rocks unconformably overlie the older volcanosedimentary rocks of the Red Sea Hills which were grouped as the Nafardieb series. Klemenic (1985) obtained a whole rock Rb-Sr age of 671 + 18 Ma from the similar Homogar volcanic rocks in the northern part of the Red Sea Hills. The low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the Arbaat volcanic rocks (0.70265-0.70260) compared to the Homogar volcanic rocks (0.7034) further supports the distinction between the two volcanic suites.\n\n(2) The Arbaat volcanic rocks represent a continuous belt extending from the NE part of the Nakasib suture, through its central part at the vicinity of the Oko shear zone and possibly up to the SW part of the suture (Fig. 2). This is indicated by the similar ages and initial 87Sr/a6Sr ratios of volcanic rocks from Khor Salatib at the NE part of the suture and Khor Satem to the SW (Fig. 5).\n\nThe tectonic setting of the Arbaat volcanic rocks, deduced from geochemical data, is of special interest with respect to the early evolution of the Nakasib suture. The results of chemical analysis for 23 samples from them are listed in Table 2. Methods and standards of analysis are outlined in the caption to Fig. 6. Geochemical analyses for 17 other samples obtained by Reischmann (1986) are also considered here. Locations of geochemical data are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThe samples under consideration include 18 basalts, five basaltic andesites, nine andesites, three rhyolites, three trachyandesites, one dacite, and one hawaiite (Fig. 6a). All of the samples analysed preserve original igneous textures. Alteration is slight and includes development of chlorite and epidote after the mafic minerals and limited breakdown of Ca-plagioclase into sericite and calcite. All of the samples, with the exception of 6, plot in the tholeiitic field of the FeO*/MgO-SiO2 diagram (Fig. 6b). Tectonic discriminant diagrams are employed for the Arbaat volcanic rocks (Figs 7 & 8). In the TiO2-Zr and Z r / Y -Z r diagrams (Pearce 1980); they concentrate in the within-plate field (Fig. 7a and b), and most of them have low Nb concentrations (1.0-10.4 ppm). This is reflected in the concentration of data points in the volcanic arc magma field in the Nb-SiO2 diagram (Fig. 8; Pearce & Gale 1977). The low Nb concentration (generally regarded as indicating arc setting) of the Arbaat volcanic rocks is not easy to reconcile with a continental rift tectonic setting. Low concentrations of Nb are also observed from rift basalts  Fig. 6. Plot of major element data from the Arbaat volcanic rocks.\n\nThe major element analysis of our 23 samples was carried out by XRF at the University of Oklahoma using fused disks. Trace element concentrations were obtained by XRF at the same laboratory using pressed pellets.

The Arbaat volcanic rocks show remarkable geochemical similarities to these basalts (Fig. 9a). Moreover, the same geochemical pattern of Nb depletion was observed from some of post-tectonic within-plate Pan-African dykes of south Sinai (Friz-Topfer 1991) and the c. 710 Ma old Shadli rift volcanic rocks of the south Eastern Desert of Egypt (Stern et al. 1991;Fig. 9b). This low-Nb subductional geochemical signature which appears in some rift tholeiites may indicate that the subcontinental lithosphere through which these basalts erupted preserved the signature of former subduction processes (Thompson et al. 1983). The chemical composition of the lithosphere which underlies the Arbaat volcanic rocks is not known. However, it is likely that this lithosphere evolved in the subductional processes which resulted in the formation of the Haya arc terrane (Kroner et al. 1987, Kroner et al. 1991). As a consequence, the arc signature represented by low Nb concentration may have been inherited by the Arbaat volcanic rocks.\n\nThis group is made up of intercalated clastic sediments, carbonate, rhyolite and felsic tuff.

Fold geometry and primary structures (mainly graded bedding and cross bedding) suggest that the general younging direction of the group is from SW to NE.\n\nIn the southwest, the Salatib group occupies a major antiform-synform which is defined here as the Samadi structure (Fig. 10). The 1.2 km thick succession comprises mainly lithic wacke, microconglomerate and intraformational conglomerate intercalated with thin felsic to intermediate tufts and limestone beds (Fig. 10). In the central part of the Nakasib suture the group comprises intercalations of rhyolite, conglomerate, lithic wacke, mudstone, ignimbrite, felsic volcanics and welded tuff. In the northeast part of the Nakasib suture, the Salatib group occupies the NE-trending Salatib antiform (Fig. 11). The core of this antiform is dominated by lithic wacke with minor intercalations of pebbly lithic wacke and microconglomerate. The limbs of the Salatib antiform are defined by thin and well bedded intercalated microconglomerate, purple sandstone, limestone, rhyolite, quartzite and marl.\n\nThis group is made up of four formations. These are from oldest to youngest: conglomerate; lithic wacke; intercalated limestone, red sandstone and felsic tuff; and felsic volcanic rocks (Fig. 11). These are folded into the NE-trending Olig synform (Fig. 11).\n\nThe conglomerate occupies the core of the downwardfacing Olig synform (Fig. 11) and is made up of abundant polymict conglomerate intercalated with minor lithic wacke and limestone beds. It shows an apparent thickness of about 4km along Khor Meritri. Allowing for folding and thrusting, the original thickness in Khor Meritri is c. 2 km.\n\nThe polymict conglomerate is matrix supported. The matrix consists of lithic wacke and minor carbonate. The clasts comprise granite, granodiorite, diorite, rhyolite, ignimbrite and carbonate as well as a few clastic sedimentary clasts. Intermediate to felsic volcanic clasts dominate the SW extension of the unit, W of the Oko shear zone. In the NE, along Khor Meritri, plutonic clasts are most abundant and form about 50% of total clasts. Volcanic clasts are about 35%. Sedimentary clasts represent about 15%.\n\nThe lithic wacke unit occupies the limbs of the Olig synform (Fig. 11) with an original thickness of c. 2.5 km. It is made up of lithic wacke intercalated with minor felsic volcanic layers and limestone beds. Locally the lithic wacke grades into microconglomerate with dominant felsic volcanic fragments. Sedimentary structures include graded bedding (Fig. 12a), cross bedding (Fig. 12b), and channels. The channel structure and cross bedding indicate that the palaeocurrent direction was from SE to NW.\n\nThe intercalation of limestone, red sandstone, and felsic tufts outcrops only along Khor Meritri and Khor Milalab (Fig. 11), thinning out along strike. It occupies part of the south limb of the Olig synform where its upper boundary is partially truncated by the thrust which separates the Meritri group from the Salatib group (Fig. 11). The original thickness of the entire unit is estimated to be about 200 m along Khor Meritri.\n\nThe upper part of the Meritri group is dominated by felsic volcanic rocks and clastic sediments. These rocks crop out along Khor Yas (Fig. 2) where they occupy an antiform (Fig. 11) and reach a thickness of 600m. The clastic sediments occupy the stratigraphically lower position and are made up of thin intercalations of conglomerates, sandstones, and minor limestone beds. The volcanic rocks are stratigraphically higher and are ,made up of tuffaceous volcanics, pyroclastics and rhyolites with well-developed flow banding.\n\nThis work provides five points which constrain interpretations of the depositional setting of the Salatib and Meritri groups. (1) The presence of cross bedding and channel structure indicate a subaerial depositional setting of possible proximal fluvial and alluvial fans and plains. (2) The palaeocurrent was from SE to NW as indicated by the cross bedding. (3) The large clast size and poor sorting of the conglomerates suggest a high energy depositional regime and support a possible fluvial depositional setting for the lower part of the Meritri group. (4) On the other hand, the presence of graded bedding suggests a deep water setting of possible submarine fans. (5) The rift tectonic setting of the Arbaat volcanic rocks, together with the above depositional characteristics suggest that the Meritti group was deposited on a steep slope of a rifted block, possibly the northern margin of the Haya terrane. Rift volcanic rocks are generally followed and accompanied by alluvial fan and/or submarine fans deposits (Crossely 1979). Hence, the Salatib group possibly represents fan deposits accumulated above the Arbaat rift volcanic rocks but it is not yet possible to decide whether the Salatib group represent alluvial fans or submarine fans. The oldest part of the Meritri group shows gross similarities to submarine fans which are characterized by accumulation of clastic sediments under progressively deeper water conditions that accompany opening of incipient ocean basins (Miall 1990). The basal lithofacies of submarine fans is often characterized by development of chaotic deposits of exotic clasts and contorted and disrupted strata (Picketing et al. 1986). This is very similar to the polymict conglomerate of the Meritri group. Moreover, the Meritri conglomerates resemble those of Jurassic-Cretaceous fan-deltas to submarine fans which were deposited along scraps in tilted blocks of east Greenland (Surlyk 1984). Along the faulted blocks, fan-deltas and submarine fan conglomerates are followed by dominant deposition of sands of submarine distal fans (Picketing et al. 1986; Surlyk 1987), exemplified here by the lithic wackes of the Meritti group. In this way, the Salatib and Meritri groups may represent distal and proximal sedimentary deposits.\n\nThis group comprises mafic and ultramafic rocks which, although dismembered, show most of the characteristics of ophiolites. The rocks occur as fragments and lenses in two parallel belts which outline a folded nappe. This folded thrust geometry is defined by the Shalhout antiform in the SW part of the Nakasib suture (Fig. 2). In the N limb of the fold, the thrust plane is defined by a narrow (less than 5 m thick) NW-dipping (45 °) talc and serpentinite band. The thrust separates structurally lower dacitic volcanics of the Shalhout group from gabbros and pyroxenites of the\n\n.-,< , , \". \". \".-:-:.:.:.:.:-:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:-:.:-\" .\" o o. a * ','i -~.'.

The discordant trend is due to deflection by the Oko shear zone (Fig. 2). The Arbaat ophiolite (Fig. 13) contains sheared fragments of serpentinite melange, isotropic gabbro, pillowed basalt, jasper and chert. The Meritri ophiolite is composed of talc schist and tectonic melange which contains fragments of ultramafic rocks enclosed in a clastic sedimentary matrix. Other lithologies include pyroxenite, layered gabbro, and basalt. The Belyay ophiolite is mainly ultramafic melange in which partly serpentinized pyroxenite and magnesite blocks are enclosed in a matrix of sheared serpentinite and talc (Fig. 14). The Youdib ophiolite is a large lens of sheared gabbro. The Shalhout ophiolite comprises serpentinite and talc which enclose large lenses of pyroxenite, isotropic gabbro and basalt. These lithologies are intercalated with elastic sedimentary and intermediate volcanic rocks of the Shalhout group. The Igariri ophiolite is made up of sheared serpentinite and gabbro separated by elastic sediments and marble beds.\n\nLimited geochemical data from the pillowed basalts of the Arbaat and Shalhout ophiolites (Fig. 2) suggests that these basalts are tholeiitic (Fig. 6b). These basalts plot in the MORB field of the TiO2-Zr and Z r / Y -Z r tectonic discriminant diagrams (Fig. 7; Pearce 1980). ophiolite which occupy the structurally higher position. On the southern limb of the Shalhout antiform, the foliation along the thrust dips steeply to moderately to the SE. In the NE part of the Nakasib suture, a similar SE-dipping thrust plane that is defined by talc schist is recorded from the ophiolite along Khor Meritri.\n\nSix ophiolite occurrences are recorded along the Nakasib suture: Arbaat, Meritri, Balyay, Youdib, Shalhout and Igariri (Fig. 2). A major ophiolite occurrence which is\n\nThis group occupies the area between the two belts of the Nakasib ophiolites and that to the NW of it (Fig. 2). It was named the Yas volcanic group in the NE-part of the Nakasib suture (Abdelsalam & Stern 1991). We think that the name Shalhout group is more suitable because the group contains clastic sedimentary rocks as well as volcanic rocks, and the group is best exposed around Shalhout village (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Shalhout group comprises felsic and intermediate volcanic rocks and fine-grained wackes. Other lithologies include ignimbrite and felsic tufts. In the NE-part of the Nakasib suture, along Khor Adenaiab, the felsic tufts of the Shalhout group are in thrust contact with the conglomerates of the Meritri group (Fig. 2). Along Khor Meritri, this thrust contact is decorated by the Meritri ophiolite. Thrust planes in both localities are NW-verging with dips of 7 ° to 10 ° along Khor Meritri and 45 ° to 50 ° along Khor Adenaiab. Along Khor Adenaiab two distinct units can be observed. The lower unit is made up of fine grained turbidites  containing graded bedding and cross bedding. The upper unit comprises thin (less than 1 m thick) layers of felsic tufts and ignimbrite. Limited geochemical data from the Shalhout volcanic rocks (Abdelsalam & Stern unpublished data) suggest that these rocks are arc-related. This in turn suggests that the Shalhout group may constitute the southernmost extent of the arc volcanic field of the Gebeit terrane (Fitches et al.  1983; Vail et al. 1984; El Nadi 1984; Klemenic 1985;  Klemenic et al. 1985; Reischmann 1986).\n\nThe stratigraphicai groups described above are intruded by various plutonic rocks ranging from gabbro to granite. These can be divided into syn-tectonic and post-tectonic intrusions depending on the presence or absence of planar and linear fabrics. The syn-tectonic intrusions in the SW-part of the suture are mainly granites to adamellites (e.g. the Shalhout pluton and the Luggag pluton (Fig. 2). They occur as small intrusions of about 10 km average diameter. The Shalhout granite occupies the core of the Shalhout antiform whereas the Luggag pluton occupies the core of the Olig-Luggag synform (Fig. 2). Both plutons contain NE-to E-trending uptight foliation which corresponds to the axial planar cleavage of the late folds. Moreover, the two plutons show N-to NNW-trending upright foliations and fractures which is parallel to the planar fabric developed during the formation of the Oko shear zone. Almond et al. (1989) obtained a whole rock Rb-Sr isochron age of 697 + 15 Ma from the Shalhout pluton.\n\nThe syn-tectonic 'granites' in the NE-part of the Nakasib suture are mainly gabbro to diorite (e.g. the Arbaat pluton and the Youdib pluton; Fig. 2). The Arbaat pluton contains local and faint NE-trending upright foliation. A small dioritic pluton which outcrops at the junction between Khor Meritri and Khor Salatib (Fig. 2) contains NW-dipping foliation and mylonite bands which were developed during the early stage of the Nakasib suture evolution. At the north part of Khor Meritri, north of the Meritri ophiolite, a small, NE-elongated body (less than 2 km wide) of a syn-tectonic granodiorite is stretched parallel to the Meritri ophiolite (Figs 2 and 11). We examined the contact between this body and the Meritri ophiolite and interpreted it as being a thrust for the following reasons: (1) the contact is straight; (2) the dip of the contact is shallow (27°SE); (3) no chilled margin is observed in the pluton; (4) no thermal metamorphic effect is observed in the ophiolite next to the pluton.\n\nThe post-tectonic intrusions are mainly granites which are free of any planar fabric related to the Nakasib deformation. One of these granites in the NE part of the Nakasib suture (named the Arbaat pluton by Almond  1980). These volcanic rocks are followed by alluvial fan deposition and submarine fans intercalated with rift volcanic rocks (Crossley 1979). This rifting stage of a passive margin development is well preserved along the Nakasib suture in the form of the Arbaat group and possibly the Salatib group where extensive intercalations of elastic sediments and felsic volcanic rocks are present.\n\nThe stage of incipient or youthful ocean is characterized by accumulation of elastic sediments under progressively deeper water conditions in the form of submarine fans and other turbidite systems (Miall 1990; Picketing et al. 1986). Attempting to identify lithofacies in the Meritri group similar to those of submarine fans is beyond the scope of this work, but units of the lower part of the Meritri group are possible candidates.\n\nDuring the mature ocean stage, the sequences deposited during the rift and incipient ocean stages are covered by a wedge of carbonate and/or elastic sediments which show evidence of lateral progradation as well as vertical upbuilding. The intercalations of clastic and carbonate sediments of the youngest part of the Meritri group resemble the near-shore/marginal deposits of a mature ocean basin.\n\nThe presence of c. 730 Ma old Arbaat rift volcanic rocks indicate that the early stage in development of the Nakasib suture was dominated by an extensional tectonic regime which resulted in the formation of an oceanic basin. These rift volcanic rocks, together with possible passive margin deposits, suggest that the Nakasib suture evolved through a complete Wilson cycle orogeny. Figure 15 illustrates the tectonic evolution of the Nakasib suture prior to the late deformational event which resulted in folding of the nappes. This later structural complication will be discussed in Abdelsalam & Stern (in prep.).\n\nFig. 5\n\n. The geochronology of the Arbaat volcanic rocks.
