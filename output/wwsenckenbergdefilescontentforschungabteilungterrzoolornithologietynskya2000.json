    "abstract": "Tynskya eocaena n. gen. n. sp. is described from Lower Eocene deposits of the Green River Formation (Wyoming, USA). The species is characterized by a distinctive morphology of the tarsometatarsus. Although Tynskya eocaena resembles the Lower and Middle Eocene Pseudasturidae MAVR 1998 and some recent strigiform and falconiform birds in several aspects, it has not been possible to find derived characters which convincingly support a classification of this species into one of the known higher avian taxa. Birds closely related to Tynskya eocaena have also been found in the Lower Eocene London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze (Essex, England) and give a further example of the great similarity between the early Eocene avifauna of North America and Europe.",
    "full_text": "While the mid-Tertiary (i. e. Oligocene and Miocene) avifauna in general is of rather modern aspect, birds from the Lower and Middle Eocene often show a mosaic distribution of characters typical for several avian \"families\" and \"orders\". Just because of their age it is likely that many of these bird ate in sister group relationship to more than one higher extant taxon, anda phylogenetic assignment is thus very difficult given the poor knowledge on the interrelationships of the recent birds. This is especially true for the new taxon from the Lower Eocene of North America and England which is described in this study. *) Special issue of Senckenbergiana lethaea, edited by GERHARD STORCH ~ 91 KARSTEN WEDDIGE Address of the author: Dr. GERALD MAYR, Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg, Sektion Ornithologie, Senckenberganlage 25; D-60325 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. -E-mail: gmayr@sng.uni-frankfurt.de\n\nThe anatomical terminology follows BAUMEL & WITMER (1993). The dimensions represent the maximum length of the bone along its longitudinal axis, except for the claws where the distance between the tuberculum extensorium and the apex phalangis has been measured.\n\nThe following abbreviations have been used to indicate collections in which the specimens are deposited: BSP = Bayerische Staatssammlung ffª Pal/iontologie und Historische Geologie (Mª Germany), WN = Collection M.

E t y m o 1 o g y : The genus has been named after the type locality (\"Tynsky Quarry\"). Tynskya n. gen. is feminine in gender. D i a g n o s i s : Beak short and robust and, as far as it can be compare& similar to that of some falconiform birds (e. g. Accipiter nisus); humerus roughly corresponding in proportions to that of Upupa epops (Upupidae) but with shorter and more rounded crista deltopectoralis; carpometacarpus with straight os metacarpale minus and large trochlea carpalis; legs long (tibiotarsus is longest limb element). Tarsometatarsus robust, hall as long as tibiotarsus and very distinctive: shaft of about equal width over most of its length; hypotarsus similar to that of the Strigiformes and some Falconiformes (Accipitridae and Falconidae) in that crista medialis hypotarsi larger than crista lateralis hypotarsi and both cristae bordering a wide sulcus; crista medialis hypotarsi passing into a crista medianoplantaris; foramen vasculare distale small (WN 96939); fossa metatarsi I large and situated at the beginning of the distal third of the tarsometatarsus; trochleae metatarsorum arranged on a curve; trochlea metatarsi II small; trochlea metatarsi III very broad and reaching farther distally than the other trochleae metatarsorum; trochlea metatarsi IV similar to that of turacos (Musophagidae) and reaching less far distally than trochlea metatarsi II; no well-developed Sehnenhalter (terminology after SXElNBACnER 1935) present. Processus articularis tarsometatarsalis of os metatarsale I long; toes long; claws with small tuberculum flexorium which is situated rather far distally. Differential diagnosis: Tynskya n. gen. differs from the -Pseudasturidae MAYR 1998 in: skull smaller in relative size; humerus stouter with larger proximal end; foramen vasculare distale (tarsometatarsus) smaller; trochlea metatarsi IV without well developed Sehnenhalter; processus articularis tarsometatarsalis of os metatarsale I longer. Strigiformes in: humerus stouter with larger proximal end and smaller crista bicipitalis; trochlea cartilaginis tibialis (tibiotarsus) without deep furrow; trochlea metatarsi II smaller and trochlea metatarsi III broader; trochlea metatarsi IV without well developed Sehnenhalter; proximal phalanges of the fourth toe longer. -Falconidae and Accipitridae in: crista bicipitalis of humerus smaller; crista deltopectoralis (humerus) more round-Tynskya eocaena n. sp.

H o l o t y p e : BSP 1997 I 6 -incomplete articulated skeleton deposited in the Bayerische Staatssammlung fª Palfiontologie und Historische Geologie, Mfinchen/Germany (text-fig. 1).\n\nTy p e l o c a I i t y : \"Tynsky Quarry\", Wyoming, USA.\n\nType horizon: UpperLowerEocene(FossilButteMemberof the Green River Formation).\n\nTentatively referred specimen: WN 96939 several isolated bones found associated in the Lower Eocene London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex/England (text-fig. 6). D i m e n s i o n s (in mm): Humerus: 36.6 (l). Ulna: 40.0 (1)/~39.4 (r). Carpometacarpus: 20.1 (1)/20.1 (r). Tibiotarsus: 42.0 (1). Tarsometatarsus: 21.6 (r). Pedal phalanges: II: -9.3; II3: 8.8; 114: ~6.9; IVI: 4.5; IV2: 4.1; IV3: 4.l; IV4: 7.3; IV5: 6.6. D i a g n o s i s : Single named species of the genus, therefore the diagnosis is the same as for the genus. In its size and in the relative length of the limb elements Tynskya eocaena n. sp. corresponds well with Otus scops (Strigiformes). R e m a r k s: The skeleton is exposed from its dorsal side. Although it looks quite complete at first sight, most parts of the cranium and the trunk (furcula, sternum, pelvis, proximal end of right tibiotarsus) are not preserved and the slab has been painted in these areas. The shaft of the right humerus is fractured which might have caused the death of the bird. It is short (measuring less than one third of the total length of the skull) and approximately as wide at its base as it is long. The culmen is curved, the dorsal bar of the os nasale is medio-laterally broad (wider than in strigiform birds). The narial openings ate more than half as long as the beak and appear to have been oval-shaped (their ventral margin is not visible). As far as comparable the upper jaw therefore most closely resembles that of accipitrid birds (e. g. Accipiter nisus), but neither the tip of the praemaxilla nor the crista tomialis are visible. A slender bar which can be seen on the left side of the skull most likely is the left epibranchiale & t h e hyobranchial apparatus (it appears to be too thin for the pterygoid). Several ossified tracheal rings are preserved.\n\nVe r t e b r a e : Most vertebrae have been lost and the few short cervical vertebrae which remain on the slab are too fragmentary to allow a detailed comparison.\n\nC o r a c o i d : Only the proximal end of the right coracoid is preserve& most of which is covered by the acromion of the scapula. The facies articularis clavicularis is well developed. The processus procoracoideus sectas to be short, but is not clearly visible. F u r c u I a : The original bony substance of the furcula has been lost and merely a U-shaped impression is preserved. An impression of the apophysis furculae cannot be seen and the scapus claviculae seems to have h a d a constant width. S c a p u I a : The moderately long and blunt acromion bears a small projection on its dorsal side. The blade of the scapula is not preserved. R i b s : Five stout sternal ribs can be counted, the most caudal being two times longer than the most cranial one; vertebral ribs are not preserved.\n\nH u m e r u s (text-fig. 3): The humerus has similar proportions like that of Upupa epops (Upupidae), but bears a shorter and more rounded crista deltopectoralis. Its shaft is only slightly curved, the proximal end of the bone is rather broad. The tuberculum dorsale is small. The crista deltopectoralis measures approximately t/5 of the entire length of the bone and is low and convex. The caput humeri is only slightly inflected towards the cranial side of the bone; a foramen pneumaticum is absent. The ectepicondylus of the distal end bears two distinct adjacent depressions. The sulcus scapulotricipitalis is shallow, but the sulcus humerotricipitalis appears to have been deeply excavated. The processus flexorius reaches less far distally than the condylus ventralis.\n\nThe blade of the phalanx proximalis digiti majoris is narrow and bears a shallow fossa ventralis. The distal end of the phalanx distalis digiti majoris is widened. Both the phalanx digiti alulae and the phalanx distalis digiti majoris bear a rudimentary claw which measures 1.7 mm and 0.6 mm respectively (a survey on the occurrence of vestigial claws in recent birds has been conducted by STEPHAN 1992). The phalanx digiti minoris is slender and small. Os carpi radiale and os carpi ulnare are similar to the corresponding bones of Otus scops. The latter is small with a rather narrow incisura metacarpalis, crus breve and crus longum have approximately the same length.\n\nT i b i o t a r s u s : The tibiotarsus is the longest limb bone and even exceeds the ulna in length. The cristae cnemiales appear to have been small. The trochlea cartilaginis tibialis is low and shallow. The fibula reaches 2/5 of the length of the tibiotarsus but might have been longer originally, since the distal end seems to be incomplete. T a r s o m e t a t a r s u s (text-fig. 5): Thetarsometatarsus of Tynskya measures slightly more than half the length of the tibiotarsus and is a distinctive bone. The shaft has nearly the same width over most of its length and only widens at its proximal and distal ends. The hypotarsus resembles that of the Strigiformes and some Falconiformes (Accipitridae and Falconidae): It exhibits a large crista medialis hypotarsi a n d a smaller crista lateralis hypotarsi (specimen WN 96939) which border a wide sulcus. The hypotarsus encloses no canal (WN 96939). The crista medialis hypotarsi passes into a crista medianoplantaris which runs along half the length of the tarsometatarsus. The fossa infracotylaris dorsalis is deep (WN 96939). The foramen vasculare distale is small (WN 96939). The fossa metatarsi I is large and situated rather high at the beginning of the distal third of the shaft. In distal view the trochleae metatarsorum are arranged on a curve. The trochlea metatarsi II is very small, compared to the broad trochlea metatarsi III. Both the trochlea metatarsi II and the trochlea metatarsi IV are shorter than the trochlea metatarsi III. The trochlea metatarsi IV reaches even less far distally than the trochlea metatarsi II and resembles the corresponding trochlea of turacos (Musophagidae) in that the articulation surface for the fourth toe directs somewhat laterally. Therefore Tynskya might have been able to spread the fourth toe in lateral direction. A well developed Sehnenhalter, however, seems to be absent (contrary to the Pseudasturidae MAYR 1998 and strigiform birds).\n\nTo e s: The toes are long, the third toe is the longest and exceeds the tarsometatarsus in length. The fourth toe is distinctly shorter and approximately as long as the tarsometatarsus. The three proximal phalanges of the fourth toe are shorter than the fourth phalanx, but notas abbreviated as in the Strigiformes and many Falconiformes; the second and third phalanges are slightly more abbreviated than the first one. The hallux (visible at the right foot) is of average length, its proximal phalanx measures almost half the length of the tarsometatarsus. In both size and shape, the moderately curved claws correspond well with those of Otus scops, the tuberculum flexorium is rather low and situated far distally. The os metatarsale I bears a long processus articularis tarsometatarsalis and is similar to the corresponding bone of turacos (Musophagidae).\n\nBirds closely related to Tynsl~a eocaena n. gen. n. sp. were also collected by M. DANIELS in the Lower Eocene London Clay ofWalton-on-the-Naze, Essex (text-fig. 6) and are listed as \"owls\" in FEDUCCIA (1996: tab. 4.1). They give a further example of the great similarity between the early Eocene avifauna of North America and Europe (see for example HOUDE 1988;MAYR 1998;MAYR & PETERS 1998). Similar birds have not been identified so far among the numerous bird skeletons found in the Middle Eocene of Messel (Hessen, Germany) which possibly indicates, that the genus Tynskya became extinct towards the end of the Lower Eocene.\n\nThe fact that the beak of Tynskya eocaena seems to resemble that of some falconiform birds, might suggest that this species also hada raptorial way of living. Yet, considerations concerning its diet remain very speculative, as long as the shape of the crista tomialis and the morphology of the mandible are unknown.\n\nIt has not been possible to find derived characters which convincingly support an assignment of T. eocaena to any of the recent or fossil higher avŸ taxa, but instead of creating a new monotypic \"family\" and thus moving the problem of classification merely to a higher systematic level, it seems to be more appropriate to leave Tynskya n. gen. incertae sedis concerning its higher systematic affinities.\n\nIn its overall morphology and in the relative length of the limb elements T. eocaena resembles the Lower and Middle Eocene Pseudasturidae MAYR 1998, which are represented in the Green-River-Formation by \"Primobucco\" olsoni FEDUC-CIA 8, 91 MARTIN 1976 (tab. 1). Due to preservation, however, most of the characters listed in the original diagnosis of this family are not visible in the type specimen of T. eocaena (e. g. the elongated processus supraorbitales, the marked de-\n\nTab. 1.

Contrary to T. eocaena all pseudasturid birds known so far exhibit a well developed Sehnenhalter and have thus been fully or at least facultatively zygodactyl (MAYR 1998). Moreover, these birds have a much more slender humerus than T. eocaena (see also differential diagnosis of Tynskya n. gen.).\n\nTynskya eocaena also shares features with strigiform and some falconiform birds (especially concerning the shape of the beak and the morphology of the hypotarsus). The mosaic distribution of strigiform and falconiform characters in this species and the Pseudasturidae could perhaps indicate, that Strigiformes and at least part of the Falconiformes are closer related than is obvious from most recent classifications. This (traditional) idea has recently been revived by CRACRAFT (1981CRACRAFT ( , 1988) ) who listed the structure of the hypotarsus and several other features in order to support a monophyly of the Strigiformes and part of the Falconiformes (Accipitridae, Falconidae, Pandionidae). Yet, although outgroup comparisons with the palaeognathous Tinamiformes and Lithornithiformes HOUDE 1988 suggest, that the hypotarsus of T. eocaena and that of strigiform and the above-mentioned falconiform birds is derived within neognathous birds, it requires an extensive phylogenetic analysis including many higher avian taxa to show that it virtually is synapomorphic. True owls already occur in Paleocene and Lower Eocene deposits of North America and Europe (WETMORE 1938;MARTIN & BLACK 1972;RICU & BOHASKA 1976;MOURER-CHAUVIR• 1994), but there is no certain record of falconiform birds of comparable age (the bones described by HARRISON & WALKER 1979and HARRlSON 1982, 1984 from the Lower Eocene of England are too fragmentary to allow correct identification)."
