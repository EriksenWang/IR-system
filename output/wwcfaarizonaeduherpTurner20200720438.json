Turner Tucson, Arizona, USA. dturner@theriver.com Sonoita Creek State Natural Area of southern Arizona lies in the \"sky island\" archipelago of southwestern North America, which is known for its rich biodiversity. Mountain ranges in the region contain unique biotic assemblages, with distributional edges, gaps, and outliers that lead to a variety of fascinating biogeographic questions (Warshall 1995). The valleys provide corridors between montane populations and allow extensions of distribution for lower-elevation species. Lowlands are generally the best-watered, most productive parts of the landscape, and have also been the most heavily affected by human use, both globally and locally.\n\nThe Sonoita Creek valley has been haphazardly visited by herpetologists for decades, but most collecting has been done along the main road, Highway 82, due to constraints of access to private property.\n\nThis inventory was a volunteer effort. The goals were to provide qualitative information about the herpetofauna of Sonoita Creek State Natural Area, particularly species presence, but also to provide information on species distribution and abundance.\n\nSonoita Creek State Natural Area (SCSNA) extends east along Sonoita Creek for 7 miles from its confluence with the Santa Cruz River about 8 miles north of Nogales, Arizona, and includes lands north from the creek up to 5 miles (Fig. 1). It is managed by the Arizona State Parks Department (ASP) for the benefit of its natural values. With the initial purchase in 1994, it was the first such natural area acquired with funds from the state lottery that were dedicated in the 1990 Heritage Initiative to protect \"parcels of land or water that contain examples of unique natural terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, rare species of plants and animals, or outstanding geologic or hydrologic features.\"\n\nThe Natural Area has been greatly expanded with adjacent land around Coal Mine Spring, purchased in 2005 and 2006 by Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD; also using Heritage Fund money) and US Fish and Wildlife Service but jointly managed by ASP. When the areas are considered together, the Natural Area comprises about 8,786 acres. It ranges in elevation from 3,440 ft at the downstream end up to 5,466 ft in the Grosvenor Hills.\n\nFor purposes of this study, I included SCSNA, the adjacent Patagonia Lake State Park, and out to one mile beyond the SCSNA boundaries.\n\nThe portion of SCSNA that receives most attention is the cottonwood/willow gallery forest along Sonoita Creek, along with associated mesquite bosques. Aside from the perennial flow in Sonoita Creek, the area includes intermittent stream reaches in Fresno and Coal Mine canyons, and the perennial Coal Mine Spring. The entire area drains into Sonoita Creek. The upland vegetation of SCSNA is primarily semidesert grassland, with small areas of oak savanna. A detailed flora of the original Natural Area, comprising 4,900 acres before the AGFD additions, found 525 native plant species and 36 exotic species (McLaughlin 2006). An abandoned railroad bed along the Sonoita Creek has been converted to a nonmotorized trail, and provides the primary access along the creek. Prior to acquisition by ASP, the area was used primarily for cattle grazing, and cattle remain a strong influence on the landscape. Other current uses include trespass off-road vehicle, horse, and foot travel along the creek bed and trail. Unlike many places near the U.S./Mexico border, illegal immigrant traffic did not appear to have a strong impact during summer 2006.\n\nTo determine which species had been previously recorded, I examined records from the University of Arizona herpetological collection for specimens collected in southern Santa Cruz County. I also examined the available unpublished literature for the vicinity (Powell et al. 2005, Swann 1996).\n\nIn the field, other volunteers, SCSNA staff, and I gathered data on presence, abundance and distribution of reptile and amphibian species using visual encounter surveys along the riparian zones and the uplands, and funnel trap arrays (the \"Kevin Baker special\") in 4 sites.\n\nA voucher photo was taken of each reptile and amphibian species captured. Physical specimens were made from accidental trap mortalities, animals found dead from natural causes, and road-killed animals from Patagonia Lake State Park. All photos and specimens were deposited in the University of Arizona Herpetology Collection.\n\nI made 9 trips to SCSNA during the course of this project, from April through September 2006. I was assisted by a varying group of volunteers, most from the Tucson Herpetological Society. Total field effort included 208 person-hours over 18 calendar days. Additional effort included 228 trap days.\n\nAmphibians and reptiles found Amphibians and reptiles found Amphibians and reptiles found Amphibians and reptiles found Amphibians and reptiles found\n\nThe total complement documented for the study area is 9 amphibian and 27 reptile species (Table 1). We found 8 amphibian and 15 reptile species in the study area, and specimen or photo vouchers for 9 more reptile species were delivered to us during the study. An additional 1 amphibian and 3 reptile species were documented previously but not found during this study.\n\nComparing methods, we found 21 species through visual encounter surveys. The traps captured 10 species, including two snake species not found during visual encounter surveys. Incidental observations by SCSNA staff, including road-killed animals in Patagonia Lake State Park, identified 19 species including 8 species not found during surveys or in traps.\n\nNot counting anuran larvae, we made 396 observations of amphibians and reptiles during visual encounter surveys. Average observation rates were relatively low: using only search times by experienced personnel, we averaged 2.13 observations/hour overall, with 2.44 observations/hour for daytime searches and 1.32 observations/hour for night searches. For comparison, a 2-year herpetological inventory of the Whetstone Mountains found 2.52 observations/hour overall (Turner et al. 2003), and a 2-year herpetological inventory of Tumacacori National Historical Park found 4.52 observations/hour overall (Powell et al. 2005). We captured 71 amphibians and reptiles in traps, for a rate of 0.31 captures/trap-day. For comparison, the Whetstone inventory had 0.10 captures/trap-day , and the Tumacacori inventory had 0.28 captures/trapday.\n\nCompared to nearby riparian areas, this study found similar amphibian and lower reptile diversity. Research in Las Cienegas National Conservation Area documented 7 amphibians and 30 reptile species (Rosen et al. 2005). Research along the San Pedro River corridor documented 8 amphibian and 46 reptile species in the middle and upper reaches at elevations 3,305 -4,269 ft (Rosen 2005).\n\nTo determine the adequacy of our sampling efforts (i.e., how close we came to finding all species present), I constructed a graph showing accumulation of new species as a function of effort. The resulting curve appears to approach but not reach an asymptote, suggesting that we came near to but did not achieve a complete inventory (Krebs 1989, Scott 1994, Soberon and Llorente 1993). However, the discovery of 10 additional species through trapping and incidental finds by others shows that we may have simply been approaching the number of species that were reasonably observable that year during walking surveys.\n\nThere are likely several more amphibian and reptile species to be found in SCSNA. This includes several species of burrowing snakes that may occupy the organic-rich soils of the riparian zone, several upland lizard species, and the Ornate Box Turtle (Terrapene ornata). The rocky slopes of the Grosvenor Hills have the potential to harbor several additional species, but were not adequately sampled during this effort.\n\nRainfall patterns before and during this study probably affected the results. As expected, the presence of some anurans was associated with summer rains, and several snake species became more visible during that season. More interesting, though, was an apparent overall depression in reptile abundance, which I suspect resulted from several consecutive dry years. The vegetation in some areas pf SCSNA exhibited evidence of recent drought, including significant or complete dieback of mesquite trees on the uplands around Coal Mine Canyon.\n\nThe presence of Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) at SCSNA was unexpected, as it is outside their commonly-understood range (Brennan and Holycross 2006). The one individual observed along Sonoita Creek may be part of an outlier population, or may be a formerly captive animal released in the area. Even if the latter is true, the species is sufficiently long-lived that the individual will likely inhabit the area for many years, and thus the species is included on the list here.\n\nSpecies Species Species Species expected but expected but expected but expected but expected but not found not found not found not found not found We did not find five species confirmed by specimens or previous studies in the area, including Great Plains Toad (Bufo cognatus), Ornate Box Turtle, Southwestern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus cowlesi), Smith's Black-headed Snake (Tantilla hobartsmithi), and Yaqui Black-headed Snake (Tantilla yaquia). Several of these are secretive enough that they could easily be present but unobserved.\n\nOf greater concern are several conspicuous aquatic or riparian species for which historic specimens exist from nearby on Sonoita Creek, but which were not observed in this project:\n\n-Lowland Leopard Frog (Rana yavapaiensis), most recently vouchered in 1970 from Sonoita Creek, 5.5 miles SW of Patagonia.\n\n-Mexican Garter Snake (Thamnophis eques), most recently vouchered in 1974 from Sonoita Creek, 3 miles SW of Patagonia.\n\n-Giant Spotted Whiptail (Aspidoscelis [formerly Cnemidophorus] burti stictogramma), most recently vouchered in 1952 from 4.2 miles SW of Patagonia.\n\nOther species of concern Other species of concern Other species of concern Other species of concern Other species of concern Black-necked Garter Snake (Thamnophis cyrtopsis) were found near Sonoita Creek and in Coal Mine Canyon. However, only 3 were observed along Sonoita Creek and 2 in Coal Mine Canyon during the course of this study, despite repeated and extensive surveys along those and Fresno Canyon. This species is typically abundant and relatively conspicuous where present. Its scarcity suggests predation or competition by non-native species.\n\nAmong the native amphibians that were observed in SCSNA, one or more individuals of each species was found in or near Sonoita Creek, but I suspect the creek itself to be a population sink due to the suite of predatory non-native species there.\n\nProblematic non-native species Problematic non-native species Problematic non-native species Problematic non-native species Problematic non-native species The perennial aquatic environments in SCSNA have become degraded or hostile habitat for native amphibians and reptiles due to non-native wildlife, including American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), crayfish (presumed Orconectes virilis), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Cattle were frequently observed in the riparian areas during this study. The current level of livestock use has apparently altered the riparian plant communities, with likely effects on reptile diversity and abundance. Value for future monitoring efforts Value for future monitoring efforts Value for future monitoring efforts Value for future monitoring efforts Value for future monitoring efforts Species checklists can serve as the simplest and most effective method to detect large-scale changes in communities of organisms, if only through noting addition or deletion of species (Droege et al. 1998, Greenberg and Droege 1999).\n\nSpecies presence in repeated surveys can also be used to efficiently monitor population trend for individual rare species (Joseph et al. 2006), and raw data from this inventory could be incorporated into such an effort.\n\nSonoita Creek State Natural Area opened to the public in November 2006. Current management plans are designed to minimize effects on natural values, but some impact on the flora and fauna may be inevitable.\n\nMajor residential development is underway in Rio Rico, just west of SCSNA, and additional subdivision of the Salero Ranch on the northern and eastern flanks of the Natural Area. These will likely bring increased recreational pressures to the area, both permitted and not. They will also likely displace cattle ranching, reducing impacts of trespass grazing.\n\nThe uplands of SCSNA have been relatively isolated and rarely visited, with difficult access and no major attractions. I anticipate that rapid population growth around this area, coupled with opening of the Natural Area, will dramatically increase recreational use of the area in the next decade. Increased use will affect habitat quality for all wildlife, may lead to new species introductions, and may increase collecting pressure on some reptile and amphibian species.\n\nTable 1.
