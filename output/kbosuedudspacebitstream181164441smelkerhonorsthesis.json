    "abstract": "New laser-based flow diagnostic techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry are an attractive method for characterizing the velocity field of high-temperature jet flows. PIV required particle seeding and many current seeding techniques are not feasible within a high temperature flow. This research focuses on developing a system to generate uniform sub-micron solid particles and to seed them into a jet system with a high temperature air flow using a pH stabilized colloidal dispersion. The pH stabilized technique was first developed at NASA's John Glenn Research Center by Dr. Mark\nWernet. This research covers the design and development of a system to use the pH stabilized technique to produce sub micron particles for laser based flow diagnostics.\nSeeding is the key to producing accurate laser based diagnostics results. The seed size and material must be chosen to balance the ability to follow the flow, reflect measurable amounts of light, and exist within the testing application. For this research, 0.6 Âµm aluminum oxide was chosen as a balance of these three characteristics. The system to introduce these particles into the flow was produced based on its storage ability, flow and pressure control, and seeding capabilities. The system consists of an 8 gallon stainless steel pressure vessel, a Tescom pressure regulator, stainless steel tubing, needle and ball valves, and injector nozzles. The system produces seed for laser based flow diagnostics.\nExperiments were run at Jet Mach 0.9, 0.83, and 0.73 and compared to a baseline case at Mach 0.9 to see how well the seeder seeded the flow. The results show that the seeder produces aluminum oxide seed particles, and each test showed steady improvement in seeding the flow homogenously. However, this first generation seeder never seeded the flow as well as the baseline case. Recommendations for running heated jet experiments, iii adding air atomizing nozzles, using a solenoid control valve, and running multiple injection points are made to increase performance of the system.",

The free jet nozzle is one inch diameter and is located within an anechoic chamber that dampens the ambient noise within the system. A heater has also been added to the system to experimentally create heated flows that simulate jet exhaust. The goal of the research in this system is to develop techniques to control the noise pollution radiated by different types of jet flows.\n\nCurrently, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to map the velocity of the turbulent flow structures. The study of these structures allows for new methods of noise reduction and noise control to be developed.\n\nParticle Image Velocimetry is a planar measurement technique used to map the velocity field of a fluid flow (Melling 1998). A pulsed light sheet scatters light from the particles. The particles are suspended in the flow, and two exposures are taken of the particles. These images are compared in order to find the particle displacements between the two frames. This is done using a cross correlation technique where the images are subdivided into regions and the regions are correlated using a digital Fourier Transform to find out which particle regions correlate most to one another the (Wernet 1994). A two-dimensional picture of the velocity field is then made using the cross correlation data.\n\nIn order to seed a flow correctly, a good seed particle must be chosen for the specific application. An acceptable seed particle will be both large enough to scatter light and small enough to follow the flow accurately (Wernet 2004). The seeded particles also must be distributed homogenously when introduced to the flow and not agglomerated during introduction to the flow. There are many different types of seeding materials and seeding techniques (Melling 1997). Currently, the GDTL utilizes a LaVision commercial oil particle generator to seed the centerline flow and a fog generator to seed the co-flow.\n\nFor a heated flow the centerline seeder will not work because the oil particles will evaporate at the elevated jet temperatures.\n\nResearch and design of a refractory metal seeding system for high temperature air flows has previously been done (Wernet and Wernet, 1995). A pH stabilized colloidal dispersion of alumina in ethanol is created using a technique such that the pH of the solution is far away from the pH point of zero charge for the solution. The higher pH in the solution allows the particles sufficient energy to create a double layer of repulsion that overcomes the Van der Waals bonds that normally inhibit the use of a refractory in a seeding solution. Tests showed that a pH 1 solution of alumina in 100% ethanol would stay stable for 2.5 days (Wernet and Wernet, 1994). A commercial paint sprayer with an atomizer can be used to create a high quality aerosol with this solution. In the previous 3 research, a seeding system using a pH stabilized dispersion of alumina in ethanol was designed and implemented for a high temperature compressor system and the tests were successful (Wernet, et al. 1995).\n\nThis paper describes the design and testing of a portable system to generate sub micron particles for laser based flow diagnostics. The system concentrates on generating sub micron Aluminum oxide particles suspended in pH stabilized Ethanol and injected with a commercial atomizer. Chapter 2 of this thesis details the theory behind generating a well seeded flow. Chapter 3 details the design and testing procedure of the modular apparatus for generating the seed material and the apparatus used for the making the pH stabilized colloidal dispersion of Alumina. Chapter 4 shows and discusses the results of using the pH stabilized colloidal dispersion of Alumina versus using a commercial acetone seeder. Chapter 5 concludes on the work as well as makes recommendations for further work.\n\nQualitative flow diagnostics within complex flow fields have been explored over the last 100 years. With the technical progress within the last 20 years, qualitative diagnostics have evolved to the point where detailed quantitative measurement of complex flow fields can be obtained (Raffel, et al. 1998). Recently notable reviews of planar velocimetry (Samimy 1998) and particle seeding techniques (Melling 1997) have taken place. New techniques for seeding high temperature air flows have also been developed (Wernet and Wernet 1994) and tested (Wernet, et al. 1995).\n\nPIV is an indirect non-intrusive laser based flow measurement technique. The entrained particle velocity is recorded by taking two successive images of the particles illuminated by laser light. It is important to note that this is an indirect technique because the velocity of the particles is measured not the actual velocity of the flow. Laser illumination is generally carried out using a commercial laser and a series of mirrors and splitters to shape the beam into a sheet of light. The sheet is directed over the flow in either a cross-stream or stream-wise direction. Illumination of the particles happens according to Mie scattering theory which gives the cross sectional scattering property of particles. Mie scattering dictates that a particle that is much larger than the wavelength of light will have a scattering cross section with varying intensity based upon the observation angle, refractive index, particle size, and wavelength of light (Raffel, et al. 1998). The cross sectional reflection of particles affects the seeding of the flow. As an example, Figure 2.1 shows the Mie Scattering cross section for a particle. In this picture the circles are logarithmic graphs of intensity based upon 100, and the x-y axis is the scattering angle from 0-360Âº. Looking at this picture shows that the intensity of light varies with the angle of observation. It also shows that light is reflected in a cross section and not in a point. This means that each particle seen in PIV images is actually smaller than the visualized particles.\n\nRecording of the particle positions is accomplished with one of two techniques.\n\nThe first technique utilizes two lasers and a single CCD (charged coupled device) camera. The laser sheets are placed as close together as possible. The lasers are fired within microseconds of one another, and the camera takes two pictures of the flow based on each laser pulse. The GDTL currently uses this technique. Figure 2.2 shows a schematic of the GDTL jet system and the PIV setup. The second technique uses two cameras and a single laser. The two cameras are each calibrated to pick up only one type of polarized light, s or p light (Wernet 1995). When the laser illuminates the particle, the two types of polarized light are given off and recorded.\n\nIn order to obtain the planar velocity map, the two images from either technique are collected and analyzed via a computer. The analysis is performed using a cross correlation technique that divides the image into sub-regions. Each of these interrogation windows is subjected to a cyclic FFT given by the following equation:\n\nwhere I 1 and I 2 are the image intensities of the 1 st and 2 nd interrogation windows, and the C vector is the correlation strength of the displacement between the two interrogation windows. The size of the interrogation window is given by n in pixels. More information on this process can be found in the DaVis 7.0 Instruction manual. With these correlations, a vector map can be drawn and the flow velocity can be studied. Figure 2.2: GDTL Free Jet System with PIV Setup\n\nWhen using laser based flow diagnostics, generating good seeding is key to producing accurate results (Wernet 2004). In most seeding applications, the seed material must be non-toxic, easily attainable, and can be readily introduced to the flow.\n\nThe particles' size must be chosen according to a couple of principles. Firstly since laser based flow diagnostics do not measure the velocity of the flow directly but instead the velocity of the particles within the flow, the particle must be small enough follow the flow accurately. The time constant of a particle to achieve constant speed within a flow is given by the following equation:\n\nwhere d p is the diameter of the particles, Ï s is the time constant, Ï p is the particle density and Âµ is the dynamic viscosity of the seeded medium or flow (Raffel, et al. 1998). This equation assumes that the fluid acceleration is constant. Most flows cannot be characterized using this simplification, but this is still a convenient measure of particle settling time. Looking at this equation, the diameter of the particle lends a large amount of the time lag for the particle. With this, the smallest particles possible will follow the flow most accurately. In general, a particle of 1 Âµm or smaller will acceptably follow most turbulent flows or high speed gas flows (Melling 1997).\n\nEven though the smallest particles will most accurately follow the flow, the particles must also be large enough to scatter sufficient light for the camera. In general, the amount of light scattered by a particle is governed by the particle's size, shape, refractive index, and the orientation of the particle (Raffel, et al., Willert, and Kompenhans 1998). Thus, a balance exists between the particles being small enough to follow the flow accurately, and large enough to scatter light to be measured. The light scattering characteristics of particles is very important in choosing an acceptable particle.\n\nFor particles of similar size, the one with the higher refractive index will be the most suitable for a given application.\n\nThe flow application also dictates the material of the particle used. There are many different materials that can be used to properly seed a jet flow. Oil droplets or some type of Polystyrene Latex Spheres (PSL) are commonly used. However, for high temperature flows neither of these seed materials will work. PSL has a melting point of 250 ÂºC causing agglomeration at elevated temperatures (Wernet 1995). Oil droplets evaporate in flows where the temperature reaches levels far above ambient. Refractory metals are used for flows in which the temperature is above ambient (Melling 1997).\n\nSince the GDTL has started to use high temperature flows, this paper will focus on being able to generate sub-micron aluminum oxide particles for flow measurements. Aluminum oxide is a non-toxic, high refractivity, and easily attainable particle that is available in submicron sizes. Normally, aluminum oxide particles agglomerate when introduced to a flow. However, a new mixing technique has been made where the pH of the aluminum oxide solution is stabilized to stop agglomeration (Wernet 1994).\n\nSince aluminum oxide has a tendency to agglomerate when introduced to a flow, a new technique was developed in order to make aluminum oxide a viable seeding option. When a solid particle is suspended in a solution, the inter-particle forces dictate how stable the suspension will be. A suspension is stable once the repulsive forces are stronger than the attractive forces. When a particle is introduced into an acidic or basic solution, the polarity of the solution causes repulsive or attractive electrostatic forces depending upon the sign and strength of the polar solution. In a solution, the point of zero charge is the point where the polarity of the solution does not create an electrostatic layer on the particle. When the pH is below this point, a repulsive electrostatic layer is developed on the surface of the particles. To create a stable dispersion of alumina in ethanol, the pH of the solution must be lowered far below the point of zero charge for aluminum. Figure 2.3 illustrates how lowering the pH will create a stable dispersion (Wernet 1994). With a stable dispersion of aluminum in ethanol, the dispersion can be introduced to the flow without major agglomeration.\n\nParticle generation for seeding a flow is done on either a global or a local level.\n\nLocal seeding is the process by which seed is introduced into only the section of the flow field that is of interest for study. To accomplish local seeding, the seed is normally introduced into the flow at the area of study. Global seeding introduces seed to the entire flow field. Two parameters are important in global seeding. First of all, the injection point must be far enough upstream that the particles will be evenly distributed throughout the flow when the area of study is reached. Secondly, the injection point must not severely interfere with the flow. For this study, global seeding will be used.\n\nThe density of particles entrained within a flow is critical to generating PIV images that accurately approximate the movement of a complex gas flow. Firstly, there is a limit to the density of particles the flow. This limit is based upon the scattering characteristics of particles. Each particle has its own scattering cross section that the camera records. As the particles become closer together the intensity cross sections begin to overlap. This introduces noise into the image such that affects the accuracy of the PIV recording (Samimy 1998). There is also a lower limit to the number of particles within a region of flow. The flow field dictates that there enough particles to characterize the flow.\n\nThe general rule is that there should be at least 6-10 particles per interrogation window (Wernet 2004).\n\nSecondly, uniform particle number density is also important in accurately characterizing a complex flow field. A homogenous particle distribution gives the same number of particles in each interrogation window. A perfectly homogenously seeded flow will not show any flow structures but will have the same density of particles throughout the flow. This ensures that each section of the flow is characterized accurately.\n\nThere are multiple ways to introduce particles into a flow including oil particle generators, fog generators, cyclone entrainment, fluidized beds, and atomizers (Wernet 2004). Oil particle and fog generators use a condensation technique to create sub-micron oil particles. These particles are then injected into the flow. The GDTL employs both a commercial atomizer from LaVision to seed the core jet flow, and a theatrical fog generator for ambient air seeding. Cyclone entrainment and fluidized beds use a high pressure air jet to create a cyclone that picks up the small particles on the bottom of the tank and introduces them to the flow through the top of the tank. These techniques are normally used for introducing dry solid particles to a flow. Figure 2.4 illustrates the cyclone entrainment technique. Atomization is also a technique to introduce a solid particle to a flow. Atomization requires solid particles to be suspended within a liquid, and the liquid is pushed through a nozzle to create a quality aerosol. A liquid with a low vapor pressure, and an injection point well upstream of the area of study is used to make sure that the liquid is completely evaporated before the area of study. Chapter 3\n\nWhile the goal of the seeder is to produce uniform solid particles throughout the flow, the design of the components was based on a few crucial parts: storage ability, adaptability, pressure and flow control, and portability. Storage ability is broken down into two components, corrosion resistance for handling acidic dispersions and capacity to hold an hours worth of seeding solution. Adaptability is based on the seeder's ability to be used for multiple facilities in multiple arrangements. This means using parts and pieces that can easily be removed and reattached without a significant overhaul on the system. Pressure and flow control allow for multiple injection pressures and mass flow rates be used with Mach numbers ranging from 0-2. Portability is important for moving the seed generator to and from multiple facilities without a large amount of work.\n\nAfter reviewing the design of the seeder used from previous research and keeping in mind the design parameters, a system schematic was designed to highlight the major parts of the design. Figure 3.1 shows the schematic for the system. This schematic outlines the major components to introduce the pH stabilized dispersion into the free-jet facility. Shop air is supplied to the tank to create a differential pressure between the tank and the jet facility. The liquid will then flow from the tank and be injected into the jet facility.\n\nThe tank is the central and largest part of the system. It is made of Schedule 80 10\" 316 Stainless Steel pipe and the flanges are 300# 316 Stainless steel flanges.\n\nStainless steel was used because of its strength, durability, and corrosion resistance.\n\nFlexitallic spiral wound gaskets were used to seal the tank. This type of gasket reduces the effect of cathodic and anodic corrosion due to dissimilar metals coming into contact.\n\nThe height of the tank is 40\" and is capable of holding 8 gallons of pH stabilized dispersion. Two 2\" holes were drilled in both the top and the bottom of the tank to drain and put in the liquid. Both of these holes are tapped and plugged during operation. The bottom of the tank was machined to make a sloping drain throughout most of the bottom.\n\nThree 3/8\" holes are also drilled and tapped into the top of the tank; one is the inlet for the pressurized air, one is the outlet, and one is the pressure release. Two tubes reach into the tank cavity. The first tube reaches into the mid-section of the tank and is the inlet for the air. The second tube reaches to Â¼\" from the bottom of the tank and is the outlet for the liquid. All of the tubes within the tank are 3/8\" stainless steel connected with Swagelok fittings. Pressure is released from the tank with a 3/8\" Stainless steel ball valve. A pressure regulator controls the pressure of the air coming into the tank. The valve is a Tescom 44-1300s rated for 500 psi inlet and 0-150 psig outlet. It has a brass was used for its ease in attachment and removal. The fittings and tubing can be seen in Figure 3.4.\n\nControl for the seeder outputs is accomplished through a couple of different mechanisms. As shown in Figure 3.4, the primary flow control is accomplished through a ball valve followed in series by a needle valve. A pressure gauge in between the valve gives the liquid output pressure and can be used to approximate the injection pressure.\n\nThe ball valve gives the system two features. Firstly, turning the flow on and off from this point is accomplished without having to reduce the pressure within the tank. Thus, the system can be modified while it is still online. Sections locked down by ball valves can be taken off and replaced without having to drain the tank. Secondly, this valve acts as a quick disconnect point where the valve can be closed and all of the tubing after the valve can be adapted without having to vent the tank or turn off the incoming air. The needle valve gives the mass flow control for the system. Using a small needle valve, as shown in Figure 3.4, allows for good resolution in control of the flow to the injector.\n\nHowever, a pressure loss is introduced to the system when the valve is barely open such that the gauges located at the control panel will not precisely give the injection pressure.\n\nBoth of these valves are rated for 3000 psi and are made of 304 stainless steel. The gauge reads 0-300 psi and is rated for either liquid or gas.\n\nCommercial Atomizers accomplish injection to the jet flow. Atomization is used for seed generation because in order to generate a quality refractory metal aerosol the pH stabilization technique had to be used. Since this technique introduces the seed to a liquid, atomization fit the best for this process. A Spray Systems 1/4LND-316SS type fine spray nozzle was selected. This is a 303 stainless steel wall mounted nozzle that produces a spray by pushing a liquid through a small orifice. It produces the hollow cone pattern as seen in Figure 3.5. A hollow cone pattern allows the seed to be distributed in a wide angle throughout the flow such that mixing will occur rapidly within the flow. In selecting this nozzle, four orifice sizes were selected to give control over the amount of seed introduced to the flow at a given pressure. Table 3.1 shows the orifice sizes and maximum flow for each of the nozzles. These four nozzles give a wide amount of flexibility in choosing the right flow rate to produce a uniformly seeded flow. The flow rates listed in the table are for a pressure of 300psi. Since the shop air is at 120 psi, this high of flow rate will never be seen and does not factor into the decision to use these four nozzles. Figure 3.5 shows one of the nozzles used. The nozzle has a threaded head such that it can be wall mounted directly into the injection point on the jet facility.\n\nOrifice Number Orifice Size (in.) Maximum Flow rate at 300 psi (gph) 3 0.028 8.2 6 0.042 16.5 10 0.064 27 14 0.076 38 Table 3.1: Nozzle Orifice Sizes and Maximum Flow rates (Spray Systems Co. 2004)\n\nThe final major part to designing this system was making the system both portable and adaptable to other facilitiess easily. Since the tank weighs in excess of 600 lbs while empty, making it portable presented a sizable challenge. Previously, an acetone seeding system was designed to be moved using a dolly. However, when considering the weight of this system compared to that of the acetone system, this proved to be unfeasible and hazardous. The second option was to order a prefabricated cart that the tank could be bolted to and moved using the cart. A stainless steel heavy duty cart was ordered to accomplish this task. This seemed like a simple solution to moving the tank without a large amount of design work being done. The wheelbase for this cart was in a diamond pattern that was unstable when put under high point loads given by the support studs for the tank.\n\nFinally, a small cart with a rigid structure was designed using Solid Edge. Figure 3.6 shows the CAD picture of the cart. This design gives both horizontal and vertical support for the tank while it is on the cart. The horizontal supports between the main supports give rigidity to the cart structure, and the transverse supports give lateral support to the structure as the cart moves. The base cart is a 24\" x 36\" commercially available cart rated for 1200 lbs equipped with 9\" diameter wheels. Having large wheels ensures that bumps and discontinuities on the floor will not compromise the stability of the moving tank. The structure on the cart stands 44\" high and is 24\" square. This footprint is 6.5\" greater than that of the tank such that the horizontal support can be taken off of the structure and the tank can be moved from the cart. During construction of the cart, the long transversal pieces were switched for shorter floor mounted brackets. These were easier to make and smaller while giving adequate stability for the cart. Figure 3.7 shows the completed cart with the seeder on it. The structure for the cart is made of U-Shaped bar with Â½\" bolts slots located at every inch of the bar. The main supports are welded to the cart. The side horizontal supports are bolted to main supports with Â½\" bolts. Overall, this gives a stable and easily portable design for the seeder. Adaptability for the system was accomplished in a couple of ways. Firstly, all of the tubing and pipe fittings are done using Swagelok compression fittings. These fittings do not use Teflon but are self sealing based upon compression of a metal ring that is forced onto the tubing. The configuration of the components can be changed easily with an adjustable wrench. Figure 3.8 shows the compression ring inside of the Swagelok fitting. Secondly, all of the tubing and pipe fittings for the system were based upon 3/8\" stainless steel tube. With a single tube size throughout the system, all pieces can be moved around within the system to find a suitable controls configuration for each application. Finally, ball valves were used extensively within the design to increase the modularity of the design. With these ball valves in place, each section of the tubing is its own module that can be shut off from the rest of the system for changes or repair without having to drain the tank or stop the pressure. In these ways, the system is adaptable to multiple configurations.\n\nLooking at the overall design of the seeder system, it meets the major design parameters in the following ways. As far as storage capabilities, the tank has storage capabilities for 8 gallons of pH stabilized dispersion which is more than enough for continuous operation for 2 hours, and all parts coming in contact with the acidic suspension are stainless steel with good corrosion characteristics. The tank also has a maximum pressure rating of 300 psi which is significantly higher than the 120 psi given from the shop air. It is adaptable to multiple configurations using Swagelok components and modularity achieved through ball valves. Pressure and flow control are achieved through the main Tescom Regulator, needle valves, and multiple types of injector nozzles. The cart makes the system portable to all points in the laboratory. Overall, the design meets all of the major design parameters for making a seed generating system.\n\nFrom the beginning of this project, aluminum oxide was the material of choice, but significant effort went into choosing a particle size and delivery system to the jet core. In previous experiments, the seed used was Sumitomo AKP-15 particles with a mean particle size of 0.7 Â± 0.2 Âµm (Wernet 1995). However, at the time of this research these particles were not available, so a particle size had to be chosen based upon the systems present at the GDTL and current particle sizes offered by manufacturers. As explained previously, the particle size is a balance between being small enough to follow flow accurately and also large enough to refract a measurable amount of light. With this in mind samples of two particles were obtained for experiments. Sumitomo contributed 2 kg each of AA-3 and AA-5 high purity aluminum oxide. The AA-3 and AA-5 particles have a mean diameter of 0.3 Âµm and 0.6 Âµm, respectively, and are of 99.99% pure. Since the previous research used a 0.7 Âµm particles with great success the 0.6 Âµm particles were chosen as the primary seed keeping the 0.3 Âµm particles as an experimental. This size particle has a lag time constant of 4.4 Âµs which does not affect its ability to accurately follow the flow, and with a refractive index of 3.96 this particle will reflect enough light to be measurable by the PIV system. Generation of the seeding particles is done through a commercial atomizer as explained above. Two injection points are available on the jet system. One is located at 9 ft upstream of the area of study and the second is located about 12 feet from the area of study. Figure 3.9 shows the first injection point. This picture shows that the nozzle injects the liquid directly into the flow. The second injection point has a bend before the area of study which is thought to help in the mixing of the particles within the flow.\n\nFor complete instructions on how to prepare a pH stabilized dispersion of Alumina in ethanol can be found in the literature (Wernet 1994). A 1% wt Aluminum oxide suspension was prepared using the Mass Balance Equation:\n\nwhere M is the mass of aluminum oxide in grams, Ï is the density of ethanol, and V is the volume of ethanol in milliliters. Using this equation 34 grams of aluminum oxide were added per gallon of ethanol. The dispersion was prepared in segments of 200 ml where an 8.5% wt alumina dispersion was made and diluted to 1% with 800 ml of stabilized ethanol solution. For a 200 ml dispersion of aluminum, the sonicator was used for 6-8 minutes with a 50% power level and a duty cycle of 1 second on and one second off. dispersion. Using this procedure, the pH stabilized dispersion of alumina in ethanol was prepared and used.\n\nThe Particle Image Velocimetry acquisition and processing system is a LaVision PIV System. This system encompasses all of the acquisition and processing equipment and controls. Images are acquired using a Red Lake 2000x2000 pixel CCD camera with a 90 mm Tamron lens. Control of the system is accomplished using a programmable timing unit (PTU). A dedicated PC with Xeon Intel Processor houses all of the DaVis 7.0 software and essential hardware. The PTU controls the operation of a Dual Head Spectra Physics 400 mJ Nd:Yag Laser. For this application, the laser was used in the second harmonic (532 nm) and at 70% of its rated power. Image sets were acquired at a rate of 1Hz and the laser pulses were programmed for a 2 Âµs space between each image. The laser sheet was produced using a set of cylindrical and spherical lenses. Great care was taken in aligning each of the lasers and a dot card was used to calibrate the system and focus the camera.\n\nTesting for this system was based on a couple of different goals. First of all, the system needs to show that it can generate sub-micron Aluminum oxide particles.\n\nSecondly, the new seeder should show that it is comparable in ability to the current setup at the GDTL. In order to accomplish these goals a series of tests were run. The GDTL, currently, uses an atomizer as its normal core flow seeder, and a fog generator for ambient air. Mach 0.9 is the case for which this seed generating produces a well seeded flow. To compare the aluminum oxide seeder with this case, an experiment at Mach 0.9 was done as well as two experiments at Mach 0.73 and 0.83. For the Mach 0.9 case, three injector nozzles were tested numbers 14, 6, and 3. For the Mach numbers lower than 0.9, the second injection point was used to see whether it improved uniformity in the seed.\n\nThroughout each of these cases, the pressure within the tank was varied. At each of the different Mach numbers and tank pressures, multiple PIV images were taken and processed to compare with the baseline case. They were also studied to look at ways of improving the new seeding technique. It is important to note that when implementing a new seeding technique, an iterative scheme is needed to correctly seed a flow. Testing using multiple Mach numbers, injection points, and tank pressures should show how each of these variables improves the seeding technique.\n\nUsing the aforementioned apparatus, as discussed in Chapter 3, and instructions to prepare pH stabilized solutions of aluminum oxide in ethanol, experiments were run according to Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 by Mach number. Images were taken at each Mach number and analysis was done by studying the images and qualitatively comparing it to a well seeded baseline case of seeded with oil particles. Comparisons are based upon the uniformity of the seed within the flow, a homogenous density, and also as the cases progressed on how improvements changed the results. It is important to note that the baseline images have the ambient air seeded and the test cases do not, so all of the analysis and discussion focuses on the jet core. of an image taken with the Aluminum oxide seeder at Mach 0.9. In each of these pictures, the color bar is a measure of intensity reflected from particles and the scales in millimeters are the coordinates within the actual flow. This experiment was run with the tank pressure at 55 psig, with an injector nozzle number of 3, and with injection at the first inlet. Tests were run using both the number 6 and number 14 fine spray nozzles, but the flow rate produced an extremely dense seed that did not characterize the flow well.\n\nLooking at the baseline case, the seed is uniformly distributed throughout the flow. This is seen by the uniform intensity particles throughout the picture. The density is also very uniform and within the established bounds because single particles can be seen. Looking at the picture for the test case, the seed is not uniform and it has too high of density. The uniformity and density are both seen in the middle of the flow where the seed appears as a single white streak. This streak is either a very dense section of seed or liquid ethanol spread within the flow. Throughout this experimental case, ethanol was dripping out of the jet nozzle due to the extensive amount of seed being introduced into the jet.\n\nComparing the baseline core flow with that of the experimental case, the experimental case does not show the entire jet, but instead the seed is concentrated towards the top of the jet. For this case, the seeder is producing a seed however it is not uniform and too dense to acquire accurate PIV data. Experimental image at Mach 0.83 and a tank pressure of 47 psig. In analyzing these pictures, it is important to note the changes that were made between this case and the Mach 0.9 case. In this case, the injection point was placed at 11 ft upstream from the flow and it is separated by a bend to enhance the mixing characteristics of the flow. Also, multiple data sets where taken corresponding to different tank pressures to see how changing the injection pressure changes the way seed is distributed throughout the flow.\n\nLooking at the case with a tank pressure of 47 psig shows extensive improvement over that of the Mach 0.9 case. The bright spots surrounded by sections of dark show that the density and distribution of the seed is still not completely comparable to that of the baseline case. In this case, the seed was mixed better than in the Mach 0.9 case, and the amount of seed injected was closer to the baseline case. The 47 psig case still does not completely characterize the flow. Figure 4.3 shows an image of the Mach 0.83 case experimentally seeded with the aluminum oxide seeder at a tank pressure of 80 psig. This picture shows a great resemblance to that of the 47 psig case. This case again shows a fairly good cloud of seed throughout the picture, but it also shows places where bright spots exist without any cloud around them. Each of these bright spots is a place where the seed density is too high and the camera cannot pick up individual particles. The higher tank pressure shows less bright spots. This means that the increase in injection pressure helped to make the particles mix more evenly with the flow. This case showed some progress towards the baseline case.\n\nLooking at the Mach 0.83 case as a whole, a couple of important things were learned during this experiment. First of all, the second injection point helps with mixing the particles throughout the flow a great deal. In comparing this case with that of the Mach 0.9 case, the seeding was better distributed and the density was at a place where PIV measurements could be made. However, there are still discontinuities in the distribution and density of the particles. It was also noted in this case that the needle valve did not give good control resolution. The valve only needs to be opened a very small amount for there to be enough seed, so control resolution is a problem in controlling the amount of seed entering the flow. It was seen that this case was a great improvement over that of the Mach 0.9 case. Within in this experiment, the second injection point was used. Looking at the 50 psig set of images, the experimental case shows a fairly homogenous distribution throughout the flow. This is seen in the cloud that characterizes most of the jet. Some parts of this do show places of bright spots and dark spots. This shows that the seed is still not completely mixing with the flow. However improvement has been made between this case and the Mach .83 cases. The 80 psig case shows too much seed within the flow. In this picture there are bright spots littered throughout the seeded region. These spots are places where the particle density is such that the scattering cross sections are overlapping and discrete particles cannot be seen. The 80 psig case also shows a non homogenous distribution of particles within the flow. The particles seem to be seeded towards the bottom of the jet and not as many in the top part of the flow. Comparing the two experimental cases shows that increasing the injection pressure does increase the amount of seed within in the flow. It does not, however, increase the seeds ability to mix throughout the flow. It is also interesting to note that throughout this experiment, ethanol would begin to drip out of the jet nozzle when the seed generator was generating too much seed. This is interesting because is shows that the ethanol is not completely evaporating, and it also says that some of the particles viewed within the pictures could be ethanol droplets and not alumina particles.\n\nAfter analyzing all of the data and studying the results, the following conclusions can be made. First of all, the new seeder does produce sub-micron particles for laser based flow diagnostics. All of the cases show that seed is being generated however, the seeder does not produce a uniform seed and it is not easily controlled. Non-uniformity is seen in all of the experimental figures where bright spots exist at many places and a consistent particle cloud does not exist as it does in the baseline case. Controller resolution is seen in all three of the experimental cases where changing the needle valve position a very small amount had a drastic effect on the amount of seed introduced to the flow. Secondly, these experiments demonstrate the ability to produce a pH stabilized dispersion of Aluminum oxide in ethanol. Being able to produce the seeding material easily had great affects on making the experiments possible and on how the experiments ran. Thirdly, the seed generator showed its portability, adaptability, and ease of use throughout the experiments. The portability was demonstrated with the cart, adaptability was demonstrated during experiments by changing injector nozzles without draining the tank, and ease of use is demonstrated by the Mach 0.9 being the first test ever run with this seeder and it working.\n\nWhile the seeder did generate seed, it did not generate a uniform particle density number or homogenous distribution of seed throughout the flow. This was seen in all of the experimental cases. The Mach 0.9 case had the worst distribution and seed density, and as the experiments progressed the seed densities and distributions improved. The pictures still did show that the improvements were not complete and that even in the Mach 0.73 case, the seed exhibited many places with a high density and low density. Part of the problem with the density and distribution was the lack of control resolution with the system. The needle valve did give as much resolution in controlling the mass flow rate of seed as was originally expected. This resulted in having very little control over how much seed was introduced to a system. Ethanol condensation happened when the seed mass flow rate was too high. This shows that evaporation was not occurring at a high of rate as was needed to produce completely dry seed. This contributed to the high density sections of seed within the images due to the agglomerations of liquid with particles suspended in it. While the generator did not generate a perfectly seeded flow, the experiments showed that the pH stabilized dispersion was a viable seeding solution and the seeder worked for introducing the seed solution into the flow.\n\nAfter looking at the conclusions, a few of design and experiment parameter improvements present themselves. First of all, experiments using the heated jet should be run. This will better characterize the abilities of this system since its design was for a heated application. Also, heating the jet will alleviate the problem of having ethanol droplets within the flow. Secondly, the first addition to the system should be an air atomizing nozzle. The currently used nozzle is a liquid atomizing nozzle which only pushes a pressurized liquid through a small orifice. An air atomizing nozzle uses a second stream of air within the nozzle to mix with the liquid before it goes through the orifice.\n\nThe main reason for using this type of nozzle is to enhance the mixing abilities of the particles. By introducing air into the nozzle, the density of the injection stream is less, so the air and dispersion mixture should mix with the flow more easily. This is also the same injection system that Dr. Wernet used in the previous research (Wernet and Wernet 1994). This type of system will create a finer spray such that the system should create a more uniformly seeded flow field. By using these recommendations, completely new sets of results can be attained to see how well the seeder works within a heated jet and in comparison to the previous research.\n\nAdding a solenoid control valve presents a way to increase the control resolution of the system. Controlling the system with good reliability was a problem that presented itself throughout each of the cases. The needle valve that was used could only be opened a very small amount to seed the flow with the right amount of seed. Opening the valve only a small amount introduces a pressure loss into the system. The control of the pressure is linked to that of the mass flow rate. Using a solenoid control valve would allow separate control of both of these variables. A solenoid control valve works by opening and closing a valve at a specified rate to produce a given mass flow rate without affecting the pressure. The con to adding this is that it needs an electrical input with a control system. It will, however, add much needed control to the system. Control should allow the experiments to be"
