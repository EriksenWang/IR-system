    "abstract": "Three alleles of the self-incompatibility gene of Nicofiana alata have been cloned and sequenced. A comparison of the sequences shows a surprisingly low level of homology (56%) and the presence of defined regions of homology and variability. The homologous regions include the N-terminal sequence, most of the cysteine residues and glycosylation sites, as well as other blocks throughout the sequence. We interpret these conserved regions as \"framework\" and nonconserved regions as \"hypervariable,\" following the terminology used to describe analogous regions in the IgG supergene family. The low level of overall homology forms the basis of a general method for isolating S-allele-specific cDNAs. Allele-specific antibodies can be generated using synthetic peptides corresponding to one of the variable regions. When applied to sections of the pistil, these antibodies label the intercellular matrix in the stigma and transmitting tissue of the style and the cell walls in the epidermis of the placenta. Hindlll digestion of genomic DNA generates a characteristic pattern of S-gene fragments for each genotype. These restriction fragment length polymorphisms can be used to assign S-genotype to progeny arising from breeding experiments.",
    "full_text": "The evolutionary success of flowering plants is attributed in part to the development of self-incompatibility, which acts to prevent self-fertilization and promote outcrossing (see de Nettancourt, 1977;Harris et al., 1984;Cornish, Pettitt, and Clarke, 1988, for reviews). In many plants with a genetically controlled self-incompatibility (SI) system, the specificity of the SI reaction is controlled by a single gene (S-gene), which has multiple alleles. Pollen is rejected if the same S-allele is expressed by both the pollen and the pistil. Self-incompatibility is divided into two main types: sporophytic, in which the pollen has the same S-phenotype as the parent, and gametophytic, in which pollen phenotype is determined by the haploid genotype of the pollen. S-Allele-associated glycoproteins have been identified in the styles of a number of plants which exhibit either gametophytic or sporophytic incompatibility. cDNAs encoding these glycoproteins have been isolated from Nico- tiana alata (gametophytic SI, Anderson et al., 1986) and Brassica oleracea (sphorophytic SI, Nasrallah et al., 1985Nasrallah et al., , 1987)).\n\nIn this paper, we describe the sequences of three alleles of the self-incompatibility gene of N. alata. ' To whom correspondence should be addressed.\n\nlsolation and Sequence of cDNA Clones Encoding the So-and Ss-Alleles of the SI Gene of N. alata The first cDNA clone described for a gametophytic SI system corresponds to the S,-allele of N. alata and crosshybridizes with RNA from styles homozygous for the S3and S,-alleles (Clarke et al., 1987;Bernatzky, Anderson, and Clarke, 1988, Figure 1 A). This weak cross-hybridization was used as a strategy to isolate cDNAs encoding other S-alleles.\n\nDifferential screening of cDNA libraries prepared from RNA isolated from mature styles of the S3S3-or s&genotype with cDNA prepared from SS,-or S6S6-RNA from mature styles showed that most plaques hybridized well with both probes. A few plaques in the S3S3 library (1.6%) hybridized strongly with the S S , probe and weakly with the probe, and a few plaques in the s6s6 library (1.6%) hybridized strongly with the && probe and weakly with the S3S3 probe. These plaques contained potential S3-cDNA and S,-cDNA, respectively. The S3-cDNA clones (50% of the clones obtained by differential screening) hybridized most strongly to an RNA from plants carrying an S,-allele (see Figure 1 B), but this RNA (about 1050 bases) appeared slightly larger than the related species in the S2-and S,-genotypes (900 bases). A minor hybridizing Three identical gel blots were prepared containing RNA from mature styles of S,S 3 , 8383, 8282, and S 6 S 6 genotypes. (A) Blot probed with 32 P-labeled S 2 -cDNA. (B) Blot probed with S 3 -cDNA. (C) Blot probed with S 6 -cDNA. Equal amounts of RNA (5 ng) were applied to each lane and EcoRI/Hindlll restriction fragments of A DNA were used as size markers. The autoradiograms were overexposed to show hybridization between different alleles.\n\nRNA species of about 650 nucleotides was also evident in the S 3 -genotype and was detected with both the S 3 -cDNA probe (see Figure 1 B) and the S 6 -cDNA probe (see Figure 1C). The S 3 -cDNA shares 64% homology with the S 2 -cDNA at the amino acid level (Figure 2), and the aminoterminal sequence matches that of the purified S 3 -glycoprotein derived by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Jahnen et al., 1989). The signal sequence of the S 3 -glycopro-tein is incomplete because the longest S 3 -clone (740 bp) terminated at an EcoRI site in the region coding for amino acids at positions 25 to 27 (see Figure 2). The rest of the sequence was obtained by RNA sequencing (Hamlyn, Gait, and Milstein, 1981). The S 6 -cDNA clones bound most strongly to an RNA species of about 900 bases from plants bearing an S 6 -allele (see Figure 1 C). The predicted amino acid sequence of the longest cDNA clone (803 bp) is shown in Figure 2. Overall, the homology at the amino acid level with the S 2 -glycoprotein is 62% and the predicted amino acid sequence of the S 6 -cDNA contains the aminoterminal sequence of the mature S 6 -associated glycoprotein (Jahnen et al., 1989). Alignment of the amino acid sequences derived from the S 2 -, S 3 -, and S 6 -cDNA sequences (see Figure 2) shows that there is about 56% homology overall. Although there are changes scattered throughout the sequence, the variation is mainly associated with four hypervariable regions (see Figure 2) which are predicted to be hydrophilic (see Figure 4A, regions A, B, C, and D). The conserved regions are associated with the amino terminus, the cysteine residues, the glycosylation sites, and the carboxy terminus. The 9 cysteine residues of the mature S 2 -glycoprotein are all conserved in the S 3 -and S 6 -glycoproteins, but the S 3 -and S 6 -glycoproteins have an additional cysteine residue at position 79. The S 2 -, S 3 -, and S 6 -glycoproteins contain 4, 5, and 4 consensus sequences for A/-glycosylation, respectively. Four of the W-glycosylation sites are in conserved positions in the three alleles, and none are included in the hypervariable regions apart from the fifth site, unique to the S 3 -glycoprotein (see Figure 2, position 102).\n\nPredicted Amino Acid Sequences of S 2 -, S 3 -, and S 6 -Glycoproteins.\n\nThe amino acid sequence is numbered beginning with 1 for the first amino acid of the mature protein. The putative signal sequence is indicated by negative numbers. Common sequences are boxed. The most variable regions are underlined. The potential N-glycosylation sites are circled. Gaps were included at positions 19, 20, and 160 in the S 2 -and S 6 -sequence and 188 in the S 2sequence to maximize similarity. The amino acid sequences were predicted from the nucleic acid sequences of the cDNA clones.\n\nThe question of whether these sequences represent allelic products of the same S-locus or products of distinct genes is addressed by DMA gel blot analyses and breeding experiments. Figure 3A shows a DMA gel blot analysis of a Hindlll digest of 8787, S 6 S 6 , 8383, and 8282 genomic DMA using the S s -cDNA as probe. The probe hybridized to single fragments from the S/S?-, S 6 S 6 -, and SsSa-genomic DMA and to two fragments from S^-genomic DMA. The S 3and S 6 -cDNA probes revealed the same restriction fragments, except that each cDNA clone bound strongly to fragments from homologous DNA and weakly to fragments from heterologous DNA (see Figure 3A). The weak crosshybridization is consistent with the variation distributed throughout the cDNA sequences.\n\nBreeding experiments were performed to determine whether the restriction fragments identified by the three cDNAs segregated with S-genotype in the F,-generation. Two plants with no common S-alleles (S,S 3 9 and S 6 S 7 6\") were crossed to produce 27 offspring, which were divided into incompatibility classes according to their ability to accept or reject SsSa-, S 6 S 6 -, or S^-pollen. Four incompatibility classes S,S 6 (7 plants), S,S 7 (4 plants), S;jS 6 (8 plants), and SaS? (8 plants) were obtained as predicted from the one locus hypothesis (de Nettancourt, 1977;Lawrence, Afzal, and Kenrick, 1978). A second population was produced by crossing two plants with one S-allele in common (S,S 3 $ and 8283 6); this population contained 21 plants, which fell into the two predicted self-incompatibility classes, S,S 2 (14 plants) and 8283 (7 plants). DNA gel blot analyses of these two populations (see Figures 3B and 3C) showed that, for each plant, the S-genotype assigned by breeding behavior was identical with that predicted by analysis of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Although the patterns described are for the major hybridizing bands, there are fainter bands that become apparent after longer exposure. These are indicated by arrows in Figures 3A and 3C.\n\nAn antibody was raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to a stretch of the major hypervariable region B, which is hydrophilic (see Figure 4A, Region B) and thus predicted to lie on the surface of the glycoprotein (Hopp and Woods, 1981). This antibody bound specifically to the S 2 -glycoprotein in protein gel blots under conditions where there was no detectable binding to the other buffer-soluble style proteins or to other S-allele glycoproteins (see Figure 4B).\n\nLight microscope localization of antibody binding is shown in Figure 5.

Each lane contains DNA from a separate plant and is labeled with the S-genotype assigned by breeding behavior. The distinct Hindlll restriction fragments associated with the S 2 -, S 3 -, S 6 -, and S 7 -alleles are indicated by arrows. The probe was a combination of S 2 -, S 3 -, and S 6 -cDNA clones labeled by random priming. No S!-genotype-specific fragments were detected with this probe. S,-Genotype was therefore assigned when fragments corresponding to the other genotypes were absent. Two fragments (a and b) hybridized weakly to the probe.\n\n3.33 -\\ I, -2.93-_____Peptide -22 1 30 60 90 120 150 180\n\nAmino acid residue number pistil, the antibody bound primarily to the extracellular material in the stigma and transmitting tract of the style.\n\nIn the ovary, the antibody was localized on the epidermis of the placenta and in a thin layer surrounding each ovule.

The S,-, S 2 -, S 3 -, and S 6 -allele-associated proteins are indicated by arrows. The S 3 -associated protein is present in lower amounts than the other S-allele-associated glycoproteins and is often masked by a protein of the same mobility, which is present in all genotypes (Jahnen et al., 1989).

The intercellular matrix (IM) is heavily labeled with immunogold markers. In addition, there is some labeling of the cytoplasm of the transmitting tract cells. Amyloplasts (AM), mitochondria (Ml), and vacuoles (VA) are not labeled. (B) Similar section to (A) labeled with control antibody. There is no specific labeling in any region.

The cell wall is heavily labeled.\n\nto the transmitting tissue cells (see Figure 6A). The control anti-arginine vasopressin antibody did not label any structures in the style (see Figure 6B). In the locule, the labeling is concentrated over the primary wall of the placenta1 epidermal cells (see Figure 6C).\n\nA major finding of this study is the extent of variation between the alleles. Alignment of the amino acid sequences derived from the S2-, S3-, and S6-cDNA sequences shows that, although there is more than 50% homology, there are also regions of considerable diversity. We describe these nonconserved regions as \"hypervariable\" and the conserved regions as \"framework\" regions following the terminology described by Wu and Kabat (1970) for immunoglobulin structure. This feature of hypervariable and framework sequences in related proteins is common to a number of animal proteins encoded by the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (Williams and Barclay, 1988).\n\nEach of these genes is concerned with some aspect of cell recognition, and this seems to be a characteristic feature of this class of molecules. The products of the S alleles are presumed to have a recognition function, as the growth of pollen tubes bearing a particular allele is arrested within the style of plants bearing the same allele (de Nettancourt, 1977). It is possible that the conserved cysteine residues act to form disulfide bonds and present the hypervariable regions in binding domains as for the immunoglobulin supergene family. The variation in the amino acid sequence of the S-allele products is associated with hydrophilic regions, which are predicted to be on the surface of the molecule (Hopp and Woods, 1981), and would be accessible for binding to appropriate receptors in the pollen or pollen tube. Antibodies raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to a stretch of the major hypervariable region bound to the native S2-glycoprotein in fresh and fixed tissue sections as well as in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (data not shown), suggesting that this peptide is exposed at the surface of the glycoprotein. The use of the synthetic peptide as an antigen obviated the difficulties previously encountered using either polyclonal or monoclo-na1 antibodies raised to purified Sn-glycoprotein. These difficulties of cross-reactivity with other style glycoproteins were due to the glycosyl substituents on the Sn-glycoprotein, which have saccharide sequences common to many plant glycoproteins and which are immunodominant (Howlett and Clarke, 1981;Anderson, Sandrin, and Clarke, 1984). lmmunocytochemical studies with the antipeptide antibody showed that the S2-glycoprotein is localized extracellulary in the mucilage that surrounds the transmitting tissue cells and the wall of the ovule. This corresponds to the expression of the S,-gene in transmitting tissue cells and the epidermis of the placenta demonstrated by in situ hybridization (Cornish et al., 1987). The secretion of the S,-glycoprotein is consistent with the presence of signal sequences detected in two of the cDNA clones. The extracellular location in the mucilage of the transmitting cells and the ovule coincides with the pathway of pollen tube growth so that the pollen tubes would be in contact with the S2-glycoprotein as they grow through the pistil.\n\nThe carbohydrate chains are another source of potential variation and hence of potential allelic specificity. Although the glycosylation sites are conserved, the numbers of chains present vary and the sequences within these chains may also vary. Detailed structural analysis of the individual chains is required to clarify this point.\n\nTogether, the DNA gel blot analyses of genomic DNA and the breeding data indicate that the three cDNAs described are indeed allelic products of the same gene. Each S-allele has a characteristic set of Hindlll restriction fragments (Bernatzky et al., 1988) which hybridize most strongly to cDNA encoded by that allele and weakly with cDNA encoded by other S-alleles. This indicates that the S2-, S3-, and S6-cDNAs are derived from the same locus.\n\nIf they were from different loci, the DNA gel blot analyses would be expected to show bands corresponding to all genotypes in each track, unless there was specific deletion of genes corresponding to all but the expressed allele. Breeding experiments demonstrated that the allele-specific RFLPs segregated with S-genotype in plants produced by crossing two individuals with no alleles in common or with one allele in common, consistent with the interpretation that the S2-, S3-, and S6-cDNAs represent alleles of the same locus or closely linked genes. Faint bands common to each genotype (see Figure 3A) were detected in DNA gel blot analyses; the significance of these bands cannot be interpreted until the corresponding DNA is cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the three N. alata S-glycoproteins with the amino acid sequences of S-glycoproteins from the sporophytically controlled self-incompatibility of Brassica spp. (Isogai et al., 1987;Nasrallah et al., 1987) shows that there is no homology between the sequences of the two groups of Sglycoproteins, suggesting that the two systems of selfincompatibility evolved separately. The allelic S-glycoproteins from Brassica species have a higher leve1 of sequence homology than the three allelic S-glycoproteins from N. alata; like the N. alata S-glycoproteins, the cysteine residues are conserved, but there is apparently more variation in the numbers of potential glycosylation sites.\n\nIn the absence of information on the corresponding Sallelic products for pollen, it is difficult to interpret the amino acid sequence data in functional terms. We are also cautious of drawing general conclusions from a relatively narrow data base; in some systems such as clover (Attwood, 1944;Williams, 1947), severa1 hundred alleles exist. At present we have information on only a few of the many alleles of two self-incompatibility systems; as more se-quence data from related systems become available, the structure-function relationship will become clearer.\n\nPlants were maintained in a pollinator-proof glasshouse. S-Genotype was assigned by monitoring for seedset after hand pollination with pollen from tester plants homozygous for the S7-, SS-, S3-, and S,-alleles.\n\ncDNA Library Construction and Screening Poly-A+ RNA was isolated from mature S& and s& styles, and double-stranded cDNA was prepared using the Ribonuclease H method and Amersham Kit RPN1256. The cDNA was cloned into XgtlO (Huynh, Young, and Davis, 1984), and SBand Ss-clones were selected from the libraries by differential screening with single-stranded 32P-cDNAs prepared from style poly-A' RNA from S3S3 and s& genotypes. Prehybridization (2 hr at 68OC) was in 1.5 x SSPE, 1 .O% SDS, 0.5% BLOTTO, and 0.5 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA (Bio-Rad Bulletin 1234). Hybridization was in prehybridization solution with added dextran sulfate (1 0% w/v final concentration). The cDNA probes were used at 3 x 106 cpm ml-'. Prehybridization was for 2 hr at 68°C and hybridization for 16 hr at 68OC. Filters were washed twice in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68\"C, and once in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68OC. Clones from the S S 3 library that hybridized with the SS3-cDNA but not the &&-CDNA were rescreened with 3ZP-labeled S2-cDNA clone NA-2-2 (1 x 106 cpm/ml; Anderson et al., 1986). The clones selected in this way hybridized strongly with total SS3-cDNA, weakly with the S,-cDNA clone, and not detectably with the total S&-CDNA, and were therefore the most likely candidates for cDNAs encoding the S3-alleles. The S&&-CDNA library was screened in the same manner except that clones were selected which hybridized to S,&-CDNA and not SS,-cDNA. One candidate clone, with the longest insert, was selected for each of the S3-and S,-alleles and used for subsequent work (NA-3-1, NA-6-1).\n\nThe cDNA inserts from clones NA-3-1 and NA-6-1 were ligated into either the bacteriophage vector M13mpl8RF DNA for singlestrand sequencing or into pGEM-3 (Promega) for double-strand sequencing using the chain termination method.\n\nSequence data obtained in this way were analyzed as described previously (Anderson et al., 1986).\n\nDNA and RNA Gel Blots RNA gel blot analysis was performed using 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels as described previously (Anderson et al., 1986). The RNA was transferred to hybond-N (Amersham) and probed with either 32P-labeled S2-cDNA (NA-2-2), S3-cDNA (NA-3-l), or S6-cDNA (NA-6-1) (3 x 10' cpm pg-', 1 X 106 cpm ml-').\n\nPrehybridization (2 hr, 68°C) was in 1.5 x SSPE, 1 .O% SDS, 0.5% BLOTTO, and 0.5 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA (Bio-Rad Bulletin 1234). Hybridization was in prehybridization solution with added dextran sulfate (1 0% w/v final concentration).\n\nFilters were washed twice in 2 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68OC, and once in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68OC. DNA for gel blots was prepared from 10 g of leaf tissue according to the method of Bernatzky and Tanksley (1986a). The genomic DNA (5 pg) was digested with Hindlll and fractionated on 0.9% w/v agarose gels before transfer onto a Zetaprobe membrane (Bio-Rad). The transfer and hybridization procedure was as described by Bernatzky and Tanksley (1986b) except that the DNA was transferred to the membrane by \"wet blotting\" in 0.5 M NaOH. The membrane was then neutralized with 0.5 M Tris-HCI, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5, followed by 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS before hybridization at 68°C. Filters were washed in 1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68OC and exposed to x-ray film at -7OOC for 4 days. A Hindlll digest of X DNA was used as fragment-size markers.\n\nThe 22-amino acid peptide\n\nstarting from position 47 (Figure 2) was synthesized by the BOC-polystyrene solid-phase procedure using an Applied Biosystems Model 430A peptide synthesizer. The assembled peptide was cleaved from the resin with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and the crude peptide purified by preparative reversephase HPLC using a pBondapak C18 column (buffer A, 0.1% TFA-water, buffer B, 0.1 o/ o TFA-water-60% acetonitrile; 10% to 80% B over 60 min). The purified peptide was found to be homogeneous, as assessed by analytical HPLC and amino acid analysis. The yield from crude was 24%. The purified peptide (5 mg) in the reduced, monomeric form was conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin (0.5 mg) (Skowsky and Fisher, 1972). The conjugated peptide (1 mg/ml in PBS) was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Three sheep were injected intramuscularly with 2 ml. After 4 weeks, booster injections containing 0.5 mg of peptide conjugated to 0.1 mg of thyroglobulin and emulsified into 1 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant were given to each of the three sheep. After 6 weeks, the sheep were bled. The antibody levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay using lZ51-peptide as antigen (Skelly, Brown, and Besch, 1973).\n\nThe antibody was affinity purified on an S,-peptide Sepharose column. The column was prepared by covalent attachment of 5 mg of S,-peptide to 5 g of activated CH-Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sheep serum (5 ml) was applied to the column. Bound antibody was eluted using citric acid-phosphate buffer and was pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (yield, 7 ml, 400 pg/ml).\n\nStyle extracts were prepared by crushing three mature styles in 150 pI of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5, 1 O mM EDTA, 1 mM CaCI,, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The extracts were microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4OC and 5 pl of the supernatant was removed and applied to an SDSpolyacrylamide gel (1 2.5%) in Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970).\n\nWhen electrophoresis was complete, the gel was electroblotted and the nitrocellulose was incubated with affinity-purified, antiS2-peptide antibody (0.8 pg/ml in 1% gelatin in TBS [20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl]). The nitrocellulose was washed with 0.05% Tween in TBS, and the bound antibody was visualized by incubation with rabbit anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (0.1 pg/ml in 1% gelatin in TBS, Bio-Rad), followed by washing in 0.05% Tween in TBS and incubation with horseradish peroxidase color development solution (Bio-Rad). lmmunocytochemistry Styles (S&-genotype) were fixed as previously described (Mc-Fadden et al., 1988). For immunofluorescence, 1-pm sections were incubated with anti3,-peptide antibody (30 pg/ml) in SC buffer (McFadden et al., 1988) for 1 hr at 20°C. Sections were washed in SC, and then incubated with rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1 :50 dilution, Sigma) for 1 hr at 20°C. Ultrathin sections for EM were incubated with anti-S,-peptide antibody (30 pg/ml) for 1 hr at 2OoC, washed, and then labeled with rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibody conjugated to 15 nm colloidal gold (EY Laboratories). The control antibody, raised in sheep against the synthetic peptide arginine vasopressin and purified by affinity chromatography, was a kind gift from Dr. Mario Congin."
