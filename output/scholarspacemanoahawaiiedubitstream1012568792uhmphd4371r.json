The incidence of ARDS is uncertain but has been estimated to be as high as 75 cases per 100,000 hospitalized patients per year. The overall mortality of patients with ARDS remains at 40 to 60 percent. Many factors predispose to ARDS, with sepsis caused by gram negative bacteria being one of the most important. Experimentally, ARDS can be mimicked by the injection of bacterial endotoxin.\nPrevious studies in our laboratory showed that pretreatment with pentoxifylline (a methylated xanthine), bepafant (a platelet activating factor antagonist) and nicardipine (a calcium channel blocker), 15 minutes before the administration of endotoxin, reduced the mortality and manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by endotoxin in rats. The objective of the present study was to determine whether these drugs would also protect the rat lung against the deleterious effects of endotoxin.\nAnesthetized rats were given endotoxin (10 mg/kg) intravenously.

Pretreatment in vivo with nicardipine and bepafant, 15 minutes before the administration of endotoxin, significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced increases in capillary permeability and filtrate outflow but did not significantly affect the other parameters of measurement. Pretreatment with pentoxifylline differed from other two drugs in that the methylated xanthine significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced increases in all of the hemodynamic parameters as well as the increase in capillary permeability and filtrate outflow.\n\nStudies were also made on the effect of endotoxin on the pulmonary leukocyte count in rats. In these experiments, lungs were removed for histological examination one hour after the intravenous administration of endotoxin (10 mg/kg). Leukocyte numbers were significantly increased in the endotoxin group as compared to the saline group.\n\nPretreatment with nicardipine and bepafant but not pentoxifylline significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced increase in pulmonary leukocyte count.\n\nThe present results thus showed that the three drugs can protect against endotoxin-induced lung injury, in addition to preventing disseminated intravascular coagulation and death caused by the lipopolysaccharide. Pulmonary migration/sequestration of leucocytes and production/release of autacoids and cytokines from leucocytes are thought to play important roles in the lung injury caused by endotoxin. The results with nicardipine and bepafant suggest that these agents may act at least in part by inhibiting the pulmonary migration/sequestration of leucocytes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS iii ABSTRACT iv LIST OF TABLES viii LIST OF FIGURES ix LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS xii CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1 1.1 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 1 1.2 Endotoxin 13 1.3 Objectives 18 CHAPTER 2: MATERIALS AND METHODS 19 2.1 Preparation of the Animals 19 2.2 Isolated Perfused Rat Lung 19 2.3 Determination of Segmental Resistance 2.4 Measurement of Filtration Coefficient (Kf) 2.5 Histological Examination 2.6 Experimental Protocol for Isolated Perfused Rat Lung Experiments 2.7 Experimental Protocol for Histological Studies 2.8 Drugs and Chemicals 2.9 Data Analysis CHAPTER 3: RESULTS VI 3.1 Effects of Endotoxin on Pulmonary Hemodynamics in Rats Anesthetized with Pentobarbital 30 3.2 Effects ofNicardipine on Rat Lung Injury Induced by Endotoxin 3.3 Effects of Bepafant on Rat Lung Injury Induced by Endotoxin 52 3.4 Effects ofPentoxifylline on Rat Lung Injury Induced by Endotoxin 3.5 Studies on the Effects on Endotoxin on Pulmonary Leucocyte Count.. 74 CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Endotoxin-Induced Lung Injury 4.3 Pentoxifylline 4.4 Bepafant 4.5 Nicardipine 4.6 Summary BIBLIOGRAPHy Vll LIST OF TABLES 1.

A recent consensus conference on ARDS sponsored by American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society defined ARDS (Table 1) (2) as \"The most severe form of acute lung injury, which is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability that is associated with constellation of clinical, radiological and physiological abnormalities that can not be explained by, but may exist with, left atrial or pulmonary capillary hypertension.\"\n\nAnother definition proposed by Kollef and Schuster (3) describes ARDS as a set of clinical manifestations due to severe acute lung injury precipitated by direct or indirect lung injury, characterized pathologically by diffuse alveolar damage, and pathophysiologically by the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to increased microvascular permeability.\n\nThe incidence of ARDS is unknown but has been estimated to be as high as 75 cases per 100,000 hospitalized patients per year (4). The overall mortality of patients with ARDS remains 40% to 60% (2,5). Most of the patients who die with ARDS do so in the first 2 weeks of the illness, usually due to sepsis and multi-organ failure. On the other Infiltrates seen on frontal no clinical evidence of left atrial chest radiograph hypertension Pa02 = arterial oxygen tension; FI02 = inspired oxygen concentration; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.\n\nhand, it has been shown that outcome is better in patients who are younger than 60 years of age and those with sepsis as the risk factor for ARDS (6),\n\nMany factors predispose to ARDS (Table 2). These are categorized as causing direct injury to the lung, or factors that indirectly lead to lung injury. Certain factors like sepsis, near drowning, aspiration of gastric contents, multiple traumas, and multiple transfusions are more likely than others to lead to ARDS (2,7,8). Also, the risk for the development of ARDS rises with the increase in the number ofpotential risk factors (8).\n\nThe recognized pathologic lesion in acute lung injury and ARDS is diffuse alveolar damage, the appearance of which is determined by the duration and extent of lung injury and repair. The earliest lesion is described as exudative and typically occurs in the first week after injury, with findings of widespread but patchy areas of alveolitis with interstitial edema and hemorrhage. Hyaline membrane formation occurs as a result of precipitated plasma proteins and fibrin accumulation. Subsequently, Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia occurs, with local areas of Type I cell destruction and exposure of basement membranes. There is an early interstitial infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells. Although the alveolar capillary barrier may be most affected, large endothelial gaps are not seen (9 -11).\n\nA proliferative or organizing stage follows after 7 to 10 days, manifest by fibrin deposition in the alveoli and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts.\n\nType II pneumocytes proliferate, resulting in almost cuboidal alveolar walls. The airblood interface may be dramatically altered by the interstitial and cellular changes and the vascular bed may be disrupted. A final stage of fibrotic changes of alveolar ducts, alveoli, and the interstitium can result in almost complete alveolar obliteration (10).\n\nAfter the initiating aggression, the widespread and acute inflammatory response begins with localization of active polYmorphonuclear cells to the pulmonary microvasculature. These inflammatory cells actively participate in the process of phagocytosis and opsonization of foreign bodies and cellular debris. Subsequent degranulation and release of reactive oxygen species and other enzYmes occur, and through interactions with endothelial cells, cytokines, and complement components, the ensuing local inflammation results in endothelial cell injury. This endothelial injury produces changes in the permeability, release, and metabolism of vasoactive and inflammatory substances and alterations in hemofluidity and hemodynamics, with resultant abnormalities in gas exchange (Figure 1).\n\nPulmonary endothelial cells face both the environmental surface and the vascular compartment, and thus are highly vulnerable to injury. Endothelial cells are actively involved in ARDS development by changes in production and release of vasoactive substances, including serotonin, norepinephrine, bradykinin, prostaglandins, endothelins, and cytokines (12,13).\n\nOne of the early, major steps involved in neutrophil and monocyte migration is the modulation and display of adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules play an early and central role in the inflammatory response by promoting adhesion of neutrophils and monocytes to the endothelium (9,12). The selectins are a family of molecules with three single-chain glycoproteins designated by the prefixes E, P, and L for endothelial, platelet,\n\nInsult or ... ~onocyte/nnacrophage predisposing condition ~activation • Proinflammatory cytokines Endothelial (e.g., TNF, IL-I, IL-6, IL-8) Neutrophil cell selectin and lipid (cyc1ooxygenase, .... lipoxygenase) products rolling .... expression ....

Both E-and P-selectins are expressed on endothelial surfaces (Figure 2) (13). E-selectin protein is translated and is expressed following exposure to TNF-a, ILl, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Four to six hours are required after transcription to increase expression, with subsequent induction of neutrophil adhesion by promoting cell rolling through interactions with neutrophil carbohydrate ligands, sialyl Lewis x (SLe X )\n\nand others (e.g., SLe a ) (13). P-selectin is upregulated rapidly following endothelial cell exposure to proinflammatory mediators because it is localized in cytoplasmic granules.\n\nIntercellular adhesion molecule-l (ICAM-1) is expressed constitutively on endothelial surfaces. Following cytokine, leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ), or LPS exposure, transcription occurs for up to 24 hours (13,14). Intercellular adhesion molecule-l and closely related ICAM-2, located on endothelial cells, are ligands for ~2-integrins on the neutrophil surface and arrest neutrophil rolling by initiating adhesion and subsequent migration (13,15 -17). ICAM-l interacts with lymphocyte function-associated antigen-la (LFA-Ia), which is also known as CDlla. In an acid aspiration model of acute lung injury, administration of monoclonal antibodies to block the ICAM-l/LFA-la pathway resulted in attenuation of leukocyte numbers recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and subsequent injury, indicating the importance of this pathway to the inflammatory response in ARDS (18). Elevated plasma levels of E-and P-selectins and ICAM-l were measured early in critically ill patients with sepsis and those with established acute respiratory failure, and have prognostic significance (13,19,20).\n\nPlatelets, endothelium, neutrophils (Sialylated fucosylated lactosamines, i.e., sLe x , sLe A , and Lselectin) CCP domain P-selectin platelet, endothelium Leucocytes (Sialylated fucosylated lactosamines, i.e., sLe x , sLe A , and Lselectin) E-selectin endothelium Endothelium (Sgp50, Sgp90) L-selectin leucocytes The endothelial cell-neutrophil interactions facilitated by proinflammatory mediators are complex. Normal endothelium and neutrophils possess negatively charged surface particles, causing repulsion during random contact. To overcome shear and repulsive forces, as neutrophils course through the circulation at rates of up to 2.5 mm/second (21), vascular P-and E-selectins expressed after proinflammatory insult interact with polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to begin rolling adhesion (13,22).\n\nEndothelial-expressed carbohydrate ligands (Gly-CAM-l) interact with L-selectin on the neutrophil, and P-and E-selectin interact with SLe x on the neutrophil surface. Studies have shown that both anti-L-selectin and anti-SLe x antibodies are required to attenuate neutrophil rolling (19,23). Further endothelial activation with synthesis and release of mediators such as platelet activation factor (PAF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) promote rolling (13). Finally, integrin-ICAM-l binding occurs, and activated PMNs adhere tightly and flatten, forming a microenvironment protected from circulating inhibitors that favors local endothelial injury (13).\n\nNeutrophils playa prominent role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, through changes in local accumulation, activation state (local production of injurious compounds), and interactions with the production of cytokines. Neutrophils are not required for lung injury, however, as ARDS develops in neutropenic patients after chemotherapy or radiation (12,24,25). Neutrophil influx is known to occur before lung damage occurs (26). In patients with ARDS following sepsis, a recent study found that BAL neutrophil counts were higher in the first 2 weeks post-injury and correlated inversely with survival, indicating that persistent alveolitis is associated with a worse prognosis (27).\n\nNeutrophil adherence to the endothelium is an early event facilitated by selectin and p-integrins. L-selectin is expressed on most circulating PMNs in high-density microvillous-like processes. Once activated, L-selectin is shed and retains biologic activity in plasma (Z8). Carbohydrate determinants (SLe X and others) on neutrophils and monocytes are recognized by all three selectins. Removal of L-selectin from PMN surfaces still permits binding of E-selectin to PMNs (Z9). Sialyl Lewis x has a higher affinity for E-and P-selectins and only when anti-L-selectin and anti-SLe x antibodies are combined is PMN-endothelial binding completely inhibited (13,30). The counter receptor for L-selectin on the endothelium is unknown, but is thought to be Gly-CAM-l (13,31).\n\nThe pz integrins are molecules consisting of noncovalently linked a and p subunits expressed on leukocytes (13) that mediate firm adherence to the endothelium, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis (3Z). p subunits are composed of a common structure designated CDI8; a subunits vary in size and structure and are designated CDlla (LFA-1), CDllb (designated MAC-I, MO-l), and CDllc (known as p150) (13). Endothelial surface ICAM-l is the major ligand for pz integrins. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-l (CDllaJCDI8) and MAC-l (CDllb/CDI8) are the primary pz integrins that PMNs employ for adhesion following upregulation by inflammatory cytokines (13,33).\n\nElevated basal expression of the pz integrin CD 11b/CD18 in both whole blood and in BAL fluid has been shown in patients with ARDS. This overexpression of adhesion molecules may contribute to ongoing lung injury in ARDS (34); indeed, CD 11b/CD18 has been shown in experimental models to playa key role in lung injury (34 -37). In a study of ARDS patients, both whole-blood and alveolar PMNs were activated under basal conditions, as shown by decreased CD62L (caused by the shedding of L-selectin after activation) and increased CDIIb expression. The degree of PMN activation correlated with the degree oflung injury (34).\n\nNot only are the numbers of alveolar and interstitial neutrophils increased; the activation state of the neutrophils is altered in ARDS as well. This was reported earlier (37,38), and a study using flow cytometry to examine the activation status of circulating neutrophils found that a subpopulation of \"primed\" neutrophils with an increased capacity to release hydrogen peroxide was present in ARDS patients (39). Neutrophils possess many functional receptors and adhesion molecules that are involved in activation.\n\nInterleukin-I, IL-8, and TNF-a are potent activators ofneutrophils and have been found in increased concentration in plasma and BAL fluid of ARDS patients (40 -42). Endotoxin (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria is a potent activator via the LPS-binding protein complex (LBP), which is designated CDI4 (43)(44)(45)(46)(47). Complement fragment C5a and IL-8 are potent chemotactic stimuli that also induce degranulation (45). The lipoxygenase pathway product, LTB 4 , and PAF induce activation (45). Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and interferon gamma (IFN-y) are weak activators ofPMNs.\n\nNeutrophil causes lung damage through the release of proteases and generation of reactive oxygen species. Activated neutrophils show increased adhesiveness and subsequent irreversible binding to stromal cells with subsequent degranulation and production of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anions. Elastase is the major protease released from primary granules by neutrophils in ARDS and can degrade elastin, other substrates including collagen (Types I, II, III, IV), fibrinogen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans (45,48). Lung neutrophils in those with ARDS contain increased quantities of elastase; increased concentrations of elastase found in BAL fluid 1 . h . f l \" (12 49 50) corre ate WIt seventy 0 ung Injury , , .\n\nNeutrophils also contain metalloproteinases (MMP), including collagenase (MMP-l), gelatinase (MMP-2), and stromelysin (MMP-3) (51). Collagenase is stored in small secondary granules, some of which are lost during migration. Excessive collagenolytic activity of collagen types I, II, and III is mediated by this enzyme and has been shown to occur in patients with ARDS (12). Gelatinase is a subfamily of two members named gelatinase A and B; these enzymes degrade type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes, denatured collagens, and elastin, and may play a significant role in ARDS. Increased gelatinase A and B activity has been documented in the BAL fluid of early ARDS patients (12).\n\nLarge amounts of oxygen metabolites, such as hydroxyl radical (•OH), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 0 2 ), and superoxide (02-), are generated by an activated neutrophil surface and NADPH, and contribute to tissue injury in ARDS (52,53). These oxidants are difficult to measure directly, but the myeloperoxidase (MPO) in neutrophil primary granules, which catalyzes the release of chloramine, halides, and hypochlorous acid, is elevated in the BAL of patients with ARDS (12,54). Further evidence for a role of excessive oxidant activity in the cellular injury in ARDS is the change in measured antioxidants in BAL fluid. In a study of patients with ARDS, total antioxidant levels were found to be increased (55), whereas glutathione-specific antioxidant activity was markedly reduced (56).\n\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC), a known antioxidant that may restore intracellular stores of glutathione, has been shown to prevent deterioration of lung mechanics in endotoxemic sheep and prevent capillary leak induced by IL-I in rats (1,57,58). In humans with ARDS, NAC reduced ventilator days in one study (59). In another study of severe ARDS, intravenous NAC administration increased intracellular (neutrophil and other cells) glutathione stores and decreased HzO z production without a real change in plasma elastase concentrations (thus without altering neutrophil degranulation), possibly explaining its beneficial effects by the decreased neutrophil oxidant injury (58).\n\nThe increased understanding of the pathophysiology of ARDS that has been achieved over the last decade has led to several new pharmacological approaches for the prevention and management of ARDS. Based on in vitro information and animal models, many of these strategies are quite compelling. Nevertheless, to date, no specific pharmacologic approach for the prevention or treatment of ARDS has been validated conclusively in clinical trials. Active basic and clinical investigations are continuing (Table 3) (60).\n\nGram-negative sepsis is a frequent cause of ARDS and experimentally, the syndrome can be mimicked by the injection of bacterial endotoxin. The mechanism by which sepsis and endotoxin produce ARDS has not been settled.\n\nEndotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a glycolipid that constitutes the major portion of the outermost membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (61). LPS is an extremely The use ofN-acetylcysteine and Procysteine as antioxidant therapy in ARDS has met with modest and somewhat conflicting results in trials of ARDS patients. Further investigation will be necessary to clarify the usefulness of this approach.\n\nIn animal models of ARDS, PGE\\ reduces pulmonary hypertension, lessens the accumulation of pulmonary edema, improves gas exchange, and helps to reduce the release of damaging mediators (such as oxygen radicals and leukotreine B 4 ) from activated granulocytes. However these beneficial results apparently were not confirmed in a large multicenter randomized study.\n\nBeing currently evaluated by the NIH ARDS Treatment Network in a randomized and double-blind fashion Clinical trials testing this approach are being planned.\n\npotent toxin: macrophages can be activated at concentrations of LPS as low as 1 pglml.\n\nThe lipid A portion of LPS is conserved among Gram-negative bacteria and appears to be responsible for the biological toxicity of LPS (61,62). Three cloned molecules expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages are known to bind the lipid A moiety of LPS.\n\nThese include CDI4, the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR), and the P2 leukocyte integrins (CDlla/CDI8, CDllb/CDI8, and CDllc/CDI8). Both CD14 and P2 integrins are capable of initiating signals to cell, resulting in phagocyte activation, bacterial internalization (phagocytosis, endocytosis), and the activation of bactericidal defenses.\n\nThe scavenger receptor does not appear to function as a signaling receptor for LPS.\n\nLastly, CD14 and the p2leukocyte integrins interact with LPS in conjunction with bloodborne proteins that enhance their signaling capabilities. Both soluble CD14 (sCDI4) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) are present in blood and are known to enhance to effects of LPS.\n\nThe earliest cell-mediated events following endotoxin release appear to involve the transfer of LPS to the GPI-linked protein CDI4. LPS is an amphiphilic membrane phospholipid that forms aggregates in aqueous environments such as tissue culture medium or blood. Spontaneous diffusion of LPS monomers from these aggregates to CD14 occurs at a very slow rate (63). The plasma protein LBP (64), however, dramatically accelerates binding of LPS monomers from aggregates to CD14 (63), thereby enhancing the sensitivity of cells to LPS (63, 65 -67). Additional studies have shown that LBP can transfer LPS to lipoproteins (68). After transfer to lipoprotein particles, LPS is functionally neutralized (69 -72). Thus, LBP may serve to both enhance and neutralize the biological activities of LPS. LBP is an acute-phase reactant (64), predominantly derived from the liver, and plasma levels rise dramatically after inflammatory challenge (73 -75). LBP can also be synthesized in the lung and local production of LBP might account for many of its biological effects (76). No role for LBP has ever been established with respect to the CDIl1CD18 integrins, which may also participate in LPS signaling (77,78).\n\nFigure 3 summarizes the interactions of LPS that are known to be important for LPS-initiated activation of a wide variety of cell types. Among those cells that respond to LPS, there are two groups: those that express membrane-bound CD14 (mCDI4) and those that do not. Until recently, only myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils were known to express mCD14 (79), but recent evidence shows that mesangial cells express mCD14 ex vivo and other cells such as gingival fibroblasts may also express mCD 14 (80 -82). Some cells do not express mCD 14 but respond to LPS in the presence of the soluble plasma form of CD14 (sCDI4). These include endothelial and epithelial cells (83), smooth-muscle cells (84), astrocytes (85), and dendritic cells (86). It is interesting that in both pathways, LPS alone is less active as an agonist than is an LPSprotein complex (LPS-LBP for mCD14 bearing cells (66,88) and LPS-sCDI4 for the non-mCD14 bearing cells) (83). However irrespective of whether the cells express mCDI4, after interacting with the cells the LPS may partition between two paths, one leading to internalization and the other leading to cellular activation (87 -89).\n\nThe results of previous studies in this laboratory showed that calcium channel blockers (such as nicardipine) were highly effective in reducing endotoxin-induced mortality and suggested that the protective action of these agents was at least partly related to prevention of endotoxin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n\nStudies in our laboratory have also shown that PAF antagonists (such as bepafant), ibuprofen (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) and pentoxifylline exerted similar beneficial effects on endotoxin-induced DIC and mortality in rats. The objectives of the present investigation are to determine if these drugs can effectively protect the rat lung from the deleterious effect of endotoxin and to try to explore the possible role of PMN on endotoxin induced lung injury. Our working hypothesis is that these agents may prevent endotoxin induced ARDS and that the beneficial effect may be related to preventing PMN migration to lungs and/or to modulating release of mediators from PMNs.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nMale Wistar rats obtained from Simonsen weighing 300 -350g were used. After their arrival, the animals were kept in a room with a twelve-hour light and a twelve-hour dark cycle. All of the rats were allowed free access to food and water. All procedures used were in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal studies. E. coli endotoxin was given intravenously via a tail vein into unanesthetized rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Nicardipine (1 mg/kg), bepafant (1 mg/kg) and pentoxifylline (50 mg/kg) were given 15 minutes before the administration of endotoxin. The control groups were treated with an equivalent volume of normal saline instead of the agents described above.\n\nAfter injecting the chemicals and drugs described above, and waiting for 60 minutes, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg).\n\nSurgery was started about 10 minutes later. A tracheal cannula was inserted and the lungs were ventilated with a humidified gas mixture containing 5% CO 2 in room air at a frequency of 50 cycles/min, a tidal volume of 2 ml, and an end-expiratory pressure of 2 cm H20. After opening the chest, heparin sodium (1 unit/g body weight) was injected into the right ventricle. The pulmonary artery was cannulated and perfused with a physiological salt solution containing (in mM) 119 NaCI, 4.7 KCI, 1.17 MgS0\n\n4 , 22.6 NaHC03, 1.18 KH Z P04, 1.6 CaCh, 5.5 glucose, 50 sucrose and 4 g/100 ml Ficoll (MW 70,000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). A wide-bore cannula was inserted into the left ventricle to collect and drain the effluent perfusate into a reservoir, which was maintained at 37°C\n\nin a water bath. The first 50-ml of perfusate was discarded. The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc and placed on a double-level weighing pan, mounted on a Grass FT-03-C force displacement transducer for detecting the change of lung weight and for collecting accumulated fluid. The preparation was suspended in a humidified chamber and kept at a constant temperature (Figure 4). All fluid drained from the lung was collected in the lower pan. The preparation was perfused at a constant rate of 3 ml/min/l00g body weight by means of a roller pump. All cannulae were fixed in positions that had least effect on the weight of the lungs. The pulmonary arterial pressure and the pulmonary venous pressure (as represented by left atrial pressure) were continuously monitored using physiological pressure transducers. Recordings were made using a Beckman Dynograph.\n\nThe total vascular resistance (Rt) was computed as the ratio of the difference between pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary venous pressure (PVP) to the perfusion flow rate. Arterial resistance (Ra) is defined as the resistance contributed by vascular segments upstream to the microvasculature, whereas venous resistance (Rv) Humidified. 37°C\n\nPressure Transducer Ventilator Figure 4.

The colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma and the tissue fluid are represented by 1tp and 7th respectively.\n\nWe determined Kr by using the gravimetric method described by Drake et al (92).\n\nWhen isolated lung reaches an isogravimetric state, the PVP was rapidly elevated by The initial rate of fluid filtration can be estimated by extrapolating the slow component to zero time (Figure 5). The value of y-intercept was then divided by the change in microvascular pressure (~Pc), which is the driving pressure causing the fluid shift and the increase of lung weight,\n\nK f is expressed in units of ml per minute per centimeter of water per 100 gram of lung (ml/min/cmH z O/1 OOg). We estimate the initial lung weight (LW) of the rat from its body weight (BW) by the equation ( 93):\n\nLW= 0.05BW + 0.43 (6) During the hydrostatic challenge, Pc can not be measured directly with the venous occlusion method; hence, it is calculated by the equation of Gaar et al (94).\n\nAfter injecting the chemicals and drugs described above into rats, and waiting for 60 minutes, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg body weight). Surgery was started about 10 minutes later. The lungs were instilled via a tracheal cannula with 10% formalin at a pressure of 20 cmHzO for 5 minutes. After were divided by initial driving force (M>c, 10.5 cmHzO) and normalized by 100 g lung weight to yield a K f of 0.32 g/min/cmH z O/I00g lung weight (Adapted from Kunlun Huang (91»)  instillation, heart and lungs were removed en bloc and were kept in 10% formalin for about 24 hours. A mid-horizontal slice from the left lung was processed for light microscopic examination. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether these same agents (nicardipine, bepafant and pentoxifylline) would also have a protective effect against lung injury that endotoxin is known to produce. In the present experiments, we found that endotoxin (10 mglkg) given i.v. in rats produced pulmonary changes indicative of lung injury including increases in capillary permeability (K f ), lung weight, lung water content and the outflow of lung filtrate. The lipopolysaccharide also produced changes in pulmonary pressure and vascular dynamics, including increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary pressure and arterial and venous segmental resistances. Pretreatment with nicardipine (1.0 mglkg), bepafant (1.0 mglkg) and pentoxifylline, 15 minutes before endotoxin, significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced Increases In capillary permeability and the outflow of lung filtrate. Endotoxin also caused a significant increase in the leucocyte content of the lungs as compared to saline control animals. The increase was significantly reduced by pretreatment with nicardipine (1.0 mg/kg) and bepafant (1.0 mg/kg) but not with pentoxifylline (50 mg/kg).\n\nSeveral facets of the present study will be discussed below, including: (1) the nature of the endotoxin-induced changes in pulmonary dynamics and its modification by pretreatment with the three drugs; (2) the possible role of leucocytes in the pulmonary injury;\n\n(3) the possible mechanisms ofthe protective action of the three drugs.\n\nMany researchers have reported (195 -197) that an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance are features of the response to endotoxin in the rat pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary hypertension occurs mainly due to rise in cardiac output with little change in pulmonary vascular resistance after endotoxemia. Furthermore, this increase in pulmonary artery pressure is not due to back pressure from a dysfunctional left ventricle because left atrial pressure in general is not elevated in sepsis before volume resuscitation. Some clinical results show that the pulmonary artery diastolic-to-wedge pressure gradient is increased, suggesting upstream causes of vascular obstruction (101),\n\nThe causes of the elevations in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance after endotoxemia have not been clearly delineated. Possibilities for these changes include reduction in cross-sectional area due to vascular obstruction by thrombosis, plugging by leukocytes and platelets, vasoconstriction, edema, and airway changes that may over distend alveoli and compress the capillary bed. In addition, microatelectasis related to diffuse lung injury and surfactant abnormalities may elevate pulmonary vascular resistance by reducing the cross-sectional area because of collapse and crinkling of the alveolar walls. Vasoconstriction is another major potential cause of the increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Although pulmonary artery pressure in septic lung injury does not appear to correlate with clinical outcome, it is clear that a degree of active pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs in patients with septic lung injury (102).\n\nIn our experiments, endotoxin was given i.v. and one hour later, the lungs were isolated and perfused at a constant rate with a physiological saline solution containing\n\nFicoll, a substance used to substitute for albumin. The pulmonary arterial pressure, and segmental arterial and venous resistances, as well as the capillary pressure were found to be significantly higher in animals given endotoxin than in the saline controls. Capillary permeability (Kf) was also found to be increased. Since the rate of perfusion was kept constant in our experiments, the increased pulmonary arterial pressure could only have been caused by the observed increase in segmental arterial resistance. The segmental venous resistance was also increased by endotoxin. The former (increased arterial resistance) would be expected to cause a decrease in capillary pressure, while the latter (increased venous resistance) would increase the capillary pressure. The observed increase in capillary pressure is thus explicable on the basis that the increase in venous resistance was greater than the increase in arterial segmental resistance.\n\nLung weight, lung water content and the total outflow of lung filtrate at the end of the experiments (after a total of 55 to 60 minutes of perfusion) were significantly greater in lungs from endotoxin treated animals than from saline controls. The increased lung weight and lung water content are indicative of an increased amount of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium (pulmonary edema) while the increased outflow of lung filtrate would have been manifested by an increase in pulmonary lymph flow in the intact animal. These findings, which are indicative of loss of fluid from the capillaries, are attributable to both the increased capillary pressure and the increased capillary permeability (K f ) caused by the endotoxin.\n\nPretreatment with all three agents (nicardipine, bepafant and pentoxifylline) exerted a protective effect against the lung injury induced by endotoxin. Nicardipine and bepafant significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced increase in capillary permeability (K f ) without significantly affecting the endotoxin-induced changes in pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures or changes in vascular segmental resistances. Pentoxifylline differed from the other two drugs in that it inhibited the pulmonary hypertension and the increases in capillary pressure and vascular resistances as well as the increase in capillary permeability induced by the lipopolysaccharide.\n\nInhibition of the endotoxin-induced increase in capillary permeability by the three drugs was associated with a reduction in the total outflow of filtrate but not in the lung weight or lung water content. The latter were unexpected since a reduced permeability would be expected to reduce lung weight and lung water content as well as filtrate outflow. However, this may be explicable on the basis of dose-response relationships.\n\nThe dose of endotoxin used in our experiments produced a copious loss of fluid from the capillaries. The doses of the three agents that we employed were the same as the doses used in our previous studies on endotoxin-induced DIe. These doses were found to prevent most of the manifestations ofDIC and to significantly reduce mortality caused by the lipopolysaccharide. In the present study, the three drugs apparently were able to reduce the loss of capillary fluid to an extent such that it was manifested by a reduction in filtrate outflow but not lung weight or lung water content. It is likely that the drugs would have reduced all three parameters had a smaller dose of endotoxin or larger doses of the three drugs been used. Although pentoxifylline reduced the endotoxin-induced increase in capillary pressure, nicardipine and bepafant failed to have this effect. This may have dampened the ability of the latter two drugs to antagonize the endotoxin-induced loss of fluid from the capillaries.\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1 (Introduction), the pulmonary injury induced by endotoxin may be related to pulmonary sequestration and migration of neutrophils with subsequent degranulation and release of reactive oxygen species and enzymes that interact with endothelial cells, cytokines and complement components. In the present study, histological examination of lung tissue under high power light microscopy showed that endotoxin caused a significant increase in the number of leucocytes. While the method did not allow a differential count of the ~eucocytes, it is logical, on the basis of reports by other investigators, to speculate that the increase was at least partly if not mainly related to increased numbers of neutrophils. Nicardipine and bepafant were found to significantly reduce the endotoxin-induced increase in pulmonary leucocyte count.\n\nPentoxifylline failed to have such an effect. The protective effect of the former two agents, but not the latter, may thus in part be due to decreased pulmonary sequestion/migration of leucocytes.\n\nPentoxifylline IS a methylated xanthine derivative chemically related to theophylline and caffeine. It is a drug known to increase blood cell deformability and has been in clinical use for many years, especially in the treatment of intermittent claudication (103).\n\nLeukocytes, with a mean diameter of about 12 to 14 /lm, are much larger than the diameter of the capillary lumen (approximately 5 /lm). Despite the size discrepancy, unimpeded flow of leukocytes through the capillaries occurs because of the remarkable deformability of blood cells. Endotoxin can decrease this deformability of leukocytes (104). This may be one of the reasons why leukocytes are sequestrated in the lungs after the administration of endotoxin. Microvascular entrapment of leukocytes may be the initiating event for oxidative injury to endothelial and parenchymal cells. Previous results from our laboratory showed that pretreatment with pentoxifylline could improve blood cell deformability (99). In the present study, pretreatment with pentoxifylline was found to reduce the endotoxin-induced increases in pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary capillary pressure, vascular resistances, capillary permeability and outflow of lung filtrate. We considered the possibility of these salutary effects of pentoxifylline might be related to diminished endotoxin-induced pulmonary sequestration of leucocytes because of improved blood cell deformability. However, this did not prove to be the case since the drug did not affect the endotoxin-induced increase in leucocyte count.\n\nAnother important action of pentoxifylline is that it can inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE), an enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of cAMP to adenosine 5' monophosphate, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP levels (105). Elevation of cAMP in vascular smooth muscle causes vasodilation. In endothelial cells, increased cAMP levels can cause a decrease in capillary permeability by relaxing the endothelial cytoskeleton, thus decreasing the intercellular gaps ( 106). This may be a possible explanation for our observation that pentoxifylline inhibited the increase in capillary permeability induced by the lipopolysaccharide.\n\nPentoxifylline has been reported to down regulate the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) (107,108). The latter is a 17-kDa protein produced by macrophages and appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative shock. It increases neutrophil margination and activates monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Activated neutrophils can cause lung injury by releasing its contents, including enzymes and superoxide anions. TNF-a induces its own production and release, as well as those ofIL-l~and IL-6 (12). It can also up-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules including ICAM-l, P-selectin, and E-selectin, thereby increasing neutrophil--endothelium interactions (34, 109). Additionally, it can decrease the chemotactic ability and deformability of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Given as a purified preparation, TNF-a evokes most of the effects of LPS in animals, including fever, shock and death (llO). Passive immunization against TNF-a (111) or administration of chimeric TNF-a inhibitors (112 -1l4) have been reported to protect against the lethal effect ofTNF-a.\n\nPentoxifylline is inactive on endotoxin-induced IL-6 production and on TNFinduced thromboplastin activity in endothelial cells. Furthermore, it does not inhibit activation of endothelial cells by TNF-a. This latter action of TNF stimulates transendothelial migration of polymorphoneclear neutrophils (115). These observations thus suggest that endothelial cells are not a primary target of pentoxifylline (1l6).\n\nHowever, pentoxifylline inhibits TNF activation of leucocytes by down-regulating its production and thus increases the chemotactic movement of leukocytes. This may therefore result in the trapping of leukocytes in the lungs and may be the reason why there is no significant decrease in leukocyte numbers in pentoxifylline pretreated animals as compared with the endotoxin controls, despite the fact that the drug decreases blood cell deformability.\n\nPentoxifylline also appears to have an anti-inflammatory action. Cermak, et al. (117) found pentoxifylline to inhibit the synthesis of C-reactive protein. The latter is an inflammatory acute-phase reactant which stimulates the production of tissue factor by monocytes. A decrease in tissue factor levels may be beneficial when inflammation is complicated by thrombosis.\n\nBepafant (WEB 2170) is a PAF (platelet-activating factor) receptor antagonist.\n\nMany antagonists of the PAF receptor have been described including compounds that are structural analogs as well as others without any structural relationship to PAF. A number of natural PAF antagonists have been identified, including BN 52021 and kadsurenone.\n\nMore recently, several synthetic PAF receptor antagonists were also developed. They include 1) phospholipid analogs; 2) tetrahydrofuran derivatives; and 3) triazolobenzodiazepine derivatives such as WEB 2086, WEB 2170, BN 50726, and BN 50739.\n\nPAF is one of most potent and versatile mediators found in mammals. The compound is thought to be a mediator of cell-to-cell communication and to function either as an intercellular or an intracellular messenger (118). Numerous cell types and tissues have been shown to produce PAF upon appropriate stimulation (119). In particular, PAF is produced by a variety of cells that may participate in inflammatory reactions, including monocytes/macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), eosinophils, basophils, and platelets (120 -123). In addition, human endothelial cells were found to produce PAF after stimulation by a myriad of inflammatory mediators including thrombin (124 -127), angiotensin II (124), vasopressin (124), leukotrienes C 4 and D 4 (128), histamine (128), bradykinin (128\\ elastase (129), cathepsin G (129), hydrogen peroxide (130, 131\\ plasmin (132,133), interleukin (IL)-8 (134) and IL-1P, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (135)(136)(137)(138)(139)(140)(141), Most of the cells that produce PAF also possess PAF receptors (142 -145) and are targets for PAF action. In addition to activating platelets, PAF promotes the aggregation, chemotaxis, granule secretion, and oxygen radical generation from leukocytes as well as the adherence of leukocytes to the endothelium (146 -150). PAF increases the permeability of single layer endothelial cells in vitro (151) and stimulates smooth muscle contraction (152 -154) PAF has also been found to stimulate the release of arachidonic acid in various cell types by different mechanisms (155 -159). Furthermore, PAF induces an elevation of cytosolic free calcium in several cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells (160,   161). The two main mechanisms involved in PAF-induced increase in cytosolic free calcium are 1) the mobilization of calcium from the intracellular stores as a result of inositol trisphosphate generation and 2) the influx of extracellular calcium through a membrane-associated channel, regulated either directly by PAF or indirectly by intracellular second messenger such as lipoxygenase-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid (118).\n\nOur present data showed that pretreatment with bepafant inhibited the endotoxininduced increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. This finding is in agreement with the observations by Leonardo et al. (162) that PAF-induced pulmonary edema in rats can be inhibited by PAF antagonists. Additionally, PAF has been reported to enhance the permeability of cultured single layer of human endothelial cell and induce changes of the cell cytoskeleton leading to cell retraction and formation of intercellular gaps (151). PAF receptor antagonists inhibited these effects.\n\nBochenski et al. (163) showed both PAF and thromboxane A 2 mediated the rise in pulmonary arterial pressure caused by LPS; On the other hand, the LPS-induced fall in systemic arterial pressure is mediated by PAF. The PAF antagonist, bepafant, attenuated the systemic hypotension but was a weaker protector against LPS-induced pulmonary hypertension. These results are consonant with our observations that bepafant had no effect on the endotoxin induced increases in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistances.\n\nAt least three distinct mechanisms may be responsible for contraction of vascular Our present data showed that nicardipine did not inhibit the increased pulmonary vascular resistance caused by endotoxin. The drug is a dihydropyridine derivative, a class of calcium channel blockers that is vasoselective. Neely, et al. (164) found that the more vasoselective the calcium channel blocker, the greater is its effect on pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, calcium channel blockers are not selective for the pulmonary vascular bed. They are less effective in producing pulmonary vasodilatation than many other vasodilator drugs, including prostaglandin E 1 , isoproterenol, prostacyclin, and nitroglycerin. Moreover, the effect of vasoselective calcium channel blockers on pulmonary vascular resistance is secondary to the effects of these agents on systemic vascular resistance.\n\nMany researchers (165 -180) report that sepsis/endotoxemia produces an increase in [Ca 2 +]i and that this may be due to multiple factors and may be different, depending on the cell type. Evidence exists that transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i are essential for migration of neutrophils (PMNs) (181) and calcium antagonists have been reported to inhibit the ability ofPMNs to migrate to and destroy pathogens (182 -184). Our finding that nicardipine reduced the endotoxin-induced pulmonary leucocyte count is consonant with these reports.\n\nIn addition to reducing PMN mobility, calcium antagonists can prevent the oxidative burst that is necessary for killing of some types of bacteria (182,183). In experiments on LPS-stimulated PMNs, both calcium channel blockers and drugs that inhibit Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores decreased superoxide anion production by more than 50 percent (184).\n\nCalcium antagonists can also decrease production or release of cytokines. The study of Fukuzawa et al (185) showed nicardipine has an inhibitory effect on the in vivo production of TNF-a, The mechanism of the latter effect is not clear but may relate to inhibition of phosphodiesterase by nicardipine. Drugs that increase cAMP level in mononuclear cells are known to suppress TNF-a production. Thus, nicardipine may be similar to pentoxifylline in this regard.\n\nCalcium regulation of IL-l formation has been extensively investigated. While it has been reported that a calcium-mediated process was central in the production IL-l (186- 188>, other reports concluded that calcium had no role in the induction or release of IL-l (189). There is evidence that Ca 2 + is involved in the production of a number of other cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, etc (190 -193), Some calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, were found to inhibit IL-6 promoter activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (185). IL-6 is produced by activated macrophages and stimulates acute-phase responses in the liver. IL-6 production is induced in part by TNF-a and IL-IB and it has been proposed that IL-6 \"integrates\" signals produced early in the inflammatory response (194).\n\nConsequently, it is possible that drugs which decrease [Ca 2 +]i may exert a more global dampening effect on cytokines than a single cytokine antagonist.\n\nA review of the literature reveals that the pathophysiology of endotoxin-induced lung injury is highly complex and incompletely understood and appears to be multifactorial, with neutrophils playing a central role. Pentoxifylline (an agent that increases blood cell deformability), bepafant (a PAF antagonist) and nicardipine (a calcium channel blocker) were observed to exert a beneficial action against the lung injury induced by the lipopolysaccharide. In previous studies, pretreatment with the three drugs was found to reduce endotoxin-induced mortality as well as to prevent most of the manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The present results suggest that a protective effect on the lungs may also contribute to the salutary effect of these agents on endotoxin-induced lethality. The mechanism(s) by which these agents exert this protective effect in the lungs is not clear. The results with nicardipine and bepafant suggest that these agents may in part act by inhibiting the pulmonary migration/sequestration of leucocytes. Based on what is known in the literature, it is also possible to postulate a number of other ways by which these drugs might exert their beneficial action. These are illustrated in figure 45.\n\nEndotoxin I ... Monocyte/macrophage ... activation (-) Pentoxifylline ~Nicardipine ..
