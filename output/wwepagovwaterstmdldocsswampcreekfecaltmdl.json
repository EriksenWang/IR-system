    "full_text": "This report presents the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for fecal coliforms for Swamp Creek, located in the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin. The creek was verified as impaired for fecal coliforms, and was included on the Verified List of impaired waters for the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin that was adopted by Secretarial Order in June 2008. This TMDL establishes the allowable loadings to Swamp Creek that would restore this waterbody so that it meets its applicable water quality criteria for fecal coliforms.\n\nThe entire Swamp Creek watershed stretches from Grady County, Georgia, to the south, with a total length of about 6 miles and a total drainage area of 57.4 square miles (mi 2 ) (Figure 1.1).\n\nThe Florida portion of the watershed is located in Gadsden County, Florida. Its 11.34 mi 2 drainage area extends from the Florida-Georgia state line to the south, where it converges with Attapulgus Creek to help form the Little River (Figure 1.2). Swamp Creek is a second-order stream that receives water from Mill Creek, as well as several other small tributaries. Both waterbodies are fed by the Floridan aquifer. Additional information about Swamp Creek's hydrology and geology are available in the Basin Status Report for the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin (Florida Department of Environmental Protection [Department], 2001).\n\nFor assessment purposes, the Department has divided the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin into water assessment polygons with a unique waterbody identification (WBID) number for each watershed or stream reach. The Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin has been divided into numerous segments, as shown in Figure 1.3. This TMDL addresses primarily Swamp Creek (WBID 427).\n\n1 Florida Department of Environmental Protection Figure 1.2. Swamp Creek Watershed in Florida, and Major Geopolitical Features 3 Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\nThis report was developed as part of the Department's watershed management approach for restoring and protecting state waters and addressing TMDL Program requirements. The watershed approach, which is implemented using a cyclical management process that rotates through the state's 52 river basins over a 5-year cycle, provides a framework for implementing the TMDL Program-related requirements of the 1972 federal Clean Water Act and the 1999 Florida Watershed Restoration Act (FWRA) (Chapter 99-223, Laws of Florida) (also see Appendix A for background information on the federal and state stormwater programs).\n\nA TMDL represents the maximum amount of a given pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet water quality standards, including its applicable water quality criteria and its designated uses. TMDLs are developed for waterbodies that are verified as not meeting their water quality standards. They provide important water quality restoration goals that will guide restoration activities.\n\nThis TMDL report will be followed by the development and implementation of a Basin Management Action Plan, or BMAP, to reduce the amount of fecal coliforms that caused the verified impairment of Swamp Creek. These activities will depend heavily on the active participation of the Northwest Florida Water Management District (NWFWMD), local governments, businesses, and other stakeholders. The Department will work with these organizations and individuals to undertake or continue reductions in the discharge of pollutants and achieve the established TMDLs for impaired waterbodies.\n\nChapter 2: DESCRIPTION OF WATER QUALITY PROBLEM 2.1 Statutory Requirements and Rulemaking History Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act requires states to submit to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a list of surface waters that do not meet applicable water quality standards (impaired waters) and establish a TMDL for each pollutant causing the impairment of listed waters on a schedule. The Department has developed such lists, commonly referred to as 303(d) lists, since 1992. The list of impaired waters in each basin, referred to as the Verified List, is also required by the FWRA (Subsection 403.067[4], Florida Statutes [F.S.]), and the state's 303(d) list is amended annually to include basin updates. Florida's 1998 303(d) list included 24 waterbodies in the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin. However, the FWRA (Section 403.067, F.S.) stated that all previous Florida 303(d) lists were for planning purposes only and directed the Department to develop, and adopt by rule, a new science-based methodology to identify impaired waters. After a long rulemaking process, the Environmental Regulation Commission adopted the new methodology as Rule 62-303, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (Identification of Impaired Surface Waters Rule, or IWR), in April 2001; the rule was updated in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe Department used the IWR to assess water quality impairments in the Ochlockonee-St. Marks Basin and has verified the impairments listed in\n\nTable 2.1. Table 2.2 provides selected assessment results for fecal coliforms within the verification period for Swamp Creek Watershed, which was January 1, 2000, through June 30, 2007.\n\nThis TMDL addresses the fecal coliforms impairment in Swamp Creek, WBID 427. There were a total of 35 fecal coliforms samples collected within the verified period. The samples used in the TMDL calculation range from 21 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (cfu/100mL) to 5,100 cfu/100mL.\n\nTable 2.3 briefly summarizes the fecal coliforms data for Swamp Creek. 6 Florida Department of Environmental Protection Table 2.3.

DESCRIPTION OF APPLICABLE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND TARGETS 3.1 Classification of the Waterbody and Criteria Applicable to the TMDL Florida's surface waters are protected for five designated use classifications, as follows: Class I Potable water supplies Class II Shellfish propagation or harvesting Class III Recreation, propagation, and maintenance of a healthy, wellbalanced population of fish and wildlife Class IV Agricultural water supplies Class V Navigation, utility, and industrial use (there are no state waters currently in this class)\n\nThe Swamp Creek Watershed contains a number of Class III fresh waterbodies-i.e., Swamp Creek, Mill Creek, and several other small tributaries. Class III waterbodies have a designated use of recreation, propagation, and the maintenance of a healthy, well-balanced population of fish and wildlife. The water quality criterion applicable to the impairment addressed by this TMDL is the Class III criterion for fecal coliforms.\n\nNumeric criteria for bacterial quality are expressed in terms of fecal coliforms bacteria concentrations. The water quality criterion for the protection of Class III waters, as established by Rule 62-302, F.A.C., states the following:\n\nThe most probable number (MPN) or membrane filter (MF) counts per 100 mL of fecal coliforms bacteria shall not exceed a monthly average of 200, nor exceed 400 in 10 percent of the samples, nor exceed 800 on any one day.\n\nThe criterion states that monthly averages shall be expressed as geometric means based on a minimum of 10 samples taken over a 30-day period. However, during the development of load curves for the impaired waterbody (as described in subsequent sections); there were insufficient data (fewer than 10 samples in a given month) available to evaluate the geometric mean criterion for fecal coliforms bacteria. Therefore, the criterion selected for the TMDL was not to exceed 400 in 10 percent of the samples.\n\nChapter 4: ASSESSMENT OF SOURCES\n\nAn important part of the TMDL analysis is the identification of pollutant source categories, source subcategories, or individual sources of nutrients in the watershed and the amount of pollutant loading contributed by each of these sources. Sources are broadly classified as either \"point sources\" or \"nonpoint sources.\" Historically, the term \"point sources\" has meant discharges to surface waters that typically have a continuous flow via a discernable, confined, and discrete conveyance, such as a pipe. Domestic and industrial wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) are examples of traditional point sources. In contrast, the term \"nonpoint sources\" was used to describe intermittent, rainfall-driven, diffuse sources of pollution associated with everyday human activities, including runoff from urban land uses, agriculture, silviculture, and mining; discharges from failing septic systems; and atmospheric deposition.\n\nHowever, the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act redefined certain nonpoint sources of pollution as point sources subject to regulation under the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program. These nonpoint sources included certain urban stormwater discharges, including those from local government master drainage systems, construction sites over five acres, and a wide variety of industries (see Appendix A for background information on the federal and state stormwater programs).\n\nTo be consistent with Clean Water Act definitions, the term \"point source\" will be used to describe traditional point sources (such as domestic and industrial wastewater discharges) and stormwater systems requiring an NPDES stormwater permit when allocating pollutant load reductions required by a TMDL (see Section 6.1). However, the methodologies used to estimate nonpoint source loads do not distinguish between NPDES stormwater discharges and non-NPDES stormwater discharges, and as such, this source assessment section does not make any distinction between the two types of stormwater.\n\nThere is currently one permitted wastewater treatment facility in the Florida portion of the Swamp Creek watershed that discharges a load either directly or indirectly into the watershed (Figure 4.1). Coastal Forest Resources Company -Havana Plywood has two permits (FLA010091 and FLR05A004), which allow the facility to discharge into the watershed (Table 4.1). Appendix C summarizes the facility's discharge. One permitted facility in Georgia also discharges into the watershed (Table 4.1).\n\nThere are currently no NPDES municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permittees in the watershed.\n\n11 Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\nPotentially all of the fecal Coliforms loadings to the Swamp Creek Watershed are generated from nonpoint sources in the watershed. Potential nonpoint sources of Coliformss include loadings from surface runoff, wildlife, livestock, pets, and leaking septic tanks.\n\nThe spatial distribution and acreage of different land use categories were identified using the 1995 NWFWMD land use coverage (scale 1:40,000) contained in the Department's geographic information system (GIS) library.  2008), the population density in and around the Swamp Creek Watershed in the year 2000 was at or less than 87.4 people/mi 2 (10 persons/mi 2 is the minimum used by the Census Bureau) (Figure 4.3). The Bureau reports that for Gadsden County, which includes WBIDs 427 and 428, the total population for 2000 was 45,087, and the county has 15,867 occupied housing units and 17,703 total housing units. For all of Gadsden County, the Census Bureau reported a housing density of 34.3 housing units/mi 2 , placing Gadsden County among the lowest in housing densities in Florida (U.S. Census Bureau Website, 2008). This is also supported by land use coverage, which shows that only 9.64 percent of land use in the Swamp Creek Watershed is delineated as urban and built-up.\n\nOn-site sewage treatment and disposal systems (OSTDS's), including septic tanks, are commonly used where providing central sewer is not cost-effective or practical. When properly sited, designed, constructed, maintained, and operated, OSTDS's are a safe means of disposing of domestic waste. The effluent from a well-functioning OSTDS is comparable to secondarily treated wastewater from a sewage treatment plant. When not functioning properly, OSTDS's can be a source of coliforms, pathogens, and other pollutants to both ground water and surface water.\n\nNo measured septic tank failure rate data were available for the watershed at the time this TMDL analysis was conducted. Therefore the failure rate was derived from the number of septic tanks and septic tank repair permits for the county published by the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) (http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/OSTDS/statistics/ostdsstatistics.htm) (Table 4.3a). As of 2007, Gadsden County had roughly 16,381 septic systems (FDOH Website, 2008). Data for septic tanks are based on 1970 to 2007 Census results, with year-by-year additions based on new septic tank construction permits. The data do not reflect septic tanks that have been removed going back to 1970. From fiscal years 1991 to 2007, 1,761 permits for repairs were issued (FDOH Website, 2008).\n\nBased on the number of permitted septic tanks and housing units located in the county, approximately 8 percent of the housing units are connected to a wastewater treatment facility, with the remaining 92 percent using septic tank systems. Using the FDOH information, a discovery rate of failed septic tanks for each year between 2000 and 2005 was calculated and listed in Table 4.3a. Using the table, the average annual septic tank failure discovery rate for Gadsden County is about 0.60 percent. Assuming that failed septic tanks are not discovered for about 5 years, the estimated annual septic tank failure rate is about 5 times the discovery rate, or 3 percent. The Swamp Creek Watershed comprises 11.34 mi 2 , or approximately 2.15 percent of the total land area of Gadsden County (528.13 mi 2 ). The number of septic tanks in the watershed is not known, but using the ratio of Level 1 urban and built-up land use in the watershed to that in Gadsden County (1.9511E-02), the number of septic tanks in the watershed (N) is estimated to be about 32. Using this number, and 70 gallons/day/person (EPA, 2001), the discharge rate from each septic tank (Q) was calculated by multiplying the average household size by the per capita wastewater production rate per day.\n\nBased on the information published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the average household size for Gadsden County is about 2.6 people/household. The same population density was assumed for the Swamp Creek watershed. Assuming the above, a loading of 1.325 X 10 10 colonies/day to the watershed is derived. These estimations, as shown in\n\nSanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) can also be a potential source of fecal bacteria pollution. Human sewage can be introduced into surface waters even when storm and sanitary sewers are separated. Leaks and overflows are common in many older sanitary sewers where capacity is exceeded, high rates of infiltration and inflow occur (i.e., outside water gets into pipes, reducing capacity), frequent blockages occur, or sewers are simply falling apart due to poor joints or pipe materials. Power failures at pumping stations are also a common cause of SSOs.\n\nThe greatest risk of an SSO occurs during storm events; however, few comprehensive data are available to quantify SSO frequency and bacteria loads in most watersheds.\n\nFecal coliform loading from sewer line leakage can be calculated, based on the number of people in the watershed, typical per household generation rates, and the typical fecal coliform concentration in domestic sewage and assuming a leakage rate of 5 percent (Culver et al., 2002). Based on these assumptions, a rough estimate of fecal coliform loads from leaks and overflows of sanitary sewer lines in the Swamp Creek watershed is equal to 4.339E+10 (see Appendix B for the full septic loading table ).\n\nAnother potential nonpoint source of coliforms includes livestock and other agricultural animals.\n\nTable 4.4a summarizes cattle populations (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2002) in Gadsden County in 2002, and Table 4.4b summarizes populations of other agricultural animals in the county in 2002. Gadsden County is ranked as one of the lowest in the state in terms of the total number of cattle and calves and beef cows. Approximately 14.69 percent of the Swamp Creek Watershed is specifically categorized as agriculture under the Level 1 land use system. Table 4.4b. Summary of Agricultural Animal Populations (Excluding Cattle) Livestock Year 2002 Inventory Sold Hogs and Pigs 551 Poultry Layers and pullets 20 weeks and older 70 Broilers Sheep and Lambs 66 Horses 500 5 Milk Goats Goats, except Angora and Milk Ducks 22 Geese 25 Pheasants 6 Other Poultry Mules, Burros, and Donkeys 14 Rabbits Source: USDA, 2002.\n\nAnother possible source of fecal coliform bacteria in the Swamp Creek Watershed could be pets or domestic animals. The Department has been unable to obtain data on the number of dogs in the area; however, estimates can be made using literature-based values of dog ownership rates. Using dog to household ratio estimates from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) (2007), the approximate loading to the watershed from dogs is 8.98E+11 counts per day. Similarly, the number of horses and ponies can be estimated for a load of 6.50E+09 counts per day. The estimated total domestic animal load (excluding cats) is 9.04E+11 counts per day, which is 12.9 percent of the total internal load.\n\nThere are currently no houseboats in the Swamp Creek Watershed.\n\nThe most recent TMDL work (Benham, 2007) quantifying wildlife contributions to fecal coliform divides the load among eight categories of wildlife: deer, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, geese, ducks, wild turkeys, and other. Wildlife are assigned to a habitat they would normally frequent. For example, beaver, geese, and ducks are assigned to a buffer 91 meters wide along the perimeter of main streams and impoundments, while deer are assigned to the entire watershed. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) (Knight, 2003) notes that there are 5 major wildlife areas along several tributaries used for shellfish harvesting in Escambia County. The white-tailed deer population has been estimated (Department, 1998) at various densities (12.8/mi 2 ), as shown in Appendix B. Migratory waterfowl and other bird populations have been estimated annually from 1998 through 2006 (BirdSource Website, 2007). The value used for bird density (0.44/mi 2 ) is a composite of the largest species by size for the county. The total load from wildlife is estimated as 1.4176E+13 counts per day, or 9.08 percent of the total.\n\nThe Florida Department of Community Affairs (FDCA) ( 2007) maintains a Website (www.eoconline.org) that lists pollutant spills by date, time, county, reported amount, and description. Pollutants may be wastewater, petroleum, or other types of waste. Using the annual estimate of gallons spilled and a fecal concentration corresponding to raw sewage, an estimate of annual loading can be made. However, at this time, basin-specific data are not available to make this calculation.\n\nTable 4.5 summarizes the daily average fecal coliform loadings (from 1997 to 2006) from runoff, septic tank leakage, wildlife, and livestock in the Swamp Creek watershed, and Table 4.6.b summarizes external loads to the watershed (see Appendix D for additional details). Table 4.5. Estimated Average Daily Quantity of Internal Fecal Coliform Loads to the Swamp Creek Watershed, 1997-2006 Nonpoint Source Category Internal Loads to Swamp Creek Watershed % of Total Load Total Livestock 1.28E+13 9.19E+01 Total Wildlife 6.54E+10 4.71E-01 Total Domestic Animals (Excluding Cats) 9.04E+11 6.52E+00 Total Septic 1.53E+11 1.11E+00 Total 1.39E+13 1.00E+02 Tables 4.6a and 4.6b display the estimated external load entering the Swamp Creek watershed from Georgia. Table 4.6a summarizes the fecal coliform data used in calculating the TMDL for Swamp Creek above the state line, and Table 4.6b displays the estimated load as well as the percent reduction needed to restore the Georgia portion of Swamp Creek to meet the Georgia criteria.  The information provided in this chapter consists of estimates and is presented for reference purposes to help guide the BMAP process. It was not used in the percent reduction calculation of this TMDL.\n\nChapter 5: DETERMINATION OF ASSIMILATIVE CAPACITY\n\nThe methodology used for this TMDL was the \"percent reduction\" methodology. The Department generally prefers to use the load duration curve or \"Kansas\" method for coliform TMDLs, but this method could not be used because there are no stream gauging stations on Swamp Creek. To determine the TMDL, the percent reduction that would be required for each of the exceedances to meet applicable criteria was determined, and the median value of all of these reductions for both fecal determined the overall required reduction, and therefore the TMDL.\n\nSeven sampling stations in the Florida portion of the Swamp Creek Watershed have coliform observations. The primary data collector of data was the Department. The seven sampling stations were sampled between January 14, 1992, through and September 11, 2007. The EPA, Biological Research Associates, and the NWFWMD conducted additional sampling. Figure 5.1 shows the locations of these sites, and Tables 5.1a and 5.1b provide a brief statistical overview of the observed data at these sites.\n\nIn addition, Figure 5.2 shows a graphical display of the recent data points that were collected between January 14, 1992, and the present. Of the 35 recent samples collected, 12 samples exceeded the 400 cfu/100mL fecal coliform criterion. The Department conducted special sampling of Swamp Creek and its tributaries and wells (Wieckowicz, 2005).\n\n24 Florida Department of Environmental Protection . 25 Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\nExceedances of the state criterion were compared with the criterion of 400 counts/100mL. For each individual exceedance, an individual required reduction was calculated using the following:\n\n(1) [(observed value) -(state criterion)] x 100 (observed value)\n\nAfter the individual results were calculated, the median of the individual values was calculated, which is 69.23 percent. This means that in order to meet the state criterion of 400 counts/100mL, a 69.23 percent reduction in current loading is necessary, and this would therefore be the TMDL for Swamp Creek. Table 5.2 shows the individual reduction calculations for Swamp Creek, including all exceedances, and Table 5.1.b summarizes the data used in the calculation of the TMDL.\n\nThe critical condition for coliform loadings in a given watershed depends on many factors, including the presence of point sources and the land use pattern in the watershed. Typically, the critical condition for nonpoint sources is an extended dry period followed by a rainfall runoff event. During the wet weather period, rainfall washes off coliform bacteria that have built up on the land surface under dry conditions, resulting in the wet weather exceedances. However, significant nonpoint source contributions can also appear under dry conditions without any major surface runoff event. This usually happens when nonpoint sources contaminate the surficial aquifer, and fecal coliform bacteria are brought into the receiving waters through baseflow. In addition, as described above, livestock that have direct access to the receiving water can also contribute to the exceedance during dry weather. The critical condition for point source loading typically occurs during periods of low stream flow, when dilution is minimized.\n\nChapter 6: DETERMINATION OF THE TMDL\n\nThe objective of a TMDL is to provide a basis for allocating acceptable loads among all of the known pollutant sources in a watershed so that appropriate control measures can be implemented and water quality standards achieved. A TMDL is expressed as the sum of all point source loads (wasteload allocations, or WLAs), nonpoint source loads (load allocations, or LAs), and an appropriate margin of safety (MOS), which takes into account any uncertainty concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water quality:\n\nAs discussed earlier, the WLA is broken out into separate subcategories for wastewater discharges and stormwater discharges regulated under the NPDES Program:\n\nIt should be noted that the various components of the revised TMDL equation may not sum up to the value of the TMDL because (a) the WLA for NPDES stormwater is typically based on the percent reduction needed for nonpoint sources and is also accounted for within the LA, and (b) TMDL components can be expressed in different terms (for example, the WLA for stormwater is typically expressed as a percent reduction, and the WLA for wastewater is typically expressed as mass per day).\n\nWLAs for stormwater discharges are typically expressed as \"percent reduction\" because it is very difficult to quantify the loads from MS4s (given the numerous discharge points) and to distinguish loads from MS4s from other nonpoint sources (given the nature of stormwater transport). The permitting of stormwater discharges also differs from the permitting of most wastewater point sources. Because stormwater discharges cannot be centrally collected, monitored, and treated, they are not subject to the same types of effluent limitations as wastewater facilities, and instead are required to meet a performance standard of providing treatment to the \"maximum extent practical\" through the implementation of best management practices (BMPs).\n\nThis approach is consistent with federal regulations (40 CFR § 130.2[I]), which state that TMDLs can be expressed in terms of mass per time (e.g., pounds per day), toxicity, or other appropriate measure. The TMDL for the Swamp Creek Watershed is expressed in terms of percent reduction, and represents the maximum annual fecal coliform load the watershed can assimilate and maintain the fecal coliform criterion (Table 6.1).\n\nBased on a load duration curve approach similar to that developed by Kansas (Stiles, 2002), a fecal coliform reduction of 69.23 percent is needed from nonpoint sources in the Swamp Creek Watershed. It should be noted that the LA includes loading from stormwater discharges regulated by the Department and the water management districts that are not part of the NPDES Stormwater Program (see Appendix A). The daily LA for the Swamp Creek watershed is also a reduction of 69.23 percent.\n\nCurrently, there are two point source permitted NPDES wastewater discharges in the watershed. Any new potential discharger is expected to comply with the Class III criterion for coliform bacteria.\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are currently two permitted wastewater facilities with a discharge permit in the Swamp Creek Watershed. These facilities are not known to be sources of fecal coliform bacteria. Any new potential discharger is expected to comply with the Class III criterion for coliform bacteria.\n\nThere are currently no NPDES MS4 permits in the Swamp Creek watershed.\n\nConsistent with the recommendations of the Allocation Technical Advisory Committee (Department, 2001), an implicit MOS was used in the development of this TMDL. An implicit MOS was provided by the conservative decisions associated with a number of modeling assumptions and the development of assimilative capacity.\n\nFor fecal coliform, an implicit MOS was inherently incorporated by using 400 MPN/100mL of fecal coliform as the water quality target for each and every sampling event, instead of no more than 10 percent of the samples exceeding 400 MPN/100mL. For fecal coliform TMDLs, using the correlation lines fitting through only the existing loadings that exceeded the allowable loadings could overestimate the actual existing loading, which makes the estimation more conservative and therefore adds to the MOS. An additional MOS was included in the TMDL by not allowing any exceedances of the state criterion, even though intermittent natural exceedances of the criterion would be expected and would be taken into account when determining impairment.\n\n13.6949 2.5930867 0 0 4000 UPLAND FORESTS 364.3199 68.98284 4.6654 64.54621 5000 WATER 14.3015 2.7079445 0.1303 1.802712 6000 WETLANDS 28.3987 5.3772055 0.9241 12.785 7000 BARREN LAND 0.0821 0.0155454 0 0 8000 TRANSPORTATION AND UTILITIES 4.8674 0.9216271 0.0032 0.044272 TOTAL LAND 513.8297 97.292055 7.0977 98.19729 TOTAL LAND+WATER 528.1312 100 7.228 100 TOTAL CENSUS 2003 528.49 10.3114904 URBAN RATIO WBID/COUNTY 1 0.01951123 AGRICULTURE RATIO WBID/COUNTY 1 0.0123036 NATURAL RATIO WBID/COUNTY 1 0.01354395 TOTAL SEPTIC TANKS THRU 2005 16381 319.613472 TOTAL REPAIRS 1991 THRU 2005 1761 34.3592775 TOTAL FAILURES 819.05 15.9806736 TOTAL 2000 HOUSEHOLDS 15867 309.5847 TOTAL HOUSEBOATS TOTAL 1990 PUBLIC SEWER 6046 117.964902 TOTAL 1990 SEPTIC 8455 164.967457 TOTAL 1990 OTHER 358 6.98502064 TOTAL 2000 POPULATION 45087 879.702865 GADSDEN COUNTY FL SWAMP CREEK 37 Florida Department of Environmental Protection ) Animals in Swamp Swamp Creek Creek Watershed Watershed (cts/day) Geese Sold 4.90E+10 528.1312 7.228 0 0 Emus (~Geese) 4.90E+10 528.1312 C,E 7.228 0 0 Ostriches (~Geese) 4.90E+10 528.1312 C,E 7.228 0 0 Pheasants (~Geese) Inventory 4.90E+10 6 528.1312 C,E 7.228 0.073822 3.617E+09 Pheasants (~Geese) Sold 4.90E+10 528.1312 7.228 0 0 Pigeons or Squab Inventory 1.60E+08 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Pigeons or Squab Sold 1.60E+08 528.1312 7.228 0 0 Quail (~Pigeon) 1.60E+08 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Other 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Rabbits Inventory 2.53E+09 528.1312 J,K 7.228 0 0 Rabbits Sold 2.53E+09 528.1312 J,K 7.228 0 0 TOTAL LIVESTOCK 528.1312 C 7.228 0 1.275E+13 WILDLIFE 528.1312 C 7.228 Alligators 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Black Bears 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Raccoons 1.25E+08 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Beavers 2.50E+08 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Deer 5.00E+08 8702 528.1312 CI 7.228 117.8595 5.893E+10 Dolphin, Porpoise, Manatee 528.1312 C 7.228 0 0 Waterfowl 4.90E+10 9.7513 528.1312 CI 7.228 0.132071 6.471E+09 Wild Pigs 1.08E+10 528.1312 CI 7.228 0 0 TOTAL WILDLIFE 528.1312 C 7.228 6.54E+10 DOMESTIC ANIMALS 528.1312 C 7.228 Dogs 5.00E+09 4638.84 528.1312 0.58*HH F 7.228 179.5591 8.978E+11 Cats 5.00E+09 5278.68 528.1312 0.66*HH F 7.228 204.3259 1.022E+12 Horses and Ponies-Pets 4.20E+08 399.9 528.1312 0.05*HH F 7.228 15.47923 6.501E+09 TOTAL DOMESTIC 528.1312 7.228 9.043E+11 SEPTIC-HUMAN IMPACTS 528.1312 7.228 Human 2.00E+09 528.1312 7.228 Sewer Line Leaks 6.89E+09 528.1312 7.228 4.34E+10 for fecal coliform, Table A-16 (Georgia Environmental Protection Division, 2006).
