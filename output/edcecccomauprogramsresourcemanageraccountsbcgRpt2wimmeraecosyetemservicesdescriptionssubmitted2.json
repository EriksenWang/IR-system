    "full_text": "Bioregions is a large research project conducted in partnership with The Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research, Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (ARI), CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems (CSE) and the Birchip Cropping Group (BCG) with NHT and NAP funding through the North Central and Mallee Catchment Management Authorities (CMA). The project has delivered:\n\n• A literature review encompassing the landscape, land-use and vegetation histories of the region,\n\n• A landscape overview of ecosystem function in the region,\n\n• Landscape restoration options focusing on remnant vegetation,\n\n• A detailed inventory of the ecosystem services provided by remnant vegetation, and\n\n• A conceptual framework describing the interactions of the inventoried ecosystem services and native vegetation assets (natural capital) including how changes in vegetation condition affect the delivery of ecosystem service.\n\nReferences for these project outputs are found within the Further Reading section at the end of this document.\n\nThe ecosystem services valued by a diversity of Wimmera-Mallee community members were inventoried through a workshop process documented in a separate CSIRO consultancy report to the ARI (see references at the end of this document).\n\nThis report describes these services and their interactions with native vegetation within a conceptual framework developed by CSIRO's Ecosystem Services Project (http://www.cse.csiro.au/research/ecosystemservices.htm).\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide context and rationale for enhancing the quality and extent of native vegetation in a region where only 5% of it remains. We describe how native vegetation is an important natural asset (or natural capital) that provides a wide range of services, good and benefits widely value by people in the region.\n\nThe inventoried ecosystem services are those that are highly valued, particularly within the study area defined by the Wimmera-Mallee Ecosystem Function Project which has the approximate boundaries shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe billions of species on this planet, including humans and native vegetation, interact with one another in many ways. These interactions among and between species are what define ecosystems. These in turn, provide many \"services\" from which humans benefit.\n\nEcosystem services flow from natural capital or assets (vegetation, soil, water systems, plants, animals, other living organisms and the atmosphere) to provide financial, ecological and cultural benefits (Figure 2).\n\nThe physical mechanisms by which services are provided are represented in the biophysical and ecological processes that are continually occurring in any landscape or region.\n\nTypical examples of ecosystem services include: provision of clean water, maintenance of liveable climates and fertile soil, pollination, and fulfilment of cultural and intellectual needs. They in turn have several component physical processes such as sediment filtration, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration or uptake.\n\nIf natural assets are not maintained the benefits from ecosystem services decline.\n\nConversely, if natural assets are maintained and used more effectively, we will benefit from greater returns. Focus on ecosystem services encourages us to look at landscapes and ecosystems, and the processes going on in them, in a different way. This can reveal new problems and new opportunities. The ecosystem service concept broadens the set of benefits and values from nature beyond the relatively narrow set currently considered in decision making.\n\nBecause ecosystem services flow from interactions among the whole set of processes occurring in ecosystems, an ecosystem services approach forces us to view our regions holistically rather than looking at individual components in isolation from one another. An ecosystem services approach focuses on the values that people, rather than scientific theories, discern from nature, and this allows us to document scientific knowledge in ways that have immediate relevance to land managers in this and other regions.\n\nFigure 2 describes three types of ecosystem services and highlights their role in linking the environment (natural assets) with the things that people value (goods and benefits). In order to understand this, it is important to define natural assets and goods carefully.\n\nNatural Assets are the stock of natural resources from which many goods are produced. At the highest level these assets can be described as: soil, biota (vegetation, fauna and other living organisms), water systems (streams, lakes and wetlands) and atmosphere.\n\nNatural assets must be kept in good condition for at least two reasons. First, their health directly impacts on their capacity to continue to provide inputs to production; and second, natural assets have value in their own right to the extent that people derive value directly from their existence.\n\nIf natural assets are well managed they have the capacity to provide for human needs forever. This stands in contrast to human made assets that have a limited life, for example a car or a factory. Natural assets are continuously depleted and regenerated by ecosystem services, and the challenge is to ensure these assets are not depleted faster than they regenerate.\n\nGoods are all things produced in the landscape that are of value to humans. Goods are generally produced using a range of natural and human-made inputs, so it is important to also recognise the role of manufactured capital, technology, labour and social institutions in the production of goods.\n\nThe most obvious goods that are dependent on ecosystem services are agricultural products such as wool, wheat and meat, but the scope is much broader. Recreational opportunities, for example, can be viewed as goods or products coming from natural and human-made assets. There are also less tangible products such as the value provided by a beautiful view, or the well-being derived by a weekend's retreat to the countryside, or the peace of mind from knowing that other species are being maintained in viable populations.\n\nA whole range of ecosystem services can be seen in this Wimmera-Mallee (Wycheproof) landscape including: inputs into agricultural production, wildlife habitat provision, a great view and a sense of place. These services are dependent on maintaining natural assets of soil, vegetation and water systems.\n\n-Photo credit: G. Park\n\nEcosystem services, therefore, contribute to the economic and social well-being of people in and beyond the region in three ways.\n\n1. Inputs to production: Through the use of natural resources (derived from natural assets) to provide an input to production of a good. For example, fruit production is dependent on the service of pollination, which in turn is dependent on the natural asset of biota to provide insect pollinators. Similarly, crops are dependent on the service of nutrient cycling, which needs the natural asset of soil.\n\nThe self repair and regeneration of natural assets. Examples include maintaining soil health through breakdown and nutrient recycling of wheat stubbles or regeneration of native habitat through reproduction of plants and animals.\n\nThe assimilation of by-products arising from production processes or from consumption of goods. Examples include the assimilation of carbon dioxide from industry by vegetation or the detoxification of potentially toxic animal manure by dung beetles and micro-organisms.\n\nEcosystem services operate in almost every aspect of our lives and they are found just about everywhere; in forests, farm paddocks, city parks and house gardens. Individuals, farms, towns, cities and industries rely on the services that ecosystems provide.\n\nFor example, cities around the world, including Australian ones, spend billions of dollars on technology to produce drinkable water. In New York City, it was found that repairing ecosystems in the water supply catchment to produce cleaner water cost less than a fifth of the price of building a new water filtration facility.\n\nIn Australia, orchards with a high diversity of organisms in the soil cope better with pests and need much lower inputs of water and fertiliser than orchards with low soil biodiversity. This means lower costs for farmers and better water for downstream users.\n\nSocial, cultural and lifestyle benefits also come from natural assets. Recreation, tourism, a sense of collective identity and personal satisfaction are associated with Australian landscapes. If rivers and lakes are filled with algal blooms and the plains left with just a scatter of dead and dying trees, our sense of place and identity changes.\n\nEcosystem Services of the Wimmera-Mallee 9\n\nThe loss of a natural asset like a paddock tree reduces a wide range of ecosystem services including shade and shelter, wildlife habitat, control of shallow water tables and the pleasure of seeing majestic gum trees scattered across rich farming country. -Photo credit: D. Freudenberger\n\nIt is useful to think about how we would replace these services with technological solutions if nature were no longer able to provide them. How, for instance, would we replicate the way birds and insects transfer pollen between plants? Many farming and horticultural industries rely on this service, yet it is declining because of a lack of appropriate habitat for insects and birds. Technological substitutions for these and other ecosystem services, in many instances, are difficult if not impossible to recreate.\n\nThrough a workshop process, the following 13 prioritised ecosystem services were identified that are highly valued by a wide range of stakeholders in the Wimmera-Mallee (see Freudenberger and Langston 2006 for how these services were identified and ranked).\n\n1. Biodiversity conservation through habitat provision and maintenance 2. Conservation of soil health 3. Control of in-stream water quality 4. Moderation of paddock climate 5. Moderation of regional climate 6. Reduction of soil salinity and water tables 7. Mitigation of pollution 8. Pollination 9. Pest control 10. Provision of recreational, spiritual and aesthetic opportunities 11. Enhancement of land value 12. Maintenance of ecosystem resilience 13. Production of minerals, crops, pastures and firewood\n\nThese ecosystem services can be grouped into three broad types (Figure 3):\n\n1. Services that are inputs into production of goods including food and fibre 2. Regenerative services that maintain natural assets 3. Assimilations of by-products from production of goods What we attempt to do in the following sections is to describe how a diverse group of Wimmera-Mallee stakeholders value their natural assets and the ecosystem services derived from these assets.\n\nIn the text below, we summarise our understanding of the linkages between ecosystems services and the contribution native vegetation (a natural asset) makes to these services. We focus on native vegetation because the overall aim of the Ecosystem Function Project (Duncan et al 2006) is to understand the services derived from native vegetation in this region, the threats to this asset and ways to improve the services and function derived from this important natural asset.\n\nPrimary production in the Wimmera-Mallee is dependent on ecosystem services that are derived from natural assets of soil, vegetation, water, and atmosphere. This next section describes the priority services that are inputs into production systems that dominate the region.\n\nAgricultural production dominates the landscapes of the Wimmera-Mallee. For example, the region within a 100 km radius of Birchip produces over 5 million tonnes of grains, pulses and oilseeds worth over $500 million/year (Table 1). This region also produces over $100 million in sheep meat and wool.\n\nNative vegetation itself is a primary product. Firewood is an important good derived from native trees. About 2.5 million tonnes of firewood are consumed or exported from the Murray Darling Basin and some of this firewood comes from northern Victoria.\n\nMineral production is dependent on the natural assets locked-up in rock and is now of less importance to the region. However extracting gold from the region in the late 1800s helped establish the current infrastructure of towns, roads and railways. The substantial production of these commodities is underpinned by a wide range of ecosystem services including conservation of soil health, moderation of climate, pollination, pest control, enhancement of land values and life fulfilment opportunities described below.\n\nThere are a diversity of ecosystem processes and services that protect and maintain soil function we have combined under the general term 'conservation of soil health'. This broad category of services includes protection of soils from erosion, water infiltration, water storage, soil-carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and cycling, litter and stubble breakdown, and nitrogen fixation.\n\nSoil is arguably the single most valuable natural asset of the Wimmera-Mallee. Without a conserved, fertile and fully functional soil the many people, communities and businesses dependent on agriculture would be lost.\n\nLong term agricultural sustainability is dependent on the provision of soil cover, a service provided by native and exotic vegetation including crop stubbles -a form of 'green insurance'.\n\n-Photo credit: A. Gartmann\n\nWater and particularly wind erosion is an ever present risk in many parts of the Wimmera-Mallee. At the paddock and landscape scale, protection of soil from erosion is a critical ecosystem service provided by native and exotic trees, shrubs, pastures and crops. When these vegetative assets are well managed, the risk of soil erosion is minimal.\n\nLayers of cover -from trees to pasture and stubble -are 'green-insurance' against the risk of unpredictable wind and water erosion. Vegetation cover is a natural risk minimisation service of which native vegetation is an important component. It has a long history of being able to cope with just about anything the environment throws at it, including droughts, floods, fires and insect pests. When native vegetation wears out from old age and accumulated stress, it can replace itself through natural regeneration, as will be discussed later in this report.\n\nResources need to be invested to maintain vegetation cover, just like an annual premium is paid to maintain insurance cover for life and property. Maintaining soil cover comes at a cost, be it controlled grazing in a bush block, or construction and maintenance of shelter belts, or establishment of perennial pastures.\n\nEven stubble retention comes at a cost -less can be consumed by sheep, herbicides are needed to control weeds and machinery must be modified to cope with sowing into stubbles.\n\nBurning stubble is a lot cheaper than retention in the short term, but the resulting loss of soil can cost a fortune in the long term. Vegetation cover is a critical farm, landscape and community asset that provides an essential service -soil protection.\n\nThe living component of healthy soils, the myriad of bacteria, fungi, insects, worms, and roots provide a huge and generally unseen service -water infiltration. Rainfall does not flow freely into soils without assistance from soil life. Without it, rainfall tends to sit on crusted and sealed soil surfaces. Ponded surface water is critical in the right places like ephemeral wetlands, but ponded water doesn't grow crops and pastures. Ponded water on sick soils tends to rapidly evaporate or run-off into the nearest drainage line carrying precious soil with it.\n\nThese columns of water are measuring the rate at which water infiltrates into the soil. Larges pores formed by soil life play a major role in increasing water infiltration.\n\n-Photo credit: D. Eldridge\n\nAs an example, a recent study in the NSW Riverina showed how important soil life is to the water infiltration service. Freudenberger and Eldridge measured water infiltration rates of over 150 mm/hr under mature yellow box trees in a loamy duplex soil. When large soil pores greater than about 75 microns were blocked, water infiltration fell to less than 50 mm/hr.\n\nEcosystem Services of the Wimmera-Mallee\n\nThese large pores are formed by soil life: plant roots, worms, ants, termites, springtails, fungi, and other soil life.\n\nJust a few hundred metres away in a previously cropped paddock infiltration rates were as low a 10 mm/hr. A one metre column of water sat for hours on the soil surface in the cropped paddock, whereas this column of water flowed into the soil beneath the box trees within minutes.\n\nWithout the 'free' biological activity provided by a healthy soil, farmers have to spend millions on diesel fuel and tractors to cultivate the soil and re-open it to rainfall. Alternatively, water infiltration services can come free of charge from healthy soils. Growing a crop without cultivation is possible, but it can take years to rebuild soil health to allow soil biology to do the tilling rather than tractors.\n\nThere are many other soil processes that provide important ecosystem services. Soil bacteria fix tonnes of atmospheric nitrogen every year in every well managed paddock, again, free of charge. There is a huge diversity of fungi associated with plant roots (ectomyccorrhizae) that harvest scarce soil minerals needed for plant growth in exchange of carbohydrates from the host plant.\n\nHealthy soil contains a diverse group of fungi and insects that breakdown dung, leaf litter and stubbles. Without them there would be even more bush flies and soil diseases. Conservation of soil health is a fundamental ecosystem service that we've taken for granted until problems arise like acidity, salinity, soil diseases, water logging, and erosion.\n\nThere are many lessons we need to learn from soils under native vegetation. We need to know how to mimic natural systems in order to maintain soil health in our constructed systems called farming paddocks.\n\nAnother 'insurance' service provided by native and exotic trees and shrubs is shade and shelter. Livestock can usually cope well enough without shelter. But unpredictable cold and wet southerlies can howl across a barren paddock chilling to death newly born lambs, calves and sheep off-shears. Growth rates suffer when livestock can't access shade during 40 0 days and weeks. Even shade over a water trough can improve livestock production. A shed can be built over a water trough, but it far cheaper to grow a few trees. A gum tree or buloke can last for over 200 years and then replace itself -a steel shed can't. Like a shed or tractor, natural assets depreciate and have to be replaced, but replacement of natural assets can be inexpensive through natural regeneration.\n\nPlanted native vegetation on this Wimmera farm provides protection from severe winds that damage crops and stress livestock. This service is selfsustaining if native vegetation is managed to encourage tree regeneration.\n\n-Photo credit: D. Freudenberger\n\nPollination services are an input to agriculture and also an important input into regenerative services that maintain natural assets like native vegetation.\n\nHorticulturalists know that pollination services are so important that they book them through an apiarist months in advance to pollinate their fruit trees. They would have little or no crop if bees weren't there. Some crops and pastures get benefits from pollination services provided by exotic and native insects, particularly bees. Seed set in lucerne and many clovers is 100% reliant on insect pollinators. Crop yields in canola, faba beans, field peas and lupins can be substantially raised when an abundance of pollinators are present. For example, canola yields can be 25% greater in crops near bee hives. Worldwide, pollination services provided by bees have been valued at over $100 billion per year. In contrast, grain crops are wind pollinated and don't need insect pollinator services.\n\nNative vegetation is an important asset that supports healthy and continuous pollination services. Woodlands and forests of the Wimmera-Mallee provide supplementary pollen and nectar sources for native bees and managed bee colonies that otherwise struggle to find a balanced diet from a monoculture of field crops.\n\nNative vegetation also provides nesting and feeding habitat for a wide range of native pollinators including native bees, birds and bats. These species are an integral component of healthy and self-regenerative plant communities.\n\nEuropean honeybees have become feral and use tree hollows as the dominant location for hives. Although these wild bees compete with native animals using tree hollows, they are providing free pollination services to fruit trees and field crops and may also contribute to the pollination of native plant species.\n\nYields in some crops like canola can benefit from pollination services provided by honey bees and perhaps native pollinators that are found in remnant vegetation -Photo credit: Birchip Cropping Group\n\nEcosystem Services of the Wimmera-Mallee\n\nEvery organism is food for someone else. Every piece of native vegetation, crop, pasture and livestock has pests that compete with them, make them sick or try to eat them. Natural assets like native vegetation have a diversity of mechanisms to ward off invasive pest species.\n\nIntact blocks of native vegetation have a diversity of insectivorous birds, bats, spiders, reptiles and native mammals that consume millions of insects that feed on native trees. If these insect controllers are lost, tree health rapidly declines.\n\nHowever, keeping birds and bats in the landscape needs management assistance. Small woodland birds feeding on the numerous small sap-sucking insects need patches of shrubs for nesting and protection from their own predators (e.g. Magpies, Currawongs and cats). Continuous grazing by livestock eventually removes shrubs and understorey tussock grasses causing many birds to disappear leaving just a few large and aggressive birds like Noisy Miners.\n\nWell managed native vegetation can also be resistant to weed invasion. An intact understorey of perennial grasses can be remarkably weed free as long as soil disturbance is kept to a minimum. In contrast a recently cultivated paddock or roadside firebreak is ideal weed habitat.\n\nWe know less about how native vegetation assets can provide pest control services to crops and pastures. Are numbers of red-legged earth mites less downwind of a block or strip of vegetation? Does a wide and intact strip of native bush reduce weed seeds being blown in from the neighbouring paddocks? Does a well fenced shelter-belt reduce the risk of foot-rot spreading from one flock of sheep to the next? These are the kinds of questions that get raised once we start to think about native vegetation from the service delivery point of view.\n\nA patch of bush can provide tangible and practical services to the 'front-paddock' used to produce food and fibre.\n\nA 'messy' understorey of shrubs, tussock grasses and fallen timber provide habitat for reptiles, birds and bats that feed on tree insect pests that can contribute to dieback. A native understorey is also resistant to weed invasion and promotes the success of natural regeneration.\n\n-Photo credit: C. Moxham\n\nThe Wimmera-Mallee produces more than crops and livestock. It's a placed called home for thousands of generations of Aboriginal first settlers and a new home for up to five generation of new settlers.\n\nThe Wimmera-Mallee is a distinctive place to live or visit, not just because it grows wheat and fat lambs. The Wimmera-Mallee is a distinctive place because of its landscapes of towns, hills, ephemeral wetlands and diversity of bushland. Native vegetation provides the iconic look, feel and smell of the region -Mallee doesn't look, smell nor feel the same as a plantation of exotic pine trees.\n\nWho isn't moved by the sight of verdant green fields in spring or the golden hues of harvest, the symphony of the dawn chorus, or the rich colours of a Mallee sunset?\n\nThese 'life-fulfilment' services are often taken for granted, and they don't come free of obligation and responsibility. The golden fields of ripening wheat can be eliminated by drifting sands. A 'silent spring' can be created by the impact of pesticide residues. 'Woolly herbicides' (sheep) can graze out understorey habitat needed by our unique and diverse song-birds. Hollow-loving birds are in danger if tree seedlings don't establish and create the next generation of tree hollows once old paddock trees die and fall over.\n\nTowns and villages like Wycheproof in the background of this photo would struggle or disappear if the region wasn't a pleasant place to live and work. Native vegetation is an important asset that contributes to life-fulfilment services.\n\n-Photo Credit: C. Moxham\n\nLocal tourism is important for many businesses in the Wimmera-Mallee. Some visitors may be coming to see an oversized Mallee bull in the centre of Birchip, but they won't stay long without the network of friendly and well-kept towns in the region that depend on the health of the soil and the health of the farmers who coax crops and pastures from this landscape. If life in the Wimmera-Mallee isn't fulfilling, particularly for the next generation of farmers and business people, then the region will surely suffer.\n\nLife-fulfilment services can also generate 'hard' cash. Native bushland and wetlands contribute to a varied landscape that can be financially worth more than a monotonous and tree-less vista. There isn't much hard data on how patches of native vegetation add to the re-sale value of rural properties, but there is no doubt that \"creek-frontage\" is a selling point in many real estate advertisements. The rewards of investing in the region are more than just tonnes of wheat and thousands of prime lambs. Well managed native vegetation on roadsides, in natures reserves and on-farm is an important part of the value of an acre of land.\n\nThis well treed creek frontage on the Avon River near Banyena provides a wide range of ecosystem services including enhancement of land values .\n\nPhoto credit: G. Park\n\nAny agricultural, manufacturing or natural process creates 'wastes' which we prefer to call 'by-products'. Dung and urine are a by-product of livestock, but a source of food for dung beetles and a nutrient source for plants. Pesticides and herbicides are useful if they only do their killing for a short period of time. In contrast long-term toxins like DDT and other organophosphates have been banned because they are not rapidly broken down by microbes or by other natural bio-chemical pathways.\n\nHigh value assimilation services identified in the Wimmera-Mallee include control of water quality, moderation of regional climates, mitigation of pollution, and reduction of shallow and saline water tables which are described below.\n\nNative vegetation is an important asset for ensuring water quality. As rainfall hits and moves across landscapes, both through the soil and on the soil surface, it often picks up sediments that can greatly impair water quality.\n\nNative vegetation cover reduces rainfall impact, and can capture sediments in grassed paddocks, riparian buffer strips and through well vegetated wetlands. Sediment filtration occurs by three processes: sediment particles can 'stick' to the surfaces of vegetation; sediments can settle when water flow is reduced by a dense cover of vegetation; and sediments can settle when water infiltrates into an open soil structure.\n\nNative vegetation has a great influence on water infiltration. In the absence of tree cover infiltration can be as low as 10 mm/hr, whereas beneath a yellow box canopy, infiltration rates were up to 200 mm/hr. Rainfall events greater than 10 mm/hr are common, hence sediment laden run-off from treeless paddocks are common. Rainfall events greater than 200 mm/hr are very rare, so seldom exceed the capacity of woodland soils to absorb rainfall. The run-off of water from a well-treed woodland is usually clear as the water is moving through the soil rather than over the soil because of the very high soil infiltration rates found under trees.\n\nThe quality of water in channels, farm dams and creeks is a direct consequence of vegetation management. Poor management leaves soils exposed to erosion, sediment mobilisation and entrainment of excess nutrients leading to water turbidity and potentially toxic blue-green algal blooms.\n\nNative vegetation, including fallen timber, plays an important role in stabilising waterways and reducing bank erosion, the major source of sediments in creeks and rivers. -Photo credit: G. Park Woodlands, grasslands, riparian zones, wetlands and ephemeral lakes are all important natural assets that contribute to provision of quality water. These assets support many other ecosystem services including terrestrial and aquatic habitat, recreational opportunities and a sense of place. Quality water is a reflection of quality land management.\n\nVegetation cover moderates local, regional and global climate variability and change. As discussed previously, shelter belts and paddock trees provide warmer micro-climates in winter through the provision of wind protection services. In summer this same vegetation cools the air in the form of shade and protection from hot winds. At a regional scale prior to the introduction of agriculture, woodland cover is likely to have provided warmer nights and cooler days through the giga-litres of water an extensive woodland evaporates through leaves of trees, shrubs and grasses. This cover has largely been cleared to make way for annual crops and pastures, and hence the temperature, humidity and wind run of the Wimmera-Mallee is likely to be more variable and extreme than it was prior to clearing.\n\nThe Wimmera-Mallee climate has likely become more variable and extreme due to extensive conversion of woodlands to crops and pastures.\n\n-Photo credit: D. Freudenberger\n\nAt a global scale, vegetation buffers climate variability and may reduce the speed of climate change through fixing carbon via photosynthesis. Even prior to the industrial revolution, many tonnes of carbon and other greenhouse gases were released into the atmosphere through wildfires, animal digestion and natural decomposition, particularly in wetlands.\n\nVegetation played an important role as a 'sink' or store for the vast flux of gases that make up our atmosphere and its climate. This vegetative store is more important now that many tonnes of fossil carbon and other gases are being released on a daily basis from modern industrial processes, including agriculture. Just when we need more vegetation to buffer the world's atmosphere and climate, we have less of it due to clearing for agriculture. Markets are slowly developing where power companies are paying over $100/tonne/ha/yr for carbon fixation and sequestration services in NSW. At this price, it may become more profitable for farmers to provide carbon services rather than production of annual cereal crops.\n\nAs described earlier, native and exotic vegetation cover can reduce the risk of wind erosion. Without this service, air pollution from wind borne dust is unsightly, a loss of valuable resource and also unhealthy.\n\nHealthy soil assets support complex groups of micro-organisms that have sophisticated chemical 'micro-factories' that rapidly breakdown agri-chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides. Without healthy soil assets, animal dung and urine would rapidly accumulate to toxic levels. Dozens of species of dung beetle were imported into Australia to handle sheep and cattle dung as native dung beetles weren't able to adapt fast enough to this new source of food. Without these imported dung beetles, pasture production was impaired by being smothered in long-lasting cow pats, and black bush flies were far worse than they are now.\n\nWithout pollutant assimilation services, piggery and chicken shed wastes could not be recycled back into soils. Towns and cities harness the ecosystem services provided by microbes in their sewage treatment plants. Our health is utterly dependent on clean water and air which is turn dependent on billions of humble bacteria, fungi and plants.\n\nThis service can be viewed as an assimilation of by-products of agricultural production in the sense that current dryland farming systems at times do not use all available soil moisture. This surplus moisture can drain deeper into soil profiles well below the root zone of crops and eventually contribute to rising water tables that are often saline. Perennial and deep rooted native vegetation can intercept and use soil moisture that drains beyond the rooting zone of crops and annual pastures.\n\nAn example of this service is action has been carefully quantified by John Ive, a farmer in the Southern Tablelands of NSW. He and his family planted a block of native agroforestry that has substantially reduced a saline water table below a highly productive phalaris pasture, down-slope of his tree block.\n\nA diverse planting of native vegetation on this Wimmera-Mallee farm provides a wide range of ecosystem services including shade, shelter, wildlife habitat and reduction in deep drainage into potentially shallow and saline water tables.\n\n-Photo credit: A. Gartmann\n\nThere can be trade-offs amongst the range of ecosystem services provided by native vegetation. Trees can reduce the risk of dryland salinity, but their roots can spread into cropped paddocks and compete with crops for soil moisture during a dry season. These same trees can reduce the risk of water logging during a wet growing season. The competitive effect of trees depends on the species, the height/age of the trees, crop type and soil type. The competitive effect needs to weighed against the risk of salinity, erosion or livestock losses from lack of shelter. Native vegetation is an important component of managing environmental risks in the inherently variable climate of the Wimmera-Mallee.\n\nFarm assets like buildings and machinery wear out. This depreciation is recognised as a cost of production and is calculated annually by every farm accountant. But when was the last time we calculated the annual depreciation of our natural assets like soil and vegetation?\n\nWe tend to ignore depreciation of natural assets because they usually have self-repair processes that provide free maintenance services called growth and regeneration. Below, we briefly describe some of the key regenerative services contributed by native vegetation in the Wimmera-Mallee.\n\nThere are few substitutes for native vegetation providing habitat to the remarkable diversity of native organisms still surviving in the Wimmera-Mallee.\n\nA small number of native birds like galahs and cockatoos can feed solely in crops and pastures, but even these birds need native trees with hollows for nesting. A myriad of reptiles can be found in mallee remnants, but not in adjacent cropped paddocks. The diversity of native insects found in native vegetation is astounding. In a recent study in Western Australia, over 1600 different species of insect were found in just 40 trees from four species of gum trees. Insect surveys in just 35 patches of woodland remnants in the Riverina Bioregion near Berrigan, NSW found over 145 species of ants, many of them not previously known to science. Up to a dozen species of bats can feed in the agricultural matrix of crops, pastures and scattered trees, but require sizeable patches of remnant vegetation for roosting and breeding.\n\nThe survival of most of this remarkable diversity is dependent on the maintenance and regeneration of native vegetation. Maintenance of habitat remains a significant challenge.\n\nClearing regulations have halted broad scale loss of habitats found in native vegetation, but habitats continue to degrade through invasion of weeds and animal pests like rabbits, hares and foxes.\n\nGrazing and camping by livestock in remnant vegetation accelerates weed invasion through nutrient enrichment from excrement and weed seeds brought in via dung and wool. Total grazing pressure is often unsustainable in unfenced remnants leading to the loss of understorey grasses, forbs and shrubs -vital habitat for birds, lizards and insects. Even fenced remnants can be overgrazed by kangaroos no longer controlled by dingoes or reduced by the lack of drinking water in summer. Total native vegetation cover may now be reasonably stable as limited clearing is balanced by replanting efforts, but habitat is still being lost and species are still declining.\n\nThe diversity of species in a Wimmera woodland patch like this is staggering. There could be over 1000 species of insects in this patch providing food for a wide range of reptiles, birds and bats. Native vegetation is the keystone to this service of habitat provision.\n\n-Photo credit: G. Park\n\nNatural regeneration of habitat appears to be an even greater challenge than simply maintaining habitat. Across a vast proportion of the Wimmera-Mallee, natural regeneration has been lost. Native trees, shrubs and even grasses no longer spontaneously regenerate during a fallow period between crops. Even in well fenced remnants, regeneration services appear to have been impaired. Some remnants appear to be stuck in a degraded state dominated by an understorey of weeds which appear to suppress regeneration of native species.\n\nWhere is the next generation of trees? Even along Wimmera-Mallee roadsides, natural regeneration is rare for a number of reasons, including competition from weeds supported by soil nutrients blowing in from the adjoining cropped paddock.\n\n-Photo credit: G. Park\n\nWhere natural regenerative services have been lost, we need to provide the services through seed collection, propagation, and establishment. Everyone who has been involved in this 'synthetic' regenerative service knows how hard and expensive it is. Collecting seed is hard -you have to be at the right place, at the right time, just before native trees and shrubs shed their seed. Fluffy grass seeds are hard to collect and sow. Native trees and shrubs can be hard to germinate. Different species need different pre-planting treatments like scarification, hot water or smoke water. Once germinated, droughts, floods, rabbits, hares, cockatoos, insects and other pests can kill newly planted species. Direct seeding can take some of this risk out of replanting, but success is often patchy, and like any sowing practice it takes much preparation (e.g. fencing, cultivation and multiple herbicide treatments).\n\nScientists and tree planters are starting to understand the ecosystem services provided by soil microbes needed to aid in tree establishment. CSIRO's Peter Thrall has developed a mix of rhizobial bacteria needed to inoculate Acacia species when planting into long cultivated paddocks. Peter and the farmers he's working with have found that these bacteria reduce seedling mortality and improve growth rates. These inoculants are now available commercially. The services from these nitrogen fixing microbes have been lost from many cropping landscapes and we now have to pay cash to get them back. Soil fungi (ectomyccorrhizae) needed to scavenge nutrients for eucalypt trees may also be missing, which impairs eucalypt establishment and growth. We often take ecosystem services for granted, but rue their loss when they are gone.\n\nSuccessful direct seeding like this is still far more expensive than natural regeneration, but may be the most cost effective means of tree establishment where spontaneous regeneration services no longer exist.\n\n-Photo credit: D. Freudenberger\n\nResilience is the ability of natural assets to recover from disturbances. Australia's natural assets, be they soil, woodlands, grasslands and rivers are amazingly tough. They have needed to be to cope with millions of years of climate changes, and decadal swings from droughts and fires to floods.\n\nThis toughness, this resilience, can be lost. Nature can only handle so much stress until suddenly the system collapses.\n\nIf disturbances are too severe, resilience can be lost. It's been decades since football was last played on this Dingo Dam pitch north of Ouyen (note the Callitris pine goalposts), but no tree regeneration has occurred, even though a seed source is only meters away in the bush reserve.\n\n-Photo credit: D.Duncan\n\nThe red gums and black box of the Wimmera-Mallee can survive for decades without a good flood to recharge shallow water tables and provide a muddy seed bed for regeneration. But long-term survival without flood is not possible. Red gums and box trees are dying now -it's been too long between deep drinks. Once a big stretch of trees are lost, they are unlikely to return as sick and dead trees don't produce seed. Resilience to long periods of drought is lost when these long-lived giants perish.\n\nRising and falling shallow water tables have probably been a feature of Australian landscapes for millennia. Small salt scalds have probably been appearing and disappearing for millions of years. That's why there are so many salt tolerant native species in Australia. It is the current scale of salinisation that is the problem. Once a large area goes saline, it may be to too large to easily recover if and when the water tables drop through pumping or better management of upper catchment recharge.\n\nAustralian flora and fauna are also remarkably resilient in the face of fire. But resilience from fire requires a period of recovery between fires to replenish root stores, or time to flower and set seed which can take years in some species. Wildlife may be killed in a fire, but will rapidly recolonise a burnt area if they can find a way to return. This may not happen in a highly fragmented landscape of crops and pastures and small isolated patches of bush. An 'island' remnant may get burned out, including possums and gliders. The trees may regenerate, but a glider can't glide beyond 50-75 metres between trees, let alone kilometres between an unburnt isolated patches of bush to the regenerating burnt patch. Fragmentation has resulted in a loss of resilience -nature doesn't bounce back as well after major disturbances.\n\n03/04/1997 O4/11/03 01/12/2004\n\nThe remarkable resilience of native vegetation to disturbances like fire is clearly seen in these photos of a native forest taken 5 years before, 10 months after and nearly 2 years after a severe firestorm swept across the Brindabella Mountains, ACT -Photo credit: M. Doherty\n\nNative vegetation is an important asset that supports many services that are highly valued by many people in the Wimmera-Mallee. When this asset depreciates, that is, when vegetation condition declines, provision of ecosystem services is impaired. The 'condition' of native vegetation is an important indicator of levels of ecosystem services.\n\nDefining vegetation condition requires value judgements on what is 'good' or 'bad'; acceptable or unacceptable. We define 'good' condition as attributes or characteristics of vegetation in the Wimmera-Mallee that enhance ecosystem services that are valued in the region. We define 'poor' condition as vegetation that has been degraded and provides fewer ecosystem services.\n\nBroad attributes, or measures of vegetation condition include: extent, configuration, isolation, structure, composition and function. In the sections below, we describe how these characteristics of vegetation condition affect provision of ecosystem services.\n\nAt a landscape scale (100s of km 2 ), the overall cover (extent) of native vegetation affects provision of many ecosystem services.\n\nStudies in northern Victoria have shown that provision of adequate habitat is highly dependent on overall vegetation cover. Many wildlife species have disappeared from landscapes that have less than 10% native cover.\n\nMaintenance of soil health and fresh water tables is also dependent on regional vegetation cover. Much deep rooted native vegetation has been lost leading to rising water tables and spread of salinised soil. The extensive loss of riparian and flood plain vegetation has reduced the provision of quality water. Now that the land has been cleared, there is much more soil water available for the provision of crops, but much less water available for moderating the Wimmera-Mallee climate.\n\nLandscapes such as this produce many agricultural products but other ecosystems services have been greatly reduced since overall tree cover is less than 3%.\n\n-Photo credit: J. Stol\n\nWhat vegetation is left is often in poor condition and provides fewer ecosystem services because much has been left in narrow strips rather than wide blocks of bush. Narrow strips (<100 m wide) provide fewer weed control services. Fertiliser, soil and weed seeds get blown at least 100 m into blocks of bush. Narrow strips of native vegetation also provides fewer protective services in the form of shelter from wind and prevention of erosion. Shelter belts need to be at least three tree or shrub rows wide and no more than about 500 metres a part to provide effective wind protection.\n\nSmall patches of bush provide fewer habitats than large patches. Fewer species of wildlife can find a home in a one hectare patch compared to a 10, 50, or 500 ha patch. Large patches provide more habitat services because they have more resources and are often across a greater variety of soil types (e.g. dunes and swales) rather than a single soil type (e.g. dune). A diversity of soil types usually supports a much greater diversity of plants specialised to grow on different soils. A greater diversity of plants supports a greater diversity of insects, flowering times and nesting habitats for a greater diversity of wildlife.\n\nThe provision of ecosystems services provided by native vegetation is also affected by how near or far a patch of native bush is to other patches and strips. It is difficult to maintain provision of habitat services, particularly regeneration services, when a patch of bush becomes so isolated that bird, bat and insect pollinators can not make the journey to pollinate native plants. Eucalypt trees can become so isolated from their own species that they can get swamped by pollen from related species and produce mostly hybrid seed. The viability and suitability of hybrid seed is not known.\n\nFire is a natural force across the Wimmera-Mallee. Wildfires have been sweeping across the region for millions of years. At a large scale, fires are always patchy. Some areas only get a cool burn during the night, other areas get scorched during the heat of the day, other areas escape entirely. In an intact landscape with vast swathes of woodlands, wildlife is free to move from unburnt areas to recolonise regenerating burnt habitat. In a fragmented landscape, a patch of bush can burn fiercely and much habitat can be temporarily lost.\n\nHowever as native plants invariably grow back after fire, return of wildlife may no longer be possible. Many species cannot move through a matrix of cultivated soil and treeless pastures to recolonise a burnt out patch of bush. Habitat regeneration and recolonisation, a high value ecosystem service, can be greatly impaired by isolation of native vegetation -a landscape scale measure of vegetation condition.\n\nA small and isolated patch of mallee such as this is providing far fewer ecosystem services than if it was a part of a larger and well connected patch. These trees in this configuration provide little wind protection and very few species of wildlife can find enough feeding and nesting habitat in such a small and isolated patch.\n\n-Photo credit: J. Stol\n\nEcosystem Services of the Wimmera-Mallee\n\nInternal structure (layers) Within a patch of bush, many ecosystem services can be impaired by poor vegetation condition. Loss of condition can be recognised through the loss of vegetation layers.\n\nPoor condition remnants have generally lost their mid-storey of shrubs and regenerating trees. Mid-storey is an important habitat for many groups of wildlife, particularly birds. A 'messy' or chaotic understorey of fallen timber and grass tussocks provides habitat for millions of insects from hundreds of species which in turn provide food for ground dwelling reptiles, frogs, birds and small mammals.\n\nPoor condition vegetation is often characterised by just a single age group of trees, either very old trees and no young trees, or just young trees that regenerated from timber harvesting or incomplete clearing operations. Old trees provide hollows for the many wildlife species that nest in them. Young trees are required for the next generation of hollow baring trees.\n\nA heavily grazed patch of mallee showing the loss of understorey shrubs and native grass tussocks. Note also the lack of any young regenerating trees. Livestock find valuable shelter in this kind of bush, but their dung and urine accumulate adding soil nutrients to support highly competitive weeds -Photo credit: C. Moxham\n\nLivestock are provided shade and shelter when they are allowed into a patch of bush, but in the long-term, continuous access destroys the very shelter they depend upon. Regenerative services are greatly impaired by continuous livestock grazing or trampling of seedlings. Soil health can also be impaired. Long-term hoof action can break up biological soil crusts of lichens and mosses which provide safe micro-sites for seed germination and protect the soil surface from rain drop splash and accelerated erosion. Habitat and regenerative services can be greatly impaired by the accumulation of dung and urine brought in by livestock. This importation of nutrients can support nitrogen-and phosphorous-loving weeds that normally can't grow in large numbers in naturally nutrient poor Mallee soils. Weeds can out compete native seedlings essential for natural regeneration.\n\nWeeds change the composition of remnants which in turn impairs provision of habitat services. Some native wildlife and insect species can use weeds as feeding or nesting habitats, but others can't. Many native insects feed only on native plants, and these insects then provide food for spiders, reptiles, birds and bats. Weeds compete with native plant seedlings and reduce the changes of natural regeneration.\n\nLoss of plants and animals also impairs life fulfilment services. To naïve eyes, an understorey of purple Paterson's curse or yellow cape weed may look attractive in spring, but to locals, such weeds are eye-sores and take away our enjoyment of the bush. The loss of the subtle colours of native flora, and the patina of lichens and mosses on the soil surface reduces the joy of walking through a patch of mallee or buloke. A shelter belt of exotic pines may do an excellent job providing soil protection and shelter services, but it doesn't have that wonderful smell of mallee after a shower of rain. Native vegetation in good condition contributes to our sense of place in the Wimmera-Mallee.\n\nThe extent, shape, connectivity, structure and composition of native vegetation all contribute to how well it works -how it functions to provide us with a diversity of ecosystem services at very low cost.\n\nWhen the condition of vegetation is impaired, so too are the ecosystem services derived from our vegetation assets. Water quality, climatic extremes, and the health of crops, pastures, livestock and people are all dependent on vegetation in good condition. For example, vegetation is needed that is wide enough, big enough and thick enough to prevent water tables rising, provide shade and shelter, and be a home to the diversity of plants and animals.\n\nJust as importantly, well functioning native vegetation replaces itself. It doesn't have to be replanted or fertilised or sprayed against pest insect pest, even after a fire sweeps though and reduces so much to ash. Native vegetation is a unique asset providing some amazing services.\n\nThe ecosystem services concept and framework (Figs. 2 & 3) provides a useful and inclusive way of developing restoration strategies. This framework recognises that natural assets are more than 'pristine' expanses of native vegetation unsoiled by human technologies. This human-centric framework suggests that restoration is more than revegetating the landscape with local native species. It suggests that landscape restoration is based on maintaining and improving a wide range of services people value.\n\nRestoration includes agricultural services provided by well managed crops that conserve soil and maximise water use. Restoration includes rotations of deep rooted pastures grazed by quality livestock protected by networks of native and exotic shelter belts. Restoration includes establishment of grassy buffers along paddock drainage lines. It includes revegetation strategies to widen narrow remnants and reduce their isolation.\n\nRestoration of ecosystem services requires a whole of landscape approach that includes cropping systems, grazing management strategies, construction of riparian buffers and inclusion of isolated paddock trees into wood-lots and shelter belts. -Photo credit: J. Stol\n\nRestoration includes conserving and enhancing the ability of native vegetation to regenerate itself. The focus of the Wimmera-Mallee Ecosystem Services Project is on restoration of regenerative processes in order to maintain habitats and landscape health -the overwhelming priority service identified by the Inventory Workshop (Freudenberger and Langston 2006).\n\nNatural regeneration is a complex interaction of climate, soil conditions, the availability of propagules (fungal spores, plants seeds and suckers) and reduced levels of competitors and predators. We will never fully understand all the subtle processes that contribute to regeneration, but through research with land managers we should be able to gain a better understanding of what key conditions and management practices are needed for it to occur.\n\nBiological processes that support regenerative services include:\n\n• Seed-set which is often dependent on pollination from a myriad of organisms;\n\n• Genetically viable seed dependent on sufficient number of con-specific plants for those species dependent on out-crossing; • Seedling establishment which is dependent on provision of safe sites for germination with adequate soil moisture and shade. Seedling establishment may also require fire to stimulate germination and provide a suitable seed bed with few competing plants.\n\n• Seedling persistence is dependent on seasonal climate conditions and pest control. It may require human intervention through controlling total grazing pressure and reducing competing weeds. • Sapling survival may depend on pest control services provided by insectivorous birds, bats and parasitic wasps that control herbivorous insects that can greatly impair native vegetation health • Regeneration is also dependent on numerous soil organisms needed to breakdown plant litter, recycle nutrients and maintain large soil pores required for high water infiltration rates.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of bio-processes needed for the persistence and renewal of native vegetation.\n\nThe workshop process, and this description of ecosystem services, has shown that services derived from native vegetation, particularly habitat provision, are highly valued. If these services are to persist and grow, then particularly attention needs to be paid to the biological processes needed to maintain and regenerate native vegetation assets.\n\nThe maintenance and regeneration of natural assets like native vegetation is a critical, though often ignored class of ecosystem services. Too often, services that provide input to the provision of goods such as food and fibre are the sole focus of attention. Many regenerative services have either been lost or are greatly impaired in the Wimmera-Mallee.\n\nValuing the full complement of ecosystems services and benefits is an important means of understanding how native vegetation supports, directly and indirectly, so many valued services in the region.\n\nEcosystem Services of the Wimmera-Mallee"
