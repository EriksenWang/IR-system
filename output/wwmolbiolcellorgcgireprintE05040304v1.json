    "abstract": "Fragile X Related 1 protein (FXR1P) is a member of a small family of RNAbinding proteins that includes the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 protein (FMR1P) and the Fragile X-Related 2 protein (FXR2P). These proteins are thought to transport mRNA and to control their translation. While FMR1P is highly expressed in neurons, substantial levels of FXR1P are found in striated muscles and heart, which are devoid of FMRP and FXR2P. However, little is known about the functions of FXR1P. We have isolated cDNAs for Xenopus Fxr1 and found that two specific splice variants are conserved in evolution. Knockdown of xFxr1p in Xenopus had highly muscle specific effects, normal MyoD expression being disrupted, somitic myotomal cell rotation and segmentation being inhibited and dermatome formation being abnormal. Consistent with the absence of the long muscle specific xFxr1p isoform during early somite formation, these effects could be rescued by both the long and short mRNA variants. Microarray analyses showed that xFxr1p depletion affected the expression of 129 known genes of which 50% were implicated in muscle and nervous system formation. These studies shed significant new light on Fxr1p function(s).",
    "full_text": "Fragile X Related 1 (FXR1) belongs to a small gene family that includes Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) and Fragile X-Related 2 (FXR2) (reviewed in Khandjian, 1999;Bardoni and Mandel, 2002). Human FMR1 is located on chromosome X at q27.3 (Sutherland, 1977), while FXR1 and FXR2 are autosomal genes mapping at 3q28 and 17p13.1, respectively (Coy et al.,1995;Zhang et al. , 1995). Inactivation of FMR1 expression is the cause of the Fragile X syndrome in human (Imbert et al., 1998;O'Donnell and Warren, 2002), while FXR1 and FXR2\n\nhave not been associated so far with any known pathology or defect. The three genes code for proteins that are highly conserved in vertebrate evolution. They are structurally very similar and share high degree of sequence homologies in clustered regions. They contain two KH domains and a RGG box that are characteristic motifs in RNA-binding proteins as well as nuclear localization and export signals (NLS and NES, respectively)  (Zhang et al., 1995;Siomi et al., 1995;Eberhart et al., 1996). Similarily to its other homologs, FXR1P is predominantly associated with polyribosomal messenger ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) and is thought to play a yet unknown role in translation control (Siomi et al., 1996;Khandjian, 1999;Dubé et al., 2000).\n\nThe expression pattern of FXR1P is rather complex in mammal. Six distinct protein isoforms have been detected and their respective levels were shown to be cell type specific. Four isoforms of 70, 74, 78, and 80 kDa are widely expressed in all cell lines and mouse tissues so far tested, while these isoforms are absent in heart and skeletal muscles and are replaced by longer isoforms of 82-84 kDa (Khandjian et al., 1998;Dubé et al., 2000). The shifts in apparent molecular weights are clearly observed during in vitro differentiation of myocytes and transition of myoblasts to myotubes as the 70 to 80 kDa isoforms are progressively replaced by the 82-84 kDa species generated by the insertion of a small peptide pocket of 27 aa (Dubé et al., 2000). This short peptide stretch is coded by exon15 corresponding to the 81 bp insertion present in mRNA variants that have been detected in striated muscles and in adult testis (Khandjian et al., 1998;Kirkpatrick et al., 1999;Huot et al., 2001) and appears to be conserved in evolution having been detected in man, mouse and more recently in zebrafish (Engels et al., 2004;Tucker et al., 2004).\n\nWhile viable mouse knockout (KO) models for both Fmr1 and Fxr2 have been generated (Bakker et al., 1994;Bontekoe et al., 2002), homozygous Fxr1 -/ - neonates die shortly after birth most likely due to cardiac and/or respiratory failure (Mientjes et al., 2004) making difficult to study these phenotypes. A second mouse model that expresses reduced levels of Fxr1p has been also generated, and displays reduced limb musculature and a reduced life span of about 18 weeks. This latter animal model has suggested the implication of Fxr1p in skeletal muscle development (Mientjes et al., 2004).\n\nIn our approach to study the function of Fxr1p in vivo, we chose the Xenopus laevis model since large number of eggs are easily obtained and offer rapid embryonic development external to the mother. It is a highly flexible model since gene expression can be perturbed by microinjection of antisense Morpholino TMoligonucleotides (MO; Summerton and Weller, 1997;Heasman, 2002) in order to directly test the role and/or functions of the protein of interest. Most importantly, Xenopus offers the possibility to inject different amounts of MO in order to study the dose dependent inactivation of the target sequences, allowing a wide range of induced phenotypes to be studied. Here we show that xFxr1 plays a vital role during Xenopus embryogenesis since its complete or partial inactivation has dramatic impact on myotome formation. The inactivation of xFxr1 also has an impact on the expression of many genes implicated in embryogenesis and more particulaly in myogenesis.\n\nMorpholino™. The antisense (match) xFxr1.Morpholino™ (xFxr1.MO) (5'-GCACTTCCACCGTCATGTCCTCCAT-3') and mismatch Morpholino™ (xFxr1mm-MO) (5'-GCAgTTgCACCGTgATGTCgTCgAT-3') (Gene Tools) corresponded to nucleotides +1 to +25 of xFXR1 mRNA relative to the ATG. The Morpholino against the human globin was also used as a second negative control: hGlob.MO (5'-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3'). The Morpholino™ was diluted in water and 0.1 to 1.0 pmole was injected into one or two blastomeres of two cell stage embryos. These were allowed to develop to the appropriate stage before analyses. Rescue of the Morpholino effects was achieved by co-injecting mRNA encoding the full length HA-tagged xFxr1. The xFxr1 cDNA encoding amino acids 2 to 677 was sub-cloned into pT7TS (obtained from P. Krieg) in-frame with an N-terminal HA1-epitope as previously described (Bisson et al., 2003).\n\nCapped RNA was transcribed from linearised plasmid using T7 (sense transcripts) (mMESSAGE-mMACHINE, Ambion) and RNA disolved in water was injected into one or two blastomeres of two cell Xenopus embryos. Eggs were recovered in MMR (0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM Hepes, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8), in vitro fertilized, injected with the MO and/or mRNA in 0.2 x MMR, 5% Ficoll and then cultured in 0.1 x MMR at 18 o C. Embryo stages were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (1967).\n\nWhole mount in situ hybridization, cryosections and Hoechst staining. Wholemount in situ hybridization was carried out on pigmented X. laevis (Nasco) as described ( Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1990;Jowett and Lettice, 1994). Embryos\n\nused for whole mount in situ hybridizations were rehydrated in PBS and transferred to 1.6 M sucrose in PBS for more than 12 hrs before being placed in a drop of Tissue-Tek embedding solution (Miles) and frozen on a metal block on dry ice.\n\nSections of 16 μm were cut with a Microm HM 500 cryostat microtome and picked up on gelatin coated slides and allowed to air dry for 30-60 min. Slides were incubated in water for 2 min, transferred to a Hoechst solution (Sigma, 0.2 mM in water) for 10 min and washed 5 min in water. Sections were analyzed under fluorescence with a Leica DMIRE2 microscope and Openlab software (Improvision).\n\nNorthern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from Xenopus and mice tissues using the Trizol reagents (Gibco) and quantified by UV densitometry. Northern blot analyses were performed as described (Khandjian, 1986) with the exception that RNA was transferred to nylon membranes by vacuum blotting. 32 P-labelled probes were prepared by random-priming and used at approximately 10 6 cpm per ml of hybridization solution.\n\nMicroarrays. RNA from whole embryos was extracted using the Trizol reagents.\n\nRNA was then cleaned of any residual DNA and protein contaminants using the RNAeasy column (Qiagen\n\n). Purified RNA was quantified using a Biochrom GeneQuant spectrometre. Microarray analyses were performed using Affymetrix chips (No 900492) containing 14,400 transcripts. Analyses were done in triplicate with RNA extracted from three individual series of injections. Microarray and statistics analyses were performed at the Genome Quebec Innovation Centre/McGill University core facility.\n\nImmunoblot analyses. Organs were removed from animals, processed according to standard protocols and protein extracts prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (Khandjian et al., 1995). Immunoblot analyses were performed using mAb3FX and antisera #27-17 directed against FXR1P (dil. 1:2000 and 1:5000, respectively).\n\nOther antibodies and sera used were: anti-β-tubulin mAbE7 and anti-actin mAbJLA20 (obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank University of Iowa, USA), anti-L7 ribosomal protein (obtained from A. Ziemiecki) and anti-FMRP mAb1C3 (Devys et al. 1993). Detection of bound antibodies was performed with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies followed by ECL reaction as described (Corbin et al., 1997).\n\nImmunohistochemistry. Xenopus and mice embryos were fixed in a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 18 h at 4 o C. After dehydration in increasing ethanol series, tissues were embedded in paraffin. Five µm sections were processed for deparaffinization and for microwave oven treatments.\n\nEndogenous peroxidase was inhibited by a 15 min treatment with 0.5% H 2 O 2 solution in PBS and the sections were next incubated for 18 h at 4°C with antiserum #27-17 (dil. 1:500) or mAb3FX (dil. 1:500). Bound Ig was reacted with biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and stained with the AEC chromogen (Histomouse-SP Kit, Zymed, CA). The slides were then mounted in GVA Mount (Zymed). Light microscopy was performed using a Nikon TE300 microscope connected to a CoolSnap camera (RS Photometrics) using 10x, 40x and 60x objectives. Images were transferred to the Adobe Photoshop program.\n\nEarlier studies have shown that FXR1P 82-84 kDa isoforms are expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle in mammals while the other isoforms are absent from these tissues (Khandjian et al., 1998). These specific long-isoforms containing 27 additional a.a. accumulate during myoblastic differentiation of mammalian cultured cells (Dubé et al., 2000). Of the several available antibodies raised against different mouse and human FXR1P isoforms, two, namely mAb3FX and rabbit serum #27-17, also recognized the frog protein. While mAb3FX reacted with all Fxr1p isoforms in mouse tissues, only two species of 84 and 88 kDa were observed in\n\n. It should also be noted that this monoclonal antibody also reacts with mammalian FXR2P (Khandjian et al., 1998) but does not detect a putative frog ortholog. In contrast, #27-17 revealed the presence of both mouse 82-84 and frog 88 kDa long isoforms in heart and muscle (Fig. 1). On the other hand FMRP was predominently detected in frog brain extract, as is the case for mouse. Due to the fact that the mAb1C3 reacts slightly with mouse Fxr1p, additional faints bands were also detected in heart and muscle extracts that contain high amounts of the long Fxr1p isoforms (Fig. 1).\n\nThese results indicate that the tissue specificities of FXR1P and FMR1P are conserved from mammals to amphibians.\n\nWhile extensive alternative splicing of FXR1 primary transcript has been observed in mouse and in human (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999), only a single mRNA species has been described in Xenopus (Siomi et al., 1995). Since the FXR1 gene is highly conserved in evolution and in the mouse model Fxr1 mRNA variants are tissue specific, we hypothesized that different mRNA variants should also be present in\n\nUsing primers targeting sequences found in mouse Fxr1 exon 14 and 17, we performed RT-PCR on RNA prepared from different mouse tissues. Consistent with previous reports (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999;Huot et al., 2001), we observed two amplicons of 336 and 249 bp in brain, liver and kidney while in heart and muscle a single amplicon of 417 bp harbouring an additional muscle specific 81 bp stretch (Khandjian et al., 1998) was observed. In Xenopus, only a single 457 bp amplicon was detected in brain, liver and kidney, but heart and muscle displayed a 538 bp amplicon containing an additional 81 bp (Fig 2 a). These analyses showed that similarly to human and mouse, an additional exon corresponding to mammalian exon 15 is very likely to be also maintained in the heart and muscle mRNA variant of Xenopus. Northern blot analyses of RNA isolated from various murine tissues revealed the presence of two Fxr1 transcript species estimated at 2.4 and 3.2 kb (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999;Huot et al., 2001;Garnon et al., 2005). The same distribution was also observed for Xenopus tissues (Fig. 2a). We determined that the only difference between the two RNA transcripts in both mouse and frog resides in the presence of either a short or a long 3'-UTR. The short xenopus 3'-UTR (Fig. 3a) corresponds to 244 nt and retains 84% homology with human (254 nt) and 82% with mouse (247 nt). On the other hand, the conserved frog long 3'-UTR counterpart (Fig. 3b) is made of 595 nt and shares 71% and 82% homologies with human (617 nt; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999) and mouse (615 nt; Huot et al., 2001), respectively. These results highlight the importance of maintaining two 3'-UTR in evolution.\n\nTo further study Xenopus Fxr1 RNA, both 457 and 538 bp amplicons were cloned and used as probes to screen a cDNA library prepared from Xenopus laevis tail at stage 30. Ten positive clones were selected and sequence analyses revealed the presence of two cDNA species, one corresponding to the previously characterized xFxr1 cDNA (Siomi et al., 1995), while the second contained an additional 81 nucleotide insert. This short additional sequence was shown to be highly homologous to that of human FXR1 exon 15 (Khandjian et al., 1998;Kirkpatrick et al., 1999). Amino acid alignment of human, mouse and Xenopus revealed that the corresponding proteins are highly conserved during evolution, since 94% similarity and 88% identity in amino acids were observed (Fig. 2b). Of high interest, the 27 aa pocket is maintained in Xenopus and differs from mammalian exon 15 by a single change in amino acid K-568-Q .\n\nIn spite of our efforts to detect additional amplicons no other mRNA spliced variants were identified by RT-PCR analyses, using different Xenopus primers.\n\nThis allows us to propose that in contrast to human and mouse, only two Fxr1 mRNA variants are detected in Xenopus (Fig. 2c).\n\nUsing mAb3FX, the distribution of the different xFxr1p isoforms could be followed throughout the first stages of embryogenesis of Xenopus. While only the shorter 84 kDa was present from stage 0 (fertilisation), the long 88 kDa was detectable after stage 30 (Fig. 4a). Immunohistostaining on sections of both mice and frog embryos were performed using antibody #27-17, specific to the 27 amino acids pocket. At stage 12.5 dpc, mouse embryos showed a positive staining in heart, tongue, and all other striated muscle (Fig. 4b). Similar results were observed in Xenopus embryos at stage 36 as the somites forming the caudal muscle showed a strong positive staining. A clear but small signal was also detected in the eye. As previously reported (Dubé et al., 2000), mFxr1p is detected in granular structures reminiscent of the costameres that contain RNA and proteins (Cripe et al., 1993;Morris and Fulton, 1994;Fulton and Alftine, 1997). This association with these RNP structures is consistent with the RNA-binding properties of Fxr1p. In Xenopus muscles, the same granular distribution was observed (Fig. 4b) indicating again the conserved role of the protein in evolution.\n\nXenopus laevis is a model of choice to study gene functions during early showed no curled phenotype and over 40% recovered their near normal length (Fig. 5c). The short form HA-xFxr1 mRNA was only slightly less effective in rescuing the xFxr1.MO phenotype. For exemple, at 1.5 ng/embryo, 48% of embryos showed no curling (not shown), the phenotype being closely comparable with 0.5 ng of the long mRNA variant (Fig. 5c).\n\nSince high levels of Fxr1p are present in the somites of the swimming tadpole, we investigated the effects of Fxr1.MO injection on the steady states levels of the protein. Two cell embryos were injected with 0.3 pmole of match or mismatch xFxr1.MO in one blastomere and total protein extracted from the dissected head and trunk at stage 36. Using antibody mAb3FX, a single xFxr1p species was detected in the head (anterior) extracts, and this isoform was also present in the trunk (posterior) that contained an additional band corresponding to the larger 88 kDa muscle isoform (Fig. 6a). In xFxr1.MO injected embryos, a ~40% reduction in the level of the shorter 84 kDa xFxr1p was observed in both head and trunk. Given that only half the embryo was injected with xFxr1.MO, this represented a very significant level of silencing. Interestingly, the longer 88 kDa muscle specific isoform was no longer detected. The decrease in xFxr1p levels particularly in the somites of the injected side was further illustrated after immunostaining of a longitudinal section with mAb3FX (Fig. 6b).\n\nTo determine more precisely the stage at which xFxr1p was required for somitic muscle formation, we studied the effects of low doses of xFxr1.MO on the expression of an early muscle marker and somite formation. When two cell embryos were injected with 0.3 pmole of xFxr1.MO in one blastomere, no morphological changes were observed during early embryogenesis, while a mildly curled phenotype was observed from stage 22 to 25 (e.g. see Fig. 5b). At stage 25, embryos showed a diffused pattern of expression of the early mesodermal marker MyoD on the injected side of the embryo (Fig. 7a). More importantly, the normally striped somite pattern of MyoD expression was clearly disrupted, suggesting that segmentation of the trunk mesoderm to form the somites had been affected. This effect was highly specific since the normal striped MyoD expression pattern was fully restored by co-injection of xFxr1 mRNA. In Xenopus, the trunk mesoderm segments in an anterior-posterior sequence, each somite forming by the rotation of a small group of myotomal cells as depicted in figure 7b (Hamilton, 1969;Youn and Malacinski, 1981). By stage 25, 16 somites have already segmented (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967). One overt characteristic of completed somite rotation is the transverse alignment of the nuclei of the myotomal cells in each somite (see Fig. 7b). When the same embryos depicted in figure 7a were longitudinally sectioned and nuclei stained with Hoechst, near normal numbers of myotomal cells were evident. However, somite segmentation and nuclear alignment in myotomal cells was clearly disrupted on the injected side of the embryo. The lack of visible somite boundaries and the random positioning of the myotomal cell nuclei demonstrated that the process of myotomal rotation had been inhibited or at least, significantly delayed. Again, this effect was highly specific since normal somite segmentation and the characteristic alignment of myotomal cell nuclei were rescued by the co-injection of xFxr1 mRNA (right panels in Fig. 7b). In Xenopus, the dermatome initially separates from the myotome as a single layer of mesodermal cells. After somite segmentation these cells remain as an unsegmented primary muscle cell layer underlying the prospective epiderm (Youn and Malacinski,1981). Hoechst staining revealed that the dermatome in xFxr1.MO injected embryos was also disorganized and the dermatomal cell layer appeared thickened (Fig. 7b) as might be expected if somite segmentation and/or the preceding separation of myotome and dermatome had been prevented or delayed.\n\nThese data suggest that xFxr1p may not be required for definition of trunk mesoderm nor for the onset of myotomal cell differentiation, but becomes essential during the formation of functional muscle.\n\nTo determine the impact of the inactivation of xFxr1p on gene expression, 0.6 pmole of xFxr1.MO was injected in both blastomeres of 2 cell stage embryos which were then allowed to develop until stage 30. Macroscopically, embryos inactivated for xFxr1 appeared to be shorter by ~40% as compared to the controls (Fig. 8).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from mock-and MO injected embryos and were simultaneously analyzed with high density cDNA microarrays covering 14 400 genes expressed in Xenopus laevis. Among the genes showing measurable differential levels of expression, a significant change (p≤0,05) of more than 2.5 fold was observed in 409 transcripts, of which 38.4% and 61.6% were respectively upor down-regulated (Fig 9 a and c). Of these 409 genes, 129 (31.8%) have a known function (Fig 9 d and e; also see supplementary Table 1) while 35.4% of the differentially expressed genes have no currently assigned function, nor presented any sequence homology with known genes, whereas the remaining 32.8% showed variable homologies with characterized genes in other organisms with no yet assigned function in Xenopus (Fig. 9d). The known genes (31.8% mRNAs) were subdivided into several functional subcategories (Fig. 9e). 70 % of these mRNAs corresponded to tissue-specific messengers, which reflected the phenotype observed. The others were essentially metabolism-related (18.6%), general developmental factors (15.5%), or cell-cycle related (2.2%). Among the tissuespecific mRNAs, approximately one fifth (19.2%) represented cardiac or striated skeletal muscle-specific messengers, while the remaining mRNAs were linked to the nervous system, eye-specific, skin-and liver-specific (26.2%, 13.1%, 5.4%, 2.3%, respectively). The affected muscle specific mRNAs are presented in Table 1, while the list of the 129 affected mRNAs is available in Supplementary Table 1. To validate the microarray data, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses on mRNAs that were either stable (Fxr1), up-regulated (IRG) or down-regulated (MAP2, MHC, TTR). The results of these analyses (Fig. 9b) are in agreement with the data presented in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nWe have shown that two xFxr1 mRNA variants are detected in Xenopus laevis, as opposed to the 7 previously identified in mammals (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999).\n\nAlthough a simpler animal model, Xenopus displays the same tissue specific expression of a long, 88 kDa, Fxr1p isoform as the 82-84 kDa found in mammals (Khandjian et al., 1998;Dubé et al., 2000). Also, in mouse and frog, the same distribution is observed for Fmrp since the highest levels are present in brain extracts. We observed that Fxr1p expressed in both mouse and frog are highly conserved and antibodies directed against mammalian FXR1P also recognize the frog counterpart. The additional 81 nucleotide stretch (Khandjian et al., 1998) corresponding to mammalian exon 15 (Kirkpatrick et al., 1999) is also detected in Xenopus striated muscle and heart mRNAs. Twenty six out of the 27 aa composing the pocket coded by this muscle specific exon are maintained in frog, mouse and human (Fig. 2b). This pocket was also detected recently in Zebrafish zFxr1p (Engels et al., 2004;Tucker et al., 2004). Conservation in such distant species supports the notion that FXR1P serves an essential function. However, the tissue specific expression of the long Fxr1p isoform is regulated early during embryogenesis, since though we observed that it is already present in developing striated muscle of 12.5 dpc mouse embryos (48 to 52 somite pairs) while in Xenopus it is detected only after stage 25-30, when 16 to 25 somites have already formed (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967). This suggest that it is not essential for the formation of functional somatic muscle and is hence perhaps a special adaptation to support later stages of muscle differentiation, maintenance or growth.\n\nTo inactivate xFxr1 mRNA, we used the Morpholino TM approach, since these molecules are highly specific, stable and are known for their low level of toxicity when compared to other methods of inactivation (Summerton and Weller, 1997).\n\nMoreover, the Morpholinos specifically block translational activity by interacting with the targeted mRNA in a RNAse H-independent manner and thus do not alter its steady state level (Summerton, 1999). The strategy was to inject one or two blastomeres of the 2-cell stage embryos, knowing that the first cleavage furrows delimits the dorso-ventral axis that determines the left and right sides of the embryo (Klein, 1987). Interestingly, phenotypic effects were observed only after stage 22, corresponding with the first stages in somitogenesis (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967), but well before the expression of the muscle specific long xFxr1p isoform. The external curled phenotype corresponded with an inhibition or a significant delay in the formation of the somites and was proportional with the level of xFxr1p silencing. Embryos injected with 0.3 pmole xFxr1-MO did not show a significant loss of presomitic muscle tissue, but did display an abnormal formation of the somites, implying that a certain minimal level of xFxr1p is required to complete myogenesis. This phenotype, and even more severe phenotypes in which trunk muscle tissues was severely reduced, could be rescued by complementation with the muscle specific long form of xFxr1 mRNA. Co-injection of 1.5 ng of this mRNA together with 1.0 pmole of the xFxr1.MO, which silenced both long and short forms, resulted in the rescue of ~80% of the injected embryos as their morphology could be corrected (Fig. 5) and expression of MyoD (Fig. 7) and xFr1p\n\n(data not shown) were restored. However, about 50% rescue could also be achieved by co-injecting the mRNA encoding the short xFxr1p isoform. This is consistent supplementary Table 1). These results underline the important role Fxr1p also plays in the control of nervous system development, a role probably interrelated to that in muscle. Finally, 13.1% of the modulated mRNAs were eye-specific and all showed a down regulation. Indeed, our preliminary results show that xFxr1p is expressed in the developing Xenopus eye and its inactivation most probably has significant consequences on the development of the retina and lens since down regulation of mRNA levels related to the occular apparatus, such as crystallins (Brunekreef et al., 1997;Smolich et al., 1994) or Otx5 (Vignali et al., 2000) is observed. Moreover, downregulated proteins such as tyrosinase-related 1 (Kumasaka et al., 2003), retinol-binding protein (Quadro et al., 1999) are implicated in retina pigmentation, while down regulation of cone arrestin (Craft et al., 1995) and Retinal G proteincoupled receptor (Jockusch et al., 2003) are likely to affect signal transduction in the differentiated eye. However, the phenotypes associated with this downregulation would not be observed until much later developmental stages than studied here.\n\nIn vertebrate muscle, mFxr1 expression is preferentially restricted to granular structures reminiscent to costamere like structures (Dubé et al., 2000), and this distribution is conserved in lower organisms such as the zebrafish (Engels et al., 2004). These costameric structures have been reported to contain specific mRNAs as well as proteins implicated in muscle contraction and maintenance and are thought to be reservoirs of mRNA required for local de novo protein synthesis (Cripe et al., 1993;Morris and Fulton, 1994;Fulton and Alftine, 1997;Jockusch et al., 2003). It is tempting to draw a parallel between FMRP and FXR1P functions in two different highly polarized and large cells such as neurons and muscle cells. In neurons, FMRP is thought to maintain certain classes of mRNAs in a repressed state during their transport in motile granules through neurites to their destinations, the synapses (Antar et al., 2004;De Diego Otero et al., 2002;Mazroui et al., 2002).\n\nThese cargoes are then targeted and anchored to dentritic spines or filopodia, which are the sites where FMRP may regulate synthesis of proteins essential for spine development and maintenance (Antar et al., 2004;Miyashiro et al., 2003;Weiler et al., 2004). Similar to FMRP in neuron, FXR1P may play an equivalent role in muscle to maintain silent mRNAs in costameres until protein synthesis is required.\n\nWe propose that in neuron, FMRP is not essential for its development, since the homologs FXR1P and FXR2P, which colocalize to the same repressed granules (De Diego Otero et al., 2002;Mazroui et al., 2002) could partially compensate for the absence of FMRP in fragile X syndrome. In contrast, as FXR1P is the sole member of the FXR protein family to be found in muscle (Khandjian et al., 1998;Bakker et al., 2000) its presence, as seen in the xenopus experimental system, is essential for muscle development and maintenance. Given that xFxr1p silencing leads to down regulation of many muscle specific mRNAs, our data strongly suggest that as an RNA-binding protein, it might control specific mRNAs that are translated into proteins essential for muscle differentiation. Alternatively, xFxr1p might control a restricted number of mRNAs upstream of a complex cascade event leading to the alteration of the steady state levels of a high number of downstream transcripts. We believe that the xenopus experimental system is a unique model to study whether FMR1P or FXR2P, that both have similar functions as FXR1P, could rescue the phenotype induced by xFr1p depletion, and thus to determine whether FXR1P and FMRP target a different spectrum of mRNAs. Work in this direction is in progress.\n\nAlthough Laggerbauer et al. (2001) have previously reported that FMRP, but not FXR1P, induces translation repression of reporter constructs in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, recent results from Garnon et al. (2005) demonstrate that FXR1P does operate also as a repressor. Our working hypothesis is that the 3 members of the FXR family, regulate both mRNA stability and translation either individually or in concert, according to their differential levels and expression in various cells, and in this way are able to function in targeting these mRNAs to given subcellular regions. Work is in progress to reevaluate the potential repression activity of FXR1P, as we believe that the muscle model will allow us to uniquely characterize the FXR1P RNA targets without interferences from the two other FMRP and FXR2P members. .
