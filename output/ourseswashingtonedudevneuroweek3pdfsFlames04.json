Neuregulins contain an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif that activates membrane-associated tyrosine kinases related to the EGF receptor (also known *Correspondence: o.marin@umh.es as ErbB1). NRG1 directly binds to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, which alone or in combination with ErbB2 mediate a large range of functions (Buonanno and Fischbach, 2001;Falls, 2003). In the central and peripheral nervous system, NRG1 signaling is of central importance for glial cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Adlkofer and Lai, 2000; Buonanno and Fischbach, 2001; Garratt et al., 2000). In neurons, NRG1 functions range from the control of proliferation to late differentiation events such as the regulation of ligand-and voltagegated channels' expression (reviewed in Buonanno and Fischbach, 2001). In cortical structures such as the cerebellum and the neocortex, NRG1 signaling is important for the formation and maintenance of radial glial cells, which in turn are required to support neuronal migration (Anton et al., 1997;Rio et al., 1997;Schmid et al., 2003). Interestingly, NRG1 directly promotes the motility of Schwann cells (Mahanthappa et al., 1996;Meintanis et al., 2001), raising the possibility that it may also play a similar role for some neuronal types. Here, we present evidence that NRG1 is a chemoattractive factor for MGE-derived neurons and that NRG1/ErbB4 signaling plays a prominent role in the directional guidance of GABAergic interneurons from the subpallium to the developing cortex. the possibility that ErbB4 and its high-affinity ligand, ErbB4 Receptor in the Developing Telencephalon during the Period NRG1, might be involved in controlling cortical interneuof Interneuron Migration to the Cortex ron migration. The Nrg1 gene is subject to differential Serial coronal sections through the telencephalon of E13.5 embryos promoter usage and alternative splicing, resulting in the showing mRNA expression for ErbB4, Nrg1-CRD, Nrg1-Ig, Sema3A, expression of distinct protein isoforms (Buonanno and and Sema3F.

Thus, MGE-derived cells preferred a Nrg1-CRDexpressing substrate, suggesting that NRG1-CRD may play a permissive role in the guidance of interneurons toward the cortex.

As a control, derived from the MGE were attracted toward the cortical explant (Marı ´n et al., 2003; Wichterle et al., 2003). In aggregates of GFP-expressing COS cells were placed on the opposite side of the slices (Figure 4A). Cell aggre-contrast, MGE cells expressing dnErbB4 became largely unresponsive to the cortical attractant, as revealed by gates expressing Nrg1-Ig attracted migrating interneurons toward the ventrolateral telencephalon (Figures 4B the roughly 45Њ angle of migration adopted by the electroporated cells in the presence of a cortical explant and 4C), diverting them from their normal route of migration toward the cortex (n ϭ 25). Similar results were ob-(41 Ϯ 4.4 [average Ϯ SE]; n ϭ 13; Figures 5A and 5C). It is of note that the rate of migration of GFP/dnErbB4-tained when heparin beads soaked in recombinant NRG1 protein were used instead of cell aggregates (Supplemen-expressing cells was indistinguishable from that observed in cells electroporated with GFP alone (data not tal Figure S3 at http://www.neuron.org/cgi/content/full/44/ 2/251/DC1/). Control beads did not modify the migration shown), suggesting that expression of dnErbB4 does not nonspecifically impair cell migration.

We next analyzed the pattern of migration of MGE 20; Supplemental Figure S3B). Thus, MGE-derived cells migrating toward the cortex are attracted by secreted cells expressing the dnErbB4 in slice cultures. For this set of experiments, we focally electroporated the MGE NRG1. of slices obtained from E13.5 brains and analyzed the distribution of migrating cells after 36 hr in culture (Marı ´n ErbB4 Function Is Required for Interneuron Migration In Vitro et al., 2001) (Figure 5D).

In contrast, in slices electroporated with both Gfp and dnErbB4, most derived interneurons expressing a dominant-negative form of ErbB4 (dnErbB4) (Jones et al., 1999). In a three-GFP-expressing cells failed to migrate to the neocortex and hippocampus (fewer than ten cells in the cortex in dimensional matrix, cells derived from an isolated E13.5 MGE explant migrated uniformly in all directions (see, 16 of 19 slices) and instead accumulated in the basal telencephalon (Figures 5F and 5FЈ). These results sug-for example, Figure 3A). Thus, when an explant was subdivided into eight sectors of equal size, migrating gest that decreased ErbB4 signaling interferes with the normal pattern of interneuron migration to the cortex cells within each of these sectors dispersed with an angle of roughly 45Њ (46 Ϯ 4.35 [average Ϯ SE]; n ϭ 6; and are in agreement with the hypothesis that NRG1 signaling through ErbB4 receptors mediates the migra-Supplemental Figure S4 at http://www.neuron.org/cgi/ content/full/44/2/251/DC1/).

Moreover, similar to ErbB4 Ϫ/Ϫ HER4 heart mutants, the number of migrating mice (Figures 7A and 7B). Nevertheless, immunohistochemical analysis using anti-GABA antibodies demon-interneurons in the cortex of Nrg1 conditional mutants was also reduced at E14.5 (data not shown). Thus, the strated a significant decrease in the number of GABAϩ cells in the postnatal cortex of rescued ErbB4 mutant embryonic phenotypes of the two mutant lines fully support the in vitro evidence that ErbB4/Nrg1 signaling par-mice compared to controls (n ϭ 3; Figures 7C and 7D).

The decrease mice develop to adulthood, allowing the examination of migrating toward the cortex expresses ErbB4. In the LGE, these cells move through a corridor that expresses a membrane bound form of NRG1, which may act as a permissive cue for their migration. Moreover, the developing cortex expresses a diffusible isoform of NRG1, which in vitro acts as a potent attractant for MGEderived cells. Furthermore, loss of ErbB4 or NRG1 function perturbs interneuron migration to the cortex and alters the number of GABAergic interneurons in the postnatal cortex. Consequently, we suggest that NRG1/ ErbB4 interactions mediate both short-and long-range attraction for tangentially migrating interneurons at different stages of their journey and that this signaling system is required for the normal development of a subpopulation of cortical interneurons. supporting elements necessary for the radial migration GABAergic Interneurons in the Postnatal Cortex of neocortical projection neurons and cerebellar gran-Coronal sections through the parietal cortex of P20 control (A and C) and ErbB4 mutant (B and D) mice.
