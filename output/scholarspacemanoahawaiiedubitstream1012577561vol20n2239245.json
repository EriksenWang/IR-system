    "abstract": "The Ross Ice Shelf is a floating ice mass about 200m thick over an average depth along the barrier of 567 m. In January the prevailing wind blows. from the east, parallel to the coast. The wind current transports the low saliniry layer (ca. 50 m) toward the ice shelf, where it must descend. Directly off the barrier we find low salinities to a depth of 150 m. The circulation here is quite similar to that defined by Sverdrup along the shelf ice of Queen Maud Land. Because of sinking of the low saliniry layer near the barrier , diatoms live in abundance at subcompensation depths, Trigonium arcticum actually on the sea bed.",
    "full_text": "THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY of the Ross Sea is fringed by floating ice of the Ross Ice Shelf except for the relatively small McMurdo Sound-Ross Island area. The clifflike barrier of the ice shelf is about 200 m thick (Sullivan, 1957). An average of 35 m rises from the surface of the water and about 165 m are submerged. The average depth along the barrier is 567 ill. The width of the shelf in places exceeds 1300 km. Since water can circulate beneath this huge ice mass we can expect unique features of circulation.\n\nThe Ross barrier is washed by the Circumpolar Countercurrent which is produced partly by the distribution of density and partly by the prevailing wind. This current is usually weak along the barrier, but as it sweeps around Cape Adare it often attains a velociry of about 3 knots (author's observation). The data shown in Table 2 for station G-l indicate that at this station a weak current is flowing toward the east. This supports the postulation of Kort (1962), who projected such a current through the vicinity of this station.\n\nIn all, three stations were taken off Kainan Bay (Ross Ice Shelf) along a north -south line at distances of 0, 40, and 156 km (Fig. 1).\n\nTwo of these were taken in EDISTO and one in GLACIER. The work was carried out under the general supervision of Dr. Willis 1. Tressler of the U. S. Navy Oceanographic Office. Several vertical plankton tows were made with a 20mesh closing net at stations Ed-l and Ed-2 . The water column was sampled at all three of these stations. The results of these casts are shown in Tables 1 2 and 2 respectively. 2 Because of the wide variation in the size of biota the terms many, common, and few are used to connote relative quantitative abundance.

Th ey were preserved for later examination at station Ed-2. Th e pr esence of diatoms at depths of 200-300 m and deeper engendered a desire to inquire into the reason for this apparent phenomenon.\n\nTh e author is grateful to Dr. W. 1. Tressler and to Mr. J. Q. T ierney, both of the U. S. N avy Oceanographic Office, for data and help in identi fying biota.\n\nAccording to Sverdrup ( 1953a) the threshold requirement in energy for Coscinodiscus excentricus is 0.002 lys. min-I. Schreiber (1927) calculated 0.00172 lys. m in'? for Biddulphia m obiliensis, the lowest energy requirement for a diato m of which there is a record. N o micrometeorological data were taken. H owever, List's tables (1951 ) show an albedo of 14 % under average conditions similar to those which existed off the Ross Ice Shelf at the time of observation on January 21, wit h 0.383 lys. mi n'\" refr acted into the sea. Considerably less energy reached Cape Crozier on February 28-1 month later. To determine the comp ensation depth, the coefficient of absorp tion for visible radiation is calculated from the Poole-Atkins (1929) equation:\n\n-k = 1.17.D -! where D = transparency by secchi disk ( in meters ) .\n\n-k = 4.2 X 10-3 cm with a transparency of 4.\n\nThe comp ensation dept h is found from the equation :\n\nwhere I , = threshold requirement in energy (1.72 X 10-5 lys. rnin\"), and 1 0 = energy refract ed into the sea (3.83 X 1O-! lys. mi n\" ).\n\nThen : z = -12.65 . m (compensation depth), Because transparency in Antarctic waters is primarily a func tion of population densities, -k = 4.2 X 10-3 is valid only for the upper 4 m. H owever, considering the density of p opulations at lower depths, it is axiomatic that Corethron crioph ilum, for example, cannot be fixing carbon by photosynth esis at dept hs in excess of 300 m. Still, at statio n Ed-I th is diatom and Coscinodiscus sp. A occurred t hroughout all sampl ed layers of the water column.

Moreover, it occurred in bottom surface samples together with fragments of decaying algae. An investigation was the n made of vertical circu lation at station Ed-I , to determine if sink -ing could account for these biota living beneath the compensation depth. According to Vowinckel (1957) the prevailing wind at Kainan Bay (Little Amer ica), Ross Ice Shelf, is easterly during the month of January. Considering the magnitude of the Coriolis force at th is high latitude, it seems the light shallow layer would be trans -ported toward the shelf ice under th e influence of the wind stress. Continuity, th en, require s a descending m otion off the ice shelf. Accordin g to Sverdrup ( 1953b) th is means that close to an ice shelf we can expect a th ick layer of water of low salinity.\n\nTo determ ine the rate of sinking at station Ed-I, the procedure of Sverdrup (195 3b) in his investigation of vertical transport of wate r in the vicinity of the ice shelf at Maudheim (Ant arctica) was used :\n\nwhere T =stress of the wind, s =water density, w = angu lar velocity of the earth, ep = latitude of th e observer.\n\nwhere V =wind velocity, em sec\" 1 , SI = density of the air, K = factor of proportionality = 2.6 X 10-3 •\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n(3) Accord ing to Vowi nckel (1957) the prevai ling wind at Kainan Bay (Little America ) during the month of J anuary is easterly. The average velocity is 10 kn ots or 510 em sec'\" . Assum ing this value for V and 78°for ep we obtain: T = 7.0 X 10 3 ern\" sec'\" ....\n\nwhe re T = total volume of transport across a 1 em-wide surface.\n\nIf sinking takes pla ce uniformly from the barr ier to an arbitrary distance of 10 km ( = 10 6 em) , the average downward velocity will be 7.0 X 10-3 em sec\" . At this velocity water requires 14 X 10 6 seconds, or about 16 days, to sink 100 m. This is comparable with Sverdrup's  calculation ( 1953b) of 20 days for 150 m at . Maudheim. Probable circulation is show n in Figure 2.\n\nVertical circula tion on the above scale can exp lain the presence of diatoms at subcornpe nsation dep ths and elsewhere throughout the water column at Ed-I. While Cape Crozier is adjacent to the R oss Ice Shelf, a somewhat different pa ttern of circulation can be expected along a land  mass. But plankton would , noneth eless, be swept past it in all layers. H owever, the diatom T .\n\narcticum is found only on the bott om and nowhere else in the water column.\n\nAccording to Hendy (1937) many specimens of T. arcticum spend most of the time as b ott om forms and seldom get into the plankton. At several stations in Vinc enn es Bay the auth or found many on the bottom and none in the plankton. Hendy also mentions that many specimens are epiphytic on algae. H ow then can this plant fix carbon in the absence of radiant energy ?\n\nThe fact that algae which appear to be decomposing are found in association with T.\n\narcticum suggests the possibility of saprophytic nutrition. According to Kud o ( 1954) organisms ( for example, Euglena gracilis and Chilomonas paramecium ) receive saprophytic nutrition by diffusion thr ough the body surface. This is accomplished with out any organellae. Th ere is only one known except ion-marine dinoflagellates-in which saproph ytic nutrition is accomplished through a special organella. According to Dr. E. W . Putman\" (conve rsatio n) , 3 Chairman, D epartment of Plant Physiology, Un iversity of H awaii.\n\nT. arcticum may well be a saproph yte when not photosynth esizing.\n\nAn int eresting by-product of this investigation is shown in Figure 3. Th e high content of oxygen in the surface layers is pr obably due to the abundant popul ation of holophytic orga nisms.\n\nTh e circulation pattern off the R oss Ice Shelf is nearl y identical with that found by Sverdrup (1953 b) to exist off the shelf ice of Queen Maud Land.\n\nIt is obvious to anyone interested in plankton ecology that organisms at subeuphotic depths cannot fix carb on and cannot be holophytic. Hence, T rigonium arcticum, under the conditions in which it was found, cannot fix carb on and be holoph ytic. Th is fact has been kn own at least since 1937 (H endy) . Still, no att empt has been made to exp lain how such plants do manage to live in virtual extinction of visible radiation. It is likely, then, that thi s diatom, and possibly others, may be capable of using chemical energy deriv ed from decaying algae as a means of nut rition.\n\nContribution No. 135, Hawaii Institute •of Geophysics, University of Hawaii, Honolulu.
