    "abstract": "Transport of viruses from cell to cell in plants typically involves one or more viral proteins that supply dedicated movement functions. Transport from leaf to leaf through phloem, or long-distance transport, is a poorly understood process with requirements differing from those of cell-to-cell movement. Through genetic analysis of tobacco etch virus (TER potyvirus group), a nove1 long-distance movement factor was identified that facilitates vascular-associated movement in tobacco. A mutation in the central region of the helper component proteinase (HC-Pro), a TEV-encoded protein with previously described activities in aphid-mediated transmission and polyprotein processing, inactivated long-distance movement. This mutant virus exhibited only minor defects in genome amplification and cell-to-cell movement functions. In situ histochemical analysis revealed that the mutant was capable of infecting mesophyll, bundle sheath, and phloem cells within inoculated leaves, suggesting that the long-distance movement block was associated with entry into or exit from sieve elements. The long-distance movement defect was specifically complemented by HC-Pro supplied in trans by a transgenic host. The data indicate that HC-Pro functions in one or more steps unique to long-distance transport.",
    "full_text": "Spread of plant viruses from sites of initial infection to dista1 sites can be conceptualized as a multistep process. First, initially infected cells must support viral replication to supply infectious material for subsequent movement. Second, the virus or viral genome must move from cell to cell through intercellular connections, the plasmodesmata, within the initially infected leaf. Third, the virus must move through severa1 vasculature-associated cell types and enter the sieve elements, where movement occurs passively over long distances within the same leaf and between organs. Finally, the virus must exit the sieve elements and reestablish replication and cell-to-cell movement in tissues distant from the initial infection site.\n\nCell-to-cell transport requires the activities of movement proteins (MPs) encoded by viruses (Hull, 1991;Maule, 1991;Deom et al., 1992). It has been proposed that the tobamovirus and dianthovirus MPs bind directly to their respective genomes and facilitate passage through plasmodesmata (Citovsky et al., 1990(Citovsky et al., , 1992;;Fujiwara et al., 1993;Giesman-Cookmeyer and Lommel, 1993;Waigmann et al., 1994). Severa1 viruses, including those in the potexvirus and hordeivirus groups, encode multiple MPs, among which the required movement activities are dispersed (Petty et al., 1990;Beck et al., 1991). For some viruses, such as comoviruses, the MPs form intercellular tubules through which intact virions pass (van Lent et al., 1990;Kasteel et al., 1993). The bipartite geminiviruses move between cells through the coordinated activities of two MPs, one that To whom correspondence should be addressed.\n\nshuttles viral DNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and another that facilitates plasmodesmal transit (Noueiry et al., 1994;Pascal et al., 1994). The potyviruses, as exemplified by tobacco etch virus (TEV), differ from each of the aforementioned models in that proteins with dedicated movement functions have not been identified. The P1 protein has been proposed extensively in the literature to function as the potyviral MP, but deletions and modifications of the P1 coding sequence have little direct effect on movement (Verchot andCarrington, 1995a, 1995b). On the other hand, the cell-to-cell movement functions have been hypothesized as being performed by the capsid protein based on the results of mutational analyses (Dolja et al., 1994(Dolja et al., , 1995)).\n\nRecent evidence suggests that long-distance transport of TEV involves viral functions distinct from those necessary for cell-to-cell movement. Different domains within the capsid protein (263 amino acid residues) have been shown to play specific roles in cell-to-cell and long-distance transport (Dolja et al., 1994(Dolja et al., , 1995)). The core domain, which is required for assembly of the flexuous rod-shaped virions, is absolutely required for cell-to-cell movement. In contrast, the N-terminal(29 residues) and C-terminal(l8 residues) regions, which comprise surfaceoriented domains not required for assembly, are dispensable for cell-to-cell transport but necessary for long-distance movement. Mutants that lack either terminal domain move from cell to cell in primary infection foci but are incapable of vascularassociated movement. These data suggest that the TEV capsid protein interacts with unique cellular and/or viral factors during cell-to-cell and long-distance transport.\n\nHere, we identify the helper component proteinase (HC-Pro) of TEV as a trans-acting factor that plays a specific role in longdistance transport. Potyvirus HC-Pro is a multifunctional protein that has been characterized as a helper factor for acquisition and transmission of virus by aphids (Figure 1; reviewed by Riechmann et al., 1992;Shukla et al., 1994). The helper component domain encompasses at least the N-terminal and central regions, which also contain determinants involved in genome amplification and pathogenicity (Thornbury et al., 1990;Atreya et al., 1992;Atreya and Pirone, 1993;Dolja et al., 1993;Klein et al., 1994). The C-terminal one-third of HC-Pro comprises a cysteine-type proteinase domain that catalyzes autoproteolytic cleavage between itself and the neighboring P3 protein during maturation of the viral polyprotein (Carrington et ai., 1989a(Carrington et ai., , 1989b)). A model in which HC-Pro provides specific movement functions associated with phloem transport of virus is proposed.

The proteinase domain within HC-Pro is shown as a thick bar; indicated are the relative positions of Cys-345 and His-418 at the active site.

Each mutation resulted in substitution of Arg-Pro-Ala for a tripeptide within the central region of HC-Pro. The tripeptides selected for substitution were among the most highly conserved sequences within the central region. The resulting viruses encoded the P-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter protein between P1 and HC-Pro. Cleavage sites recognized by P1 and Nla proteinases were engineered at the sequences encoding the N and C termini of GUS, respectively, to ensure proteolytic remova1 of GUS from both P1 and HC-Pro (Dolja et ai., 1992;Carrington et al., 1993). The addition of the GUS coding sequence to the viral genome was shown to have relatively minor effects on the systemic infection capabilities of TEV (Dolja et al., 1992).\n\nTo determine the effects of the mutations on HC-Pro autoproteolytic function, the sequences encoding a 130-kD GUSIHC-Prolpartial P3 polyprotein were excised from each of the parental and mutant full-length plasmids and subcloned into the vector pTL7SN.3 for in vitro transcription and translation. In addition to subclones containing the three mutations in the central region of HC-Pro, a plasmid was constructed that contained a substitution of a Ser codon for the active site His-418 codon within the proteolytic domain (termed the H722S mutation), a modification that inactivates HC-Pro processing activity (Oh and Carrington, 1989). Transcripts from each plasmid were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The polyprotein containing the wild-type HC-Pro sequence underwent autoproteolysis to yield a 120-kD GUSIHC-Pro product (Figure 2A, lane l), whereas the H722S mutant 130-kD polyprotein was stable (lane 2). The polyproteins harboring the CCCE, FRN, and IGN substitutions were processed to yield 4 2 0 -k D products that comigrated with the wild-type product (Figure 2A, lanes 3 to 5), indicating that these mutations had little or no effect on HC-Pro proteolytic activity.\n\nThe effects of the FRN, CCCE, and IGN mutations on genome amplification were measured. Full-length transcripts representing the parental TEV-GUS and mutant genomes were used to inoculate tobacco protoplasts, and GUS activity was assayed at time intervals postinoculation (pi). GUS activity, which accumulates to significant levels only in cells supporting virus replication, has proven to be an effective quantitative marker for genome amplification (Carrington et al., 1993;Dolja et al., 1994;Restrepo-Hartwig and Carrington, 1994; Li and\n\nA 130-kD C 120-kD C GUS -Pro Tl HC-Pro TP3 GUS cs Wt ffi XJ HC-Pro P3\n\ni n\n\nCarrington, 1995). The FRN mutant was amplified to levels comparable to parental TEV-GUS at 48 hr pi, although a modest reduction was observed at 72 hr pi (Figure 3A). Cells inoculated with the VNN mutant, which contains a replicationdebilitating mutation affecting the Nib polymerase (Carrington et al., 1993;Li and Carrington, 1995), failed to accumulate significant GUS activity. The CCCE and IGN mutants were amplified to levels ~25 and 1%, respectively, of that of the parental virus at 72 hr pi (Figure 3B). Although IGN mutant-induced GUS activity was low, it was significantly greater (P < 0.03) than the minimal activity in VNN mutant-inoculated cells at all time points tested. These results indicate that the FRN and CCCE mutations had only modest effects on genome amplification, whereas the IGN mutation resulted in a more serious amplification defect. ; lanes 1 and 2) or TEV-infected (V; lane 3) plants were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-HC-Pro serum. The immunoreaction was detected using a chemiluminescent second antibody and autoradiography. Ten times more of the transgenic extracts were loaded compared with the virus-infected extract.\n\nTobacco plants were inoculated with transcripts of TEV-GUS and mutant genomes, and systemic infection was assayed by the appearance of symptoms and detection of GUS activity at 12 days pi. Symptoms of parental TEV-GUS infection were observed in most plants by 5 days pi (Figure 4A). Plants inoculated with transcripts from the FRN and IGN mutant genomes exhibited mild symptoms, and these were delayed by at least 2 days, compared with the appearance of parental TEV-GUS symptoms. No symptoms of infection were detected in CCCE mutant-inoculated plants. GUS activity was detected in leaves two positions above the inoculated leaves of plants infected with parental TEV-GUS and the FRN and IGN mutants, although the levels of activity differed greatly among plants inoculated with the different viruses (Figure 4B). Accumulation of the FRN and IGN mutants was approximately two and four orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than that of parental TEV-GUS. The levels of GUS activity among individual FRN and IGN mutant-infected plants were also quite variable. Among plants inoculated with the FRN and IGN mutants, at least one failed to exhibit GUS activity in upper leaves, even though analysis of inoculated leaves indicated that infection had occurred. The differences between TEV-GUS and the FRN and IGN mutants were highly significant (P < 0.0001 in all comparisons). Because these two mutants were debilitated in plants to a greater degree than in protoplasts, they appeared to possess slow or debilitated cell-to-cell and/or long-distance movement phenotypes.\n\nNo GUS activity was detected in upper leaves of CCCE mutant-inoculated plants (Figure 4B), even at 16 days pi (data not shown). All inoculated leaves had GUS activity, however, indicating that this virus may have been confined to initial infection sites. Considering both the protoplast and whole-plant results, the CCCE mutant appeared to display a significant defect in systemic infectivity. Because of this striking phenotype, the movement characteristics of the CCCE mutant were analyzed in greater detail. Cell-to-Cell Movement of TEV-GUS and the CCCE\n\nThe cell-to-cell movement rates of parental TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant were measured in inoculated leaves. lnfection foci were visualized at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr pi by infiltration with the GUS histochemical substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl P-D-glucuronide (X-gluc). The diameters of foci were determined microscopically and expressed in numbers of epidermal cells. At 24 hr pi, the mean diameters of foci produced by TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant were similar (P = 0.57), although many foci consisted of single cells in both cases (Figure 5A). Cell-to-cell movement of the CCCE mutant continued at an average rate of 0.12 cells per hr, which was slightly slower than the parental TEV-GUS rate of 0.23 cells per hr. Measurements of TEV-GUS foci were not possible at 96 hr pi due to extensive secondary movement through the vasculature. These data indicate that the CCCE mutant was capable of cell-to-cell movement but at a reduced rate compared with parental TEV-GUS. Continued incubation of TEV-GUS-infected and CCCE mutant-infected plants to 8 days pi showed that parental virus spread throughout the inoculated leaves by cell-to-cell and vascular-associated movement. The CCCE mutant, however, remained confined to initial infection foci (Figure 56). Culturing of the CCCE mutant-infected plants to 16 days pi revealed that foci continued to expand via cell-to-cell movement but failed to exhibit vascular-associated movement (data not shown). The CCCE mutant, therefore, contained a major defect in systemic or long-distance movement.\n\nLong-distance movement through the vasculature first requires passage through a number of distinct cell types, including mesophyll, bundle sheath, and phloem companion cells. The inability to infect vasculature-associated cells would account for the CCCE mutant phenotype. The cell types infected by TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant were examined in sections of Historesinembedded leaf tissue treated with X-gluc. Strong histochemical GUS reactions were detected in bundle sheath and phloem cells of tissue infected by parental (Figures 6A and 66) and CCCE mutant (Figures 6C and 6D) viruses. The reactions were particularly evident in the cytoplasm-dense phloem cells, some of which were companion cells.'This staining appeared not to have resulted simply from the diffusion of the X-gluc reaction product from adjacent infected cells because the intensity of the reaction was often high in the phloem cells and low in neighboring bundle sheath cells. The pattern of staining within virtually all positive cells was confined to the cytoplasm, with little or no leakage of the X-gluc reaction product into the vacuole or the nucleus (Figure 6). These data suggest that the CCCE mutant was capable of reaching phloem cells of inoculated leaves, indicating that the long-distance movement defect was associated with a point later in the movement pathway.\n\nComplementation of the Long-Distance Movement Defect of the CCCE Mutant in HC-Pro-Expressing Transgenic Plants Transgenic plants that expressed the 5' region of the TEV genome, including P1 and HC-Pro sequences, were produced.\n\nA protein with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of authentic HC-Pro was detected in transgenic plants using an anti-HC-Pro serum (Figure 28), indicating accurate processing of the transgenic polyprotein. The bulk level of accumulation of transgenic HC-Pro was -10% that of HC-Pro in TEV-GUS-infected plants.\n\nProtoplasts from transgenic and nontransgenic plants were inoculated with full-length vira1 RNA transcripts. The relative levels of GUS activity induced by TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant were the same in each protoplast preparation (data not shown), indicating that HC-Pro supplied by the transgenic cells had little effect on genome amplification of parental or mutant viruses at the single-cell level.\n\nTransgenic and nontransgenic plants were inoculated with TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant, and systemic infectivity was monitored by symptom production and GUS activity. As previously described, TEV-GUS induced systemic symptoms by 5 days pi in nontransgenic plants, whereas infection by the CCCE mutant failed to result in symptoms. In contrast, both TEV-GUS and the CCCE mutant induced systemic symptoms in 1000/0 of transgenic plants, although symptoms caused by the mutant were delayed by 2 to 3 days (Figure 7A). Indistinguishable levels of GUS activity were detected in transgenic and nontransgenic plants infected by TEV-GUS. GUS activity induced by the CCCE mutant was detected only in transgenic plants (Figure 78) and at a level reduced considerably relative to that in TEV-GUS-infected plants. The same results 100 7\n\nwere obtained using each of two independent transgenic lines (data not shown). Systemic infection by the CCCE mutant was dueto complementation rather than to recombination between the mutant genome and the transgene because inoculation of nontransgenic plants with the virus recovered from transgenic plants resulted in an infection phenotype identical to that of the original CCCE virus derived from transcripts.\n\nTo determine the effect of transgenic HC-Pro on cell-to-cell movement of the CCCE mutant in inoculated leaves, the in situ histochemical assay was conducted at time intervals through 72 hr pi. lnfection of transgenic plants with the CCCE mutant resulted in only modest stimulation of cell-to-cell movement (Figure 8A). Interestingly, cell-to-cell movement of TEV-GUS was suppressed partially in the transgenic plants, resulting in infection foci of sizes comparable to the CCCE mutant at each time point.\n\nSecondary, vascular-associated movement was analyzed in situ in inoculated and noninoculated leaves of transgenic and nontransgenic plants at 13 days pi. Extensive secondary movement was detected in transgenic leaves inoculated with the CCCE mutant, whereas only individual, primary infection foci were visible in nontransgenic plants (Figure 88). Upper noninoculated leaves also exhibited GUS activity radiating from primary veins (Figure 8C), clearly showing vascular-associated movement to systemic tissues. These data indicate that HC-Pro supplied in frans complemented, at least partially, the longdistance movement defect of the CCCE mutant.\n\nO o 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 Days Post-Inoculation TEV-FRN IGNCCCE GUS\n\nPrevious investigations revealed that cell-to-cell movement and long-distance transport of TEV are distinct processes with different requirements (Dolja et al., 1994(Dolja et al., ,1995)). In fact, it has been suggested that these two modes of movement are unique processes in other viral systems as well (e.g., Dawson, 1992;Taliansky and Garcia-Arenal, 1995). Here, we demonstrated that TEV encodes a nonstructural protein, HC-Pro, which provides a specific frans-active function in vascular-associated transport.\n\nThe collective analyses of three mutants indicated that the HC-Pro long-distance movement activity is distinct from the role HC-Pro may play in genome amplification (Table 1). First, the long-distance movement-defective CCCE mutant could amplify in protoplasts to 25% of the level of parental TEV-GUS. Based on results with other TEV-GUS mutants, such as those with defects in the P1 protein (Verchot and Carrington, 1995b), this level of replication within single cells is clearly not debilitating to cell-to-cell or long-distance movement. Second, the IGN mutant encoded a debilitated HC-Pro that resulted in drastically reduced genome amplification levels (<1% compared with parental virus), yet this mutant was capable of limited long-distance movement. The limited systemic infection capability of the IGN mutant may have resulted from decreases in both genome amplification and long-distance movement rates, although it could have been due solely to indirect effects of limited amplification. Because the defect produced by the CCCE mutation had only a minor effect on genome amplification but a completely debilitating effect on long-distance movement (Table 1), these two functions are genetically separable. Finally, the fact that HC-Pro supplied in transgenic cells could restore long-distance movement activity to the CCCE mutant but could not stimulate genome amplification of the CCCE mutant at the single-cell level in protoplasts implies that the movement and replication functions of HC-Pro are distinct.\n\nWhereas the CCCE mutant was complemented in HC-Pro-expressing transgenic plants, it was not restored to the level of the parental virus. This could be due to one or more reasons. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the transgenic plants accumulated HC-Pro to levels 10% of those detected in TEV-GUS -infected plants. The relatively low level of functional HC-Pro may have had a quantitative effect on the long-distance movement function. Alternatively, the CCCE mutant HC-Pro accumulating in infected cells may have been frans-inhibitory to the complementing activity of the transgenic protein. If the movement function of HC-Pro requires multiple domains or binding sites and the CCCE mutation affects only one of these putative domains, then the mutant protein may have partially interfered with the movement process. Such frans-dominant interference was proposed to explain the lack of transgenic complementation of long-distance movement of a TEV mutant lacking the C-terminal domain of capsid protein (Dolja et al., 1995).\n\nA B V , .V;.. How might HC-Pro participate specifically in vascularassociated long-distance movement? It is proposed that longdistance movement of TEV involves an interaction between HC-Pro and capsid protein (or virions). If this were the case, similar movement phenotypes would be predicted if mutations were introduced into either HC-Pro or the capsid protein. Indeed, the CCCE HC-Pro mutant and the mutants lacking the terminal domains of the capsid protein each have the same phenotype: they can amplify and move from cell to cell, but they fail to move long distances. Furthermore, mutants that lack the ability to be transmitted by aphids may possess defects in either the N-terminal or central region of HC-Pro or the N terminus of capsid protein (Atreya et al., 1990(Atreya et al., , 1991(Atreya et al., , 1992;;Thornbury et al., 1990;Atreya and Pirone, 1993;Dolja et al., 1993). Thus, two different processes have similar requirements for both HC-Pro and the capsid protein. However, the aphid transmission-defective mutants referenced previously still possess long-distance movement capability. These data suggest O 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 Days Post-Inoculation Complementation of the CCCE Mutant in Transgenic Plants. TEV-mv-ccc ccc GUS GUS Xan. Tran. Xan.Tran. Nontransgenic (Xanthi or Xan.) or HC-Pro-expressing transgenic (Transgen. or Tran.) plants were inoculated with parenta1 TEV-GUS or the CCCE (CCC) mutant.

(e) GUS activity was quantified in extracts from leaves two positions above the inoculated leaves 12 days pi. Each bar represem the mean from five to seven plants. Activity values from individual plants are indicated.\n\nthat HC-Pro and the capsid protein interact to form active complexes that facilitate insect transmission and long-distance movement but that the nature of the interaction required for each process may differ.\n\nIt is further proposed that the putative HC-Pro-capsid protein interaction provides a unique function in movement through the companion celllsieve element boundary. The histochemical analysis indicated that the CCCE mutant could reach at least as far as the phloem companion cells of inoculated leaves. Therefore, the mutant may have been blocked at the point of entry into sieve elements or at the point of exit from sieve elements back into companion cells at sites dista1 to the-initial infection. The idea that transport across the companion celll sieve element boundary requires a set of unique movement functions is attractive because evidence suggests that plasmodesmata at this junction are quite different from plasmodesmata between mesophyll cells (Kempers et al., 1993). The plasmodesmata between mesophyll cells and between phloem cells were shown, in dye injection experiments, to differ functionally (Ding et al., 1992). In addition, the density of companion celllsieve element plasmodesmata per unit area is relatively low in tobacco (Van Bel and Gamalei, 1992). HC-Pro mayfacilitate transport through these specialized plasmodesmata. We do not know whether HC-Pro also enters the sieve element along with the virion or transport complex. Entry of HC-Pro into sieve elements is clearly plausible, given that MPs from severa1 diverse virus groups are able to move themselves through plasmodesmata (Fujiwara et al., 1993;Noueiry et al., 1994;Waigmann et al., 1994).\n\nA modified form of the highly aphid-transmissible strain of tobacco etch virus (TEV), the genome of which is represented as cDNA in pTEV7DA (Dolja et al., 1992), was used in this study. Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi-nc was used as the host in whole-plant experiments and as the source of protoplasts. All cloning of DNA was conducted in fscherichia coli HBlO1.\n\nTwo independent transgenic tobacco lines, termed 0027-1031-19x8 and 0027-1031-1XB, that expressed the P1-helper component proteinase (HC-Pro) region of the TEV genome were produced using the leaf disc method (Horsch et al., 1985; Carrington and Freed, 1990).

This plasmid also contains the 3-glucuronidase (GUS) coding sequence between the P1 and HC-Pro regions as well as codons for an Nla proteinase cleavage site between GUS and HC-Pro (Carrington et al., 1993). For each mutant, three codons were replaced by the sequence AGGCCTGCT, which contains a Stul site and codes for the tripeptide Arg-Pro-Ala. The mutations affected Phe-182-Arg-183-Asn-184 (FRN), lle-251-Gly-252-Asn-253 (IGN), and Cys-293-Cys-294-Cys-295 (CCCE). The CCCE mutant also contained a substitution of Asp for Glu-299. Mutagenesis was conducted by the oligonucleotide-directed method (Kunkel et al., 1987) and verified by nucleotide sequence analysis.\n\nThe mutations were introduced into a GUS-containing, full-length cDNA of the TEV genome by transfer of the Xbal-Xbal fragment from pTL7SN-0823GiH into pTEV7DAN. The resulting plasmidswere named pTEV7DAN-GiH/FRN, pTEV7DAN-GiH/IGN, and DTEV7DAN-GIH/ CCCE. These plasmids contain a bacteriophage SP6 promoter adjacent to the TEV 5' sequence and a Bglll site adjacent to the 3' poly(A) region.\n\nThe region encoding GUS, mutagenized HC-Pro, and a 10-kD segment of the P3 protein was subcloned from the full-length plasmids described previously into the vector pTL7SN.3 (Carrington and Freed, 1990). These plasmidswere termed pTL7SN-1027GIH/FRN, pTL7SN-1027GiH/IGN, and DTL7SN-1027G1H/CCCE.\n\nFull-length TEV transcripts were generated using SP6 RNA polymerase and Bglll-linearized DMA as described previously (Dolja et al., 1992). These transcripts were used for inoculation of plants and protoplasts.\n\nTranscripts were also produced from the pTL7SN-1027GiH-based plasmids using SP6 RNA polymerase. These transcripts were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 35 S-methionine (Du Pont-New England Nuclear) for 1 hr. The radiolabeled products were subjected to electrophoresis through an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography.\n\nCarborundum-dusted plants were inoculated mechanically using RNA transcripts ( 4 0 wg) or inoculum prepared by grinding 1 g of virusinfected leaves in 2 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6).\n\nProtoplasts were prepared from greenhouse-grown plants and inoculated (7.5 x 105 cells) with SP6 transcripts using the polyethylene glycol method described previously (Negrutiu et al., 1987;Carrington and Freed, 1990). lnoculations were conducted in triplicate, using a single preparation of protoplasts for each experiment. Transcripts derived from pTEV7DAN-GJH (the plasmid yielding TEV-GUS) and pTEV7DAN-G.1 HlVNN served as the positive and negative amplification controls, respectively. The latter contained a mutation within the Nlb polymerase sequence, resulting in an amplification-defective phenotype (Carrington et al., 1993;Li and Carrington, 1995).\n\nProtoplasts (2.5 x 105) were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hr postinoculation (pi), frozen at -80°C, and resuspended in GUS lysis buffer (40 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 0.07°/o p-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), and GUS activity was measured using the fluorometric substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (Jefferson, 1987). GUS activity was also measured using the fluorometric assay in extracts from virus-infected leaves. Leaf tissue was ground in 5 volumes of GUS lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation at 13, OOOg for 10 min.\n\nGUS activity was visualized in virus-infected leaves after vacuum infiltration of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl p-D-glucuronide (X-gluc), a colorimetric GUS substrate (Dolja et al., 1992). In some experiments, infection focus diameter (expressed in number of epidermal cells) was measured (Dolja et al., 1994). Statistical analysis of data was performed using the StatView 4.0 program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA).\n\nlnoculated leaves of nontransgenic tobacco plants were infiltrated with X-gluc at 7 days pi. Tissue near the edge of an infection focus was excised with a razor blade, fixed in 50 mM Pipes, pH 7.4,4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), 05% glutaraldehyde (Sigma), dehydrated through a graded acetone series, and embedded in Historesin (Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany). Sections (6-bm) were cut with glass knives using an Ultracut microtome and mounted in Aqua-polymount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) on glass slides. Sections were viewed with an Olympus 6x50 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) using phase-contrast optics."
