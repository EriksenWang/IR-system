    "full_text": "Production of proteins with pharmaceutical purposes is a developing industry, but the extraction of proteins from their natural source involves risks to health and, depending on the protein, these processes are sometimes inefficient and expensive. Moreover, some proteins are not available naturally. To counteract these aspects, different recombinant systems have been developed during recent years, which include expression of proteins in E. coli, yeast, insect and mammalian cell cultures, as well as transgenic animals and plants [Hood, 2002;Ma et al., 2003;Fischer et al., 2003;Twyman et al., 2003].\n\nEach of these systems has disadvantages [Hood, 2002]: bacteria, fungi and yeast require a high initial input of money, moreover; in the case of bacteria [Twyman et al., 2003], many proteins fail to fold correctly and are either degraded (resulting in low or no yield) or accumulate as insoluble inclusion bodies. In the case of fungi, hyper-glycosylation of proteins [Hood, 2002;Streatfield et al., 2003] can lead to undesired products. Animal cell culture and transgenic animal hosts have the advantage that the expression of the protein is similar to the original provenance, but also involve a high risk of viral diseases, are expensive and only cost effective for highly valuable products [Hood, 2002;Olsen et al., 2003].\n\nIn the last few years, plants were added to systems for production of recombinant proteins, with some successful approaches that make this alternative a viable approach.\n\nAt this point, several plant-derived biopharmaceutical proteins are reaching the stage of clinical trials, including antibodies, vaccines, human blood products, hormones and growth regulators [Fischer et al., 2003;Peterson and Arntzen, 2004;Twyman et al., 2003]. The advantages of plant products include lower costs compared with microbial or animal cells, stability of protein products in storage tissues such as seeds and the possibility of direct addition of plant material to industrial processes [Hood, 2002].\n\nMoreover, plants seems to have the ability for correctly folding and assembling foreign proteins, as the result of a high conservation of protein synthesis pathways [Twyman et al., 2003].\n\nThe first mammalian protein successfully expressed and correctly folded in a transgenic plant was reported by Sijmons and collaborators in 1990 [Sijmons et al., 1990]. These authors achieved secretion of correctly processed human serum albumin from tobacco cells. Since then, many other proteins have been successfully expressed in different crops.\n\nIn the late 80's, assembly of full length serum IgG was realized in tobacco by crossing transgenic plants that expressed, respectively, gamma or kappa chains. The functional antibodies accumulated up to 1.3% of total leaf protein content [Hiatt et al., 1989]. Following the same procedure of crosses among transgenic lines expressing genes for the heavy and light chains, it was possible to synthesize and correctly assemble secretory immunoglobulin A, a process that involved crosses between four transgenic lines of tobacco plants, each of them expressing a different gene necessary for assembly of the dimeric form [Ma et al., 1995]. Also, the immune response in humans against hepatitis B virus was demonstrated after ingestion of transgenic lettuce expressing hepatitis B virus surface antigen [Kapusta et al., 1999].\n\nEarly studies were conducted with model species like tobacco, thereby increasing knowledge of gene regulation and protein synthesis in plants. Recently, higher recombinant protein expression levels were obtained using different crop species like corn, canola, rice, soybean and barley, representing a new industry that can satisfy the exploding demand for recombinant proteins [Fischer et al., 2003;Hood, 2002;Twyman et al., 2003].\n\nCollagens are extensively used as industrial products with such diverse applications as gelatins in the food industry or in medical applications, tissue engineering and wound sealants [Friess, 1998]. This extensive industry uses animal waste as the primary source. Tissues like bone or skin are chemically treated, commonly with alkali, to extract collagen [Olsen et al., 2003]. However, there are concerns about the safety of this material. Some of them involve biocompatibility, viral disease transmission, and the homogeneity of the product, this latter based on the fact that, in nature, collagen I is usually associated with collagen III, and the separation of this two kinds of collagens involves a difficult enzymatic process [Olsen et al., 2003]. Animal-derived collagen can also trigger allergy immune-responses in humans at a rate between 2-4% of the total population [Lynn et al., 2004]. These questions have initiated interest in the development of non-animal resources for production of collagen [Olsen et al., 2003].\n\nCollagens form a superfamily of proteins that are the most abundant extracellular matrix molecules. They are expressed in all tissues of the human body and are involved in many important functions that support the architecture, strength and development of tissues and affect cell attachment, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Collagens play an important role in tissue reparation, acting as a network that helps in the sealing of wounds. On the other hand, an excess can lead to fibrotic diseases in different organs and tissues. The critical role of individual collagens is recognized by the wide spectrum of diseases that have been found as a result of mutations in the molecule coding sequence [Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;van der Rest and Garrone, 1991;Kivirikko, 1993;Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995;Bornstein, 1980] The collagen family of proteins includes 27 different types of collagen that aggregate into at least 38 distinct polypeptides and more than 15 additional proteins with collagen-like domains that account for the most important extracellular component in mammalian systems [Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Keizer-Gunnink et al., 2000;Prockop et al., 1998;Kivirikko, 1993;Olsen et al., 2003] All collagen molecules form supramolecular aggregates that are stabilized in part by triple helical domain interactions [Prockop et al., 1998;Fessler and Fessler, 1978]. Depending on the structure that they form, collagen can be separated into different well-characterized groups (see Table 1.1).\n\nCollagen molecules consist of three polypeptide chains, called α chains, that differ for each collagen type with respect to length and specific amino acid sequence [Bornstein, 1980;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Bateman et al., 1996]. α chains form a left handed helix, in which every third residue comes into the center of the triple helix. For these three chains to go into the center, the third residue must be glycine, since it is the smallest amino acid [van der Rest and Garrone, 1991;Prockop et al., 1998;Kadler et al., 1996;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Brodsky and Ramshaw, 1997].\n\nThe structural similarities between fibrillar collagen are reflected at the gene level, with highly conserved intron-exon structures. Every chain has the repeated sequence Gly-X-Y in which, about 30% of the time X is proline, and Y is 4-hydroxyproline.\n\nThese two amino acids provide stability for the triple helix [Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Brodsky and Ramshaw, 1997;Pakkanen et al., 2003]. The collagen fibrils in tissues are often heterogeneous, containing more than one collagen type. Type I collagen fibrils can frequently be a mixture with trace amounts of collagen types III, V and XII, providing diversity among collagen types. Moreover, heterogeneity is also provided by alternate splicing of collagen polypeptide chains and the use of alternate promoters [Kivirikko, 1993].\n\nType I collagen is part of the group that forms fibrils. It is found in most connective tissues, especially in dermis, bones, tendon and ligament. It is synthesized in response to injury and in nodules formed as consequence of fibrotic diseases [van der Rest and Garrone, 1991;Keizer-Gunnink et al., 2000;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001].\n\nCollagen I (homo-and heterotrimer) is formed by two molecules α1(I) and α2(I).\n\nThe genes that encode for these proteins are named COLA1A1 and COL1A2 and were assigned to chromosome 17q21. 3-22 and 7q21.3-q22, respectively [Bornstein, 1980;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995;Westerhausen et al., 1991].Each chain is made up of 330 Gly-X-Y repeats. At the carboxyl end, a disulfidebonded globule serves as recognition site for trimer assembly and avoids premature fibril formation. This globule is separated from the main helix by a C-protease cleavage site that comprises about 30 residues. At the amino terminal end, a second non-triple helical domain constitutes the N-protease cleavage site [van der Rest and Garrone, 1991] (see Fig. 1.1).\n\nThe biosynthesis of fibril-forming collagens is characterized by the presence of an unusual number of co-translational and post-translational modifications of the polypeptide chains, a unique feature to collagen and collagen-like amino acid sequences [Bornstein, 1980;Kivirikko, 1998;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001].\n\nProcessing of these modifications takes place inside the cell, and also after secretion of procollagen into the extracellular space. The synthesis of α chains and their intracellular modifications give rise to the formation of triple helical procollagen molecules.\n\nAfter secretion, extracellular processing will convert these molecules into cross-linked fibers or supramolecular planar aggregates [Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Bornstein, 1980;Kivirikko, 1980].\n\nRemoval of pre-protein sequences: the pre-pro-α chains are synthesized on membranebound polysomes and, while being assembled, pass through the membrane into the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Procollagens have hydrophobic leader se-quences at their N-terminal amino acid ends that need to be removed at an early stage of processing, thereby transforming the pre-pro-α chain into pro-α chains [Kivirikko, 1980;Bornstein, 1980;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001].\n\nHydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues: these reactions are catalyzed by three different enzymes, namely prolyl 4-hydroxylase, prolyl 3-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. The three proteins hydroxylate prolyl or lysyl residues and require ferrous ions, 2-oxoglutarate, oxygen and ascorbate [Kivirikko, 1980;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Vranka et al., 2004](for reactions, see Fig. 1\n\nProlyl 4-hydroxylase is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum [Myllyharju, 2003;Bassuk and Berg, 1989]. In vertebrates, it has the form of a tetramer α2β2, with a molecular weight of 240kDa and consists of two inactive monomers, namely α and β subunits, the later being identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [Pihlajaniemi et al., 1987].\n\nThe human-α subunit consists of 517 amino acids and a signal peptide of 17 residues, giving rise to a protein of 63kDa that contains the catalytic site for hydroxylation [Kivirikko, 1980;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998]. PDI (55kDa) confers solubility to the α subunit and also catalyzes the thiol/disulfide exchanges in proteins that results in the disulfide bonds essential for protein stability. As a third function, PDI acts as a chaperone that binds the procollagen and inhibits the aggregation of the procollagen chains during translation [Wilson et al., 1998]. When PDI is acting as the β subunit of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer, it retains up to 50% of its protein disulfide isomerase activity [Pihlajaniemi et al., 1987;Vuorela et al., 1997;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001;Myllyharju, 2003].\n\nThe minimum requirement for interaction with prolyl 4-hydroxylase is fulfilled by an X-Pro-Gly tripeptide. The hydroxylation reaction requires Fe 2+ , 2-oxoglutarate, O 2 and ascorbate. The 2-oxoglutarate is stochiometrically decarboxylated during hydroxylation, with one atom of O 2 being incorporated into succinate and the other into the hydroxy group formed on the proline residue [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998].\n\nKinetic studies have concluded that there is a sequential binding of Fe 2+ , 2oxoglutarate, O 2 and the peptide substrate to the enzyme in this order, and also an ordered release of the hydroxylated peptide, CO 2 , succinate and Fe 2+ . Oxygen is probably activated as superoxide. Ascorbate is not consumed stoichiometrically, and P4H can catalyze a number of reactions in its absence. However, when the peptide substrate is present in a saturating concentration, P4H can decarboxylate without hydroxylation of proline and the ascorbate acts as an alternate O 2 acceptor [Kivirikko, 1980;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998].\n\nThe action of prolyl 4-hydroxylase is the key for achieving stability of the procollagen molecule under physiological conditions. Without an appropriate number of hydroxylated Y-position prolyl residues, the newly synthesized chains cannot efficiently fold into a triple helical conformation at 37 • C [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998].\n\nMoreover, if insufficient hydroxylation occurs, the polypeptides will remain non-helical, resulting in their degradation, poor secretion and ineffective self-assembly into collagen fibrils [Pihlajaniemi et al., 1987;Vuorela et al., 1997;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998].\n\nProlyl 3-hydroxylase, also belongs to the group of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and, like prolyl 4-hydroxylase, requires Fe 2+ , 2-oxoglutarate, O 2 , and ascorbate for its activity [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Vranka et al., 2004]. 3-hydroxyproline is found in almost all collagens in the sequence Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly, with the hydroxyl group in the first proline of the tripeptide. The largest amounts of 3-hydroxyproline are found associated with collagen types IV and V, but the occurrence of 3-hydroxyproline is much less frequent than that of 4-hydroxyproline in the total amino acid content of collagens. In basement membrane collagens where 3-hydroxyproline has been reported to be most abundant, the total content is around 115 residues per 1000 residues, which is just 10% of that of 4-hydroxyproline [Vranka et al., 2004].\n\nAs stated above, 4-hydroxyproline, has been shown to be important for the stabilization of the triple helix. In contrast, the role of 3-hydroxyproline in collagens is not well understood. Recent studies conducted on embryonic chick cells showed that P3H1 can be purified from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and also that the enzyme is present in a complex of proteins that specifically bind to denatured collagen. Since the study used a denatured fibrillar collagen as the affinity substrate, and because the prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 immunolocalization correlates it with the presence of fibrillar collagens, it is more likely that the enzyme modifies fibrillar collagens; it also supports the idea that P3H plays an important biological role in the folding and assembly of triple helical collagen [Vranka et al., 2004].\n\nLysyl hydroxylase is an α2 homo-dimer of about 200,000 kDa, that hydroxylates the X-Lys-Gly repeated sequence by a mechanism similar to P4Hs. In human, three isoforms have been isolated (LH1, LH2 and LH3) that have lysyl hydroxylase activity.\n\nThe number of hydroxylated lysyl residues varies among different collagen types and tissues, depending on the physiological condition. The function of these hydroxylysyl groups is to serve as substrates for glycosylation before the chain becomes helical, and they are essential for cross-linking of collagen chains [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Kivirikko, 1980].\n\nGlycosylation of hydroxy-lysyl residues is catalyzed by two enzymes, namely hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase that transfers galactose to hydroxylysyl residues and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase, that transfers glucose to galactosylhydroxylysyl residues [Kivirikko, 1980]. Studies conducted with insect cells and E. coli revealed that glycosylation of some hydroxy-lysyl residues to galactosylhydroxylysine and glucosylgalactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalyzed also by LH3 [Wang et al., 2002].\n\nAsparagine residues in the C-terminal propeptide are likewise glycosylated. After C-propeptides are associated, disulfide bonds are formed and, if an average of 100 4-hydroxyproline residues have been formed on each of the three α chains, a nucleus is formed in the C-terminal region and chain formation is propagated in a zipper-like fashion [Engel and Prockop, 1991].\n\nThe procollagen molecule is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum across the Golgi stacks without leaving the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. During this transfer process, the molecules begin to aggregate laterally, resulting in condensation and formation of granules that will be secreted to the extracellular space [Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995;van der Rest and Garrone, 1991].\n\nExtracellular modifications are enzymatically performed by specific proteinases that cleave the C-and N-propeptides. Both proteinases require calcium as a bivalent cation and, as a result the procollagen molecules are converted into insoluble collagen [McLaughlin and Bulleid, 1998;Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001].\n\nThe collagen molecules aggregate spontaneously into fibrils. Cross-link formation is the last step in the process of collagen synthesis. It involves the oxidative deamination of -amino groups in lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues and is catalyzed by lysyl oxidase.\n\nThe aldehydes generated in the lysyl oxidase reaction can serve either for cross link formation or intramolecular cross-links [Kadler et al., 1987;Kadler et al., 1996;Prockop et al., 1998].\n\nThe long term goal of this research is to produce procollagen I in transgenic barley grains. Several recombinant human and non-human proteins have been expressed in the barley grain, including lysozyme, lactoferrin [van Fleet, 2001] and an engineered heat stable β-glucanase [Horvath et al., 2000]. The aim of the present research is to synthesize components needed for the production of procollagen in the endosperm of transgenic barley.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, this study focuses on two aspects of the production of recombinant collagen in barley. First, a gene codon-optimized for plant expression had to be synthesized and its functionality tested in an eukaryotic expression system.\n\nTowards this goal the COL1A1 gene was synthesized to yield a gene that matched the monocot plants codon usage, with a GC content over 60%, and inserted into a vector for expression in Pichia pastoris. Likewise a vector carrying the genes for prolyl 4-hydroxylase for synthesis of hydroxylated procollagen in the yeast Pichia pastoris had to be constructed and expressed. The second goal was to obtain barley plants containing the genes for procollagen synthesis. Plasmid vectors containing the genes for the assembly of human type I homotrimeric procollagen had to be prepared for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation in barley. The objectives of the study can be summarized as follows:\n\n• Synthesis of plant codon-optimized human gene encoding for α1(I) chain (COL1A1), assembly of the vectors needed for protein expression and expression of correctly assembled homotrimeric human type I procollagen in Pichia pastoris.\n\n• Development of vectors needed for transformation in barley and generation of barley plants containing procollagen I and prolyl 4-hydroxylase genes by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.\n\nThis dissertation is organized into three main chapters. In Chapter 2 I discuss assembly of the gene, development of vectors and the expression of homotrimeric procollagen I and prolyl 4-hydroxylase in Pichia pastoris used as test for the correctness of the construct.\n\nIn Chapter 3 I present the results obtained in the development of the vectors needed for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and preliminary results obtained from the co-cultivation of immature zygotic barley embryos.\n\nTables and figures are presented at the end of each chapter.

For collagen to be correctly expressed, eight specific enzymes are required, among them, prolyl 4-hydroxylase plays a central role, since it catalyzes hydroxylation of prolyl residues that confer thermal stability to the newly synthesized chain. The main objective of this study was to assemble the codon-optimized gene that encodes the (α)1 chain of collagen type I and express this gene in Pichia pastoris. The following specific objectives were addressed: 1. synthesize the gene coding for the α chain of human collagen type I (COL1A1) with codons optimized for translation on barley polysomes in the endosperm; 2. develop the vectors needed for protein expression in Pichia pastoris; and 3. synthesize COL1A1 and prolyl-hydroxylase in Pichia pastoris.\n\nUsing the degeneracy of the genetic code, a collagen gene was designed in silico with nucleotides in the third position of the codons to reach a GC content of 67% as required for optimal translation in the barley endosperm. The gene was assembled with intermediate vectors containing 64 overlapping oligonucleotides that covered both strands of the DNA double helix. Synthesis and secretion from Pichia pastoris was obtained with vectors containing the gene under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter and insertion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α mating type secretion signal for export of the protein into the medium. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with specific antibodies recognizing 25kDa gelatin identified a protein present in the cell lysate and culture medium as unhydroxylated homotrimeric procollagen I. An ELISA test was conducted in order to quantify the amount of protein produced.\n\nCollagen I is a polypeptide composed of three chains: two α chains and one β chain that assemble into a triple helix with a coiled structure [Prockop et al., 1998;Kivirikko, 1980;van der Rest and Garrone, 1991].\n\nSynthesis of collagen involves an unusual number of post-translational modifications, that require at least eight specific enzymes [Fessler and Fessler, 1978;van der Rest and Garrone, 1991;Myllyharju, 2003]. Among these enzymes, prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H), which in vertebrates is an α2β2 tetramer, has a central role: it forms the 4hydroxyproline residues required for folding of the newly synthesized collagen polypeptide chains into triple-helical molecules and thus procures the thermal stability needed for living organisms.\n\nRecombinant collagen has been synthesized in several yeast species, and increasing efforts are being made to develop efficient and safe alternatives to animal-derived collagens. The main advantage of yeasts compared to bacteria lies in their capacity to perform post-translational modifications and efficient secretion of eucaryotic proteins.\n\nYeasts were considered to lack prolyl-hydroxylases; this is the case for Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [de Bruin et al., 2002].\n\nPichia pastoris [Vuorela et al., 1997] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Toman et al., 2000] are able to express hydroxylate and correctly fold the triple helical collagen polypeptide only with transgenic co-expression of the hydroxylation enzymes. However\n\nHansenula polymorpha [de Bruin et al., 2000] synthesizes 4-hydroxyproline and is thus able to form prolyl 4-hydroxylated collagenous domains.\n\nIn the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of α1(I) procollagen without prolyl hydroxylase genes resulted in low levels of expression, but the system was able to generate the triple helical procollagen, thereby opening the possibility that endogenous yeast PDI can assemble the three procollagen polypeptide chains, but in the absence of α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the generated procollagen lacked thermal stability (Tm of 23-25 • C), and was degraded by pepsin. When collagen was expressed with the genes encoding prolyl hydroxylase, the triple helical molecules produced were thermally stable with a Tm 35 • C [Toman et al., 2000] and remained inside the endoplasmic reticulum. This experiment led to the conclusion that the genes needed for the efficient assembly of type I collagen are the ones that encode COL1A1 and COL1A2 chains and both subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Additionally, for higher levels of expression, glutamate was also required as a precursor for the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate.\n\nOn the other hand, studies conducted with Pichia pastoris revealed that production of stable prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer requires expression of collagen type III chains, and at the same time, tetramer assembly is a requisite for stable triple helical collagen formation [Vuorela et al., 1997]. Nevertheless, only 10% of the molecules assembled in Pichia pastoris were secreted into the medium [Keizer-Gunnink et al., 2000], an observation that led to the conclusion that the chains are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum, probably due to the large size of the procollagen molecules.\n\nMyllyharju and collaborators, originally regarded the C-propeptides of procollagens as essential for correct chain recognition and assembly [Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2001], but it was subsequently found that the C-propeptides can be replaced in the Pichia pastoris expression system by foldon, a 29-residue trimerization domain located at the C-terminus of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin molecule [Pakkanen et al., 2003]. Foldon turned out to be more effective in forming procollagen trimers than the C-propeptides. Furthermore, co-expression of α1(I)-foldon and α2(I)-foldon chains led to effective assembly of heterotrimeric molecules with the expected 2:1 chain ratio. As foldon contains no information for chain recognition, the data indicate that chain selection and assembly of procollagen are influenced not only by the C-terminal oligomerization domain but also by determinants present in the central part of the collagen chains.\n\nComparing the expression and secretion of a procollagen I fragment in Hansenula polymorpha and Pichia pastoris led to the conclusion that H. polymorpha can secrete a recombinant human fragment of procollagen I [de Bruin et al., 2000]. In a later study [de Bruin et al., 2002], procollagen I produced was hydroxylated by an internal mechanism triggered by peptone present in the culture media.\n\nThe aim of this dissertation is to produce transgenic plants expressing the homotrimeric procollagen I and prolyl 4-hydroxylase genes. Since it has been shown that monocot plants prefer different codons than mammals to express the same amino acid, the α(1) collagen type I gene was optimized in order to ensure an adequate usage of the protein code [Horvath et al., 2000;Wu, 2003;van Fleet, 2001;Horvath et al., 2001]. A collagen gene with a GC content of 67% was synthesized, while the natural GC content of the structural genes for the prolyl 4-hydroxylase genes coding for the α subunit (63%) and β subunit (60%) was considered adequate.\n\nThe goal of the work described in this chapter was to express codon optimized procollagen type I in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris in order to verify the correct structure of the synthesized gene.\n\nSpecifically, the following objectives were addressed:\n\n• Synthesis of α1 chain of human collagen type I gene with codons optimized for translation on barley polysomes in the endosperm.\n\n• Development of the vectors needed for protein expression in Pichia pastoris.\n\n• Synthesis of COL1A1 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase in Pichia pastoris\n\nEscherichia coli strain DH5α: Plasmids were cloned in E. coli strain DH5 (α sup E44∆lac U169 (Φ80 lacZ∆M15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1).\n\nYeast strains: Recombinant proteins were expressed in strains GS115 and X-33 of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. GS115 has a mutation in the histidinol dehydrogenase gene (his4 ) and is therefore autotrophic for histidine synthesis [Cregg et al., 1985]. Expression plasmids carrying the HIS4 gene can complement his4 in the host strain, and the transformants can be selected for their ability to grow on histidine-deficient medium. X-33 is a wild type Pichia strain that is useful for selection on Zeocin R and for large-scale growth. Expression plasmids carrying the Sh ble gene confer resistance to Zeocin R to both strains.\n\npUC18 (see Fig. Growth media: E. coli cells were cultivated in liquid LB media or on LB plates according to protocols of Sambrook et al 1989 [Sambrook et al., 1989]. Pichia pastoris was cultivated according to protocols by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).\n\nEnzymes used were from MBI Fermentas (Hannover, MD) if not otherwise stated.\n\nThe gene coding for codon optimized α(1) chain of human collagen type I (NCBI accession number 000088) was codon-optimized in order to match the codon usage for monocot plants with a GC content over 60%. Sixty seven oligonucleotides were synthesized for assembly of the double strand of the collagen 1 codon-optimized gene containing the N-and C-telopeptides and foldon (IDT, Coralville, IA). Oligos 1-33 are orientated in the 5' direction and oligos 34R-67R are orientated in the 3' direction.\n\nEach oligo was 100 base-pairs long with a 50 base-pair overlapping region with the complementary oligo on the opposite strand. Oligos 1 and 64 have five base pairs of the D-hordein signal peptide coding sequence for easy cloning into barley expression vectors (for a detailed list of oligos see Appendix 1).\n\nThe oligos were separated into four groups. Two hundredth of a microliter of each oligo was added to an Eppendorf tube and the volume adjusted up to 50µl with sterile water. For each group two reactions were carried out with 1 and 0.5µl aliquots, respectively, in order to safeguard for optimal concentration. The reactions were incubated in boiling water for 3 min and cooled overnight to allow complete annealing of the oligos. The annealed oligos were ligated with Pfu ligase (Promega, Madison, WI) at 55 • Cfor 1 h, and 1µl of the reaction mixture was used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers described in table 2.1 using program COL2(25) (see Appendix, Table 5.2).\n\nThe PCR product was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (1% gel, 120V, 1h), and a single band of the expected size was cut out, purified with Qiagen gel extraction kit and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nFour fragments were cloned into SmaI digested and dephosphorylated pUC18 according to standard protocol [Sambrook et al., 1989](see Figs. 2.8, 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11). The clones were sent to Amplicon Express (Pullman, WA) for sequencing.\n\nOne mutation was found in clone pUC18 (5'sp-3'2), and it was corrected by splicing by overlapping extension PCR (SOE-PCR) using the protocol described by Horvath, 2000[Horvath et al., 2000].\n\nFor the assembly of the gene, four unique restriction sites were used in order to generate two intermediate vectors. In the first case, pUC18(5'sp-3'2) was digested with HindIII/ EagI, the fragment purified and cloned into pUC18(5'2-3'5) that had been digested with the same enzymes. The plasmid generated was named pUC18(5'sp-3'5)(see Fig. 2.12).\n\npUC18 (5'5-3'8) was digested with HindIII/ NheI and ligated into pUC18 (5'8-3'10) previously digested with the same enzymes to yield plasmid pUC18(5'5-3'10)(see Fig.\n\nA three-way ligation was performed in order to assemble the 3261 base pairs corresponding to the optimized gene. pICZA was used as a donor vector; it was digested with HindIII and EcoRI. On the other hand, two fragments corresponding to half of COL1A1 each were digested from plasmid pUC18 (5'sp-3'5) and pUC18 (5'5-3'10) with HindIII/ Bgl II and EcoRI/ Bgl II respectively. The three pieces were ligated according to manufactures protocol and colonies grown on Zeocin R containing media were isolated and DNA was extracted using Bio-Rad(Hercules, CA) mini-prep kit. Correct orientation of the insert was checked by restriction site analysis to yield plasmid pICZA(COL1A1).\n\nIn order to generate the vectors suitable for expression in Pichia pastoris, it was necessary to eliminate the five base pairs at the beginning of the gene, delete the stop codon at the end, and add EcoRI and NotI restriction sites at the beginning and at the end of the collagen 1 gene. This step was carried out by modifying the beginning and the end of the gene with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nPrimers used were EcoRI/ 3'2 and 5'8/ NotI. Two fragments were amplified from pUC18(5'sp-3'2) and pUC18 (5'8-3'10), cloned into pUC18 and sequenced (Amplicon Express, Pullman, WA). The fragments were then digested with HindIII and EcoRI, respectively, blunted and digested with XbaI and NheI and, after purification, the corresponding segments were placed into pICZA(COL1A1) to generate pICZA(EcoRI-proCOL1A1-NotI). The vector was transformed into DH5α and transformants resistant to Zeocin R were selected. DNA was isolated and digested with EcoRI/NotI and ligated into pICZAαA to generate pICZAαA(EcoRI-proCOL1A1-NotI)(see Fig.\n\nStrain GS115 was used as a parental strain of Pichia pastoris (for a detailed description, see p. 23). Transformation was carried out by the easy comp method (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA),which is based on a protocol described by [Cregg et al., 1985].\n\nThe procedure is carried out by a chemical treatment of the yeast cells with a sorbitol solution that contains ethylene glycol and DMSO in order to make the cells competent. This is followed by the addition of a PEG solution for the transformation itself.\n\npICZAα(EcoRI-proCOLA1-NotI) was linearized with Sal I and transformed into the host strain by the above method. Transformants were selected on YPD(+Zeocin R ) plates.\n\npHIL-S1(α)was linearized with SacI and transformed into GS115 following the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformants were selected by their ability to grow on minimal media plates without histidine.\n\npICZαA(β)was linearized with Sal I and transformed into the host strain GS115.\n\nThe transformants were selected on YPD +Zeocin R plates.\n\nA fourth strain was generated to express both α and β subunits of prolyl 4hydroxylase. GS115 was transformed following the above protocol with pHIL-S1(α)\n\nSacI linearized and pICZαA(β) Sal I linearized in order to generate a strain that produces the α2-β2 tetramer. Transformants were selected on minimal plates without histidine and Zeocin R .\n\nThe cells were cultured according to the manufacturers protocol with modifications as described in Vuorela et al, 1997[Vuorela et al., 1997]. Cells were cultured in 250 ml shaker flasks in a buffered glycerol complex medium, pH 6.0 with 10g/liter of yeast extract and 20g/liter peptone. Expression was induced in complex buffered methanol medium, pH 6.0 and methanol was added every 24 hours to a final concentration of 1%.\n\nAmino acids were added as required. One milliliter aliquots were harvested every 24 h, up to 96 h. Supernatant was concentrated with Centricon YM50 (Millipore, MA), and the cells were resuspended in cold breaking cell buffer and broken by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads, and the lysate then centrifuged for 10 minutes at maximum speed at room temperature. Aliquots of the concentrated liquid culture and soluble fractions were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and the gel stained with Coomassie blue. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane using a semi-dry method. Eighteen volts were applied for 1 hour before blotting the membrane with 2% skim milk. After 1 h of blotting, the membrane was decorated with specific antibodies for collagen (primary antibodie 50kDa pooled rabbit anti-sera, Fibrogen; secondary antirabbit IgG whole molecule peroxidase conjugate, Sigma) and stained for visualization.\n\nIn order to check the integration of the expression plasmid into the Pichia host genome, Zeocin R resistant colonies were screened by PCR based on the protocol by Linder et al [Linder et al., 1996]. Yeast cells were lysed by a combination of lyticase, freezing and heating. A sample of genomic Pichia DNA was taken and the crude lysate subjected to PCR with primers and program shown in the Appendix 5, Table 5.3.\n\nOne hundred microliters of culture medium and cell lysates were used for coating the wells of a Immulon 2HB plate (Dynatech, Alexandria, BC). The pH of the culture medium was increased by addition of 200mM sodium bicarbonate and the medium kept 4 hours at room temperature for binding. The medium was discarded and the wells were washed three times with TBS-Tween and incubated with 200µ of blocking buffer for 2 hours to block unreactive groups. The wells were washed again with TBS-Tween and incubated at 4 • Covernight with primary antibodies diluted 1:500 in 2% skim milk. After washing, secondary antibody was added and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. Then the wells were stained with a solution containing 2ml\n\nTris pH 8.0, 100µl 3% H 2 O 2 and 1ml of 4-chloronaphtol (50mg/ml) in 100ml of water.\n\nPichia derived collagen and bovine gelatin were used as controls at concentrations of 100, 10 and 2 ng/ml.\n\nThe gene was codon optimized in order to match the monocot plant codon usage for amino acids. As stated by Batard and collaborators [Batard et al., 2000], synonymous codons are not equally utilized in all organisms. Within different species, the codon bias becomes stronger for highly expressed genes, probably due to the need to ensure accuracy and efficiency of translation, and to match abundance of the corresponding tRNAs [Chiapello et al., 1998]. A change in codon usage also implies changes in GC content, in secondary structures, in translation initiation and codon context, and in potential splice sites of mRNA. Alone or together, these factors affect the efficiency of translation, often resulting in proteins being poorly expressed or erroneously translated in heterologous organisms [Batard et al., 2000;Koziel et al., 1996]. In order to avoid undesired effects due to expression of a mammalian protein in barley, the gene encoding for collagen 1 was codon optimized according to monocot codon usage [Murray et al., 1989]. The optimized sequence is shown in figures 2.1, 2.2, 2. The gene encoding for the α1 chain of collagen I was synthesized starting with 64 oligos that were assembled as described in Methods. Using intermediate vectors, 3261\n\nbase pairs corresponding to the gene were finally assembled as shown in Fig. 2.17.\n\nThe gene was sequenced at all intermediate steps; one mutation was corrected by\n\nSplicing by Overlap Extension Polymerase Chain Reaction (SOE-PCR) as described by Horvath et al [Horvath et al., 2000]. HindIII that cuts the gene further, specifically in the AOX promoter and terminator.\n\nThe figure is presented in Fig. 2.19. The last expression plasmid is that for the β subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase ( 2.20) that was digested with EcoRI and NotI that cut at the ends of the gene.\n\nPlasmid DNA was isolated and Pichia pastoris strain GS115 was transformed following the EasyComp method (Invitrogen, CA). The genes were inserted into a multiple cloning site downstream of the strong P. pastoris AOX1 alcohol oxidase promoter, to effect transcription induction by methanol. In the case of the P4H α subunit, the gene was ligated with the code for its own signal peptide. On the other hand, COL1A1\n\nand the P4H β subunits genes were ligated in frame with the pre-pro α-mating factor sequence of S. cerevisiae to facilitate secretion of the peptides. The picZαA plasmid confers resistance to Zeocin R , whereas, pHIL-S1 will allow the yeast strain to grow on minimal medium. Both plasmids lack a yeast origin of replication; therefore, Zeocin R resistant and His+ colonies generated after transformation are attributable to integration of the vector(s) into the yeast genome. A summary of the vectors generated, the transformed strains and the polypeptide encoded is presented in table 2.2. All transformed colonies used for protein expression analysis were scored for their phenotype, meaning that the integration of the plasmid was at the 5' region of the AOX1 gene.\n\nAs a result, the transformants grow normally with methanol as the sole carbon source.\n\nAdditionally, colonies were screened by direct PCR to confirm the integration of the plasmid into the yeast genome (Fig. 2.21, 2.22 and 2.23).\n\nPichia pastoris strain GS115 used as host strain; it is auxotroph for histidine and lacks the Sh Ble gene that confers resistance to Zeocin R .\n\nIn order to evaluate the correct function of the codon modified collagen type I gene, the gene was inserted into Pichia pastoris expression vector pICZAαA, and the host strain GS115 then transformed to generate GS115(pICZAαA(EcoRI-proCOL1A1-NotI)). The strain was methanol-induced, and cells and supernatant were collected after 96 hours. Cells were broken with glass beads in an appropriate phosphate buffer, and the supernatant was concentrated using YM50. Both supernatant and cell lysate were analyzed without pepsin treatment by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining or with Western blots using specific antibodies against the collagen type I domain for visualization (Fibrogen, San Francisco, CA)\n\nA band corresponding to the size of homotrimeric procollagen I was observed on the SDS-PAGE gel upon Coomassie staining (Fig. 2.24) from the cell lysate and concentrated culture media. The protein band was confirmed to be procollagen by reacting in a Western blot with antibodies specific for an unhydroxylated procollagen1 domain (Fig. 2.25). The size of the protein was about 180 kDa, which is in the range of non hydroxylated homotrimer procollagen I according to Myllyharju and collabora-tors [Myllyharju et al., 1997], who expressed collagen type I with bacillovirus in High Five insect cells. Vuorela at al [Vuorela et al., 1997] obtained homotrimeric collagen I in Pichia pastoris, with the same apparent molecular size as in the present study. In a recent report, the same group, [Pakkanen et al., 2003], successfully expressed procollagen I plus foldon in Pichia pastoris and the apparent size was also about 180kDa\n\n. The level of expression, nevertheless, was very low, requiring concentration of the supernatant with Centricon filters in order to visualize the protein by Coomassie staining in SDS-PAGE gels or as Western blots. This could have been due to either the high molecular weight or to inefficient transport through the yeast cell wall. Previous analysis [Myllyharju et al., 2000;Nokelainen et al., 2001], in experiments with collagen I and III concluded that the protein accumulates inside the endoplasmic reticulum of the yeast cell [Keizer-Gunnink et al., 2000]. Surprisingly, no significant collagen could be detected in our study inside the yeast cell. One possible explanation could be that the collagen was degraded inside the cell or that the protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) added to the breaking buffer did not act as expected. A second explanation for the low level of expression could be an insufficient amount of O 2 provided in the shaker flask during induction of protein production [Myllyharju et al., 2000]. A third factor that could determine the level of expression was the use of the α mating factor signal peptide, which also has given low yield in a previous study [Vuorela et al., 1997]. Finally it is possible that the collagen molecule aggregates with endogenous proteins, giving a higher apparent molecular size and a non-specific smear with the Western blot Expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase β subunit was achieved by cultivating the strain in buffered media. After 72 hours, cells were broken as described above and the supernatant was concentrated with Centricon YM30. Both supernatant and the soluble fraction from the cell lysate were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomasie staining of the gel. A 55kDa protein band corresponding to the apparent molecular size was visualized in the Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2.26). The expression of this protein is in agreement with the results of Vuorela et al [Vuorela et al., 1997] who stated also that expression of PDI with the yeast prepro α-mating factor sequence increased the yield of β subunit of P4H secreted into the medium compared to the construct with its own signal peptide or that with the Pichia pastoris acid phosphatase 1 signal sequence.\n\nIn the case of the expression of α subunit of P4H, no detectable level of expression was achieved by induction of the yeast cell. On the other hand, when the strain containing both genes for the expression α2β2 tetramer was induced, only a band corresponding to β subunit was visualized on the gel (see Fig. 2.27). This can be explained by instability of the tetramer in the absence of procollagen molecules; consequently, the α subunit is degraded and only the β subunit remains [Vuorela et al., 1997].   for (α1) chain of collagen type I. The gene was assembled starting from oligonucleotides that were ligated, amplified by PCR and cloned into intermediate vectors to yield the 3262 base pairs corresponding to the gene.

Lane 1, colony digested with EcoRI and  collagen I in Pichia pastoris. 1.5 ml of culture medium was concentrated to 70µl; 40µl were boiled for 3 minutes with 6x loading buffer and then 20 µl were loaded into each well of a 10% SDS gel. 100volt were applied for 2 hours and the gel was then stained overnight with Coomassie blue.

One hundred volt were applied for 2 h and the gel was then stained overnight with Coomassie blue. Lane 1, marker; lanes 4 and 5 concentrated culture medium.\n\nSeveral expression systems have been developed to express heterologous proteins.\n\nAmong them, mammalian and plant systems seem to be the most suitable to produce recombinant human proteins with the correct structure.\n\nSynthesis of recombinant collagen presents several challenges because of the number of post-translational modifications, requiring eight different enzymes, some of them unique to collagens; all of them are needed to achieve a fully folded, triple helical conformation. Procollagen produced in insect cells and yeast must be treated with pepsin [Bulleid et al., 2000], a process that could damage the telopeptides [Bulleid et al., 2000] and, as a consequence, pepsin-extracted collagen might not form fibrils [Leibovich and Weiss, 1970;Bulleid et al., 2000]. However, these systems provide the basic knowledge needed to develop new expression systems that can successfully process collagen.\n\nMammalian cell lines have been engineered to produce recombinant collagen, resulting in procollagen secreted into the culture medium [Fichard et al., 1997]. In this experi-ment, human embryonic kidney cells (293-EBNA) were transfected with the full-length human α1 chain of collagen V using an episomal vector. High yields (15 mg/ml) of recombinant collagen were secreted into the culture medium. In the presence of ascorbate, the α1(V) collagen was correctly folded into a stable triple helix as demonstrated by electron microscopy and pepsin treatment. Circular dichroism data confirmed the triple-helix conformation and indicated a melting temperature of 37.5 • Cfor the recombinant homotrimer. The major secreted form was a 250-kDa polypeptide (a1FL).\n\nThe mammary gland is a promising expression system, and several proteins have already been expressed satisfactorily from different species including mice [Prunkard et al., 1996], rabbit [Stromqvist et al., 1997] and pig [Paleyanda et al., 1997]. The system uses mammary-gland-specific promoters that drive the expression of foreign proteins in milk. In the case of collagen, two reports have been published describing the use of transgenic mice for collagen production. The first one [John et al., 1999] involved secretion of a truncated ((α)1)3 molecule using the αS1-casein promoter. The transgenic mouse lines were generated to also express prolyl 4-hydroxylase, but the melting temperature was lower than bovine-extracted collagen, possibly because the chain had a lower percentage of hydroxyproline residues than the full-length chain.\n\nIn the second report [Toman et al., 1999], transgenic mice were generated containing the α S1-casein mammary-gland-specific promoter operatively linked to 37kb of the human α1(I) procollagen structural gene and 3' flanking region. The frequency of transgenic lines established was 12%. High levels of soluble triple helical homotrimeric [(α1)3] type I procollagen were detected (up to 8 mg/ml) exclusively in the milk of six out of nine lines of lactating transgenic mice. The transgene-derived human procollagen chains underwent efficient assembly into a triple helical structure. Although proline or lysine hydroxylation is not common for milk proteins, procollagen was detected with these post-translational modifications. The procollagen was stable in milk, and minimal degradation was observed.\n\nBoth results showed that the mammary gland is capable of expressing a large procollagen gene construct, efficiently assemble the individual polypeptide chains into a stable triple helix, and secrete the intact molecule into the milk.\n\nTransgenic silkworms are able to produce collagenous domains and secrete them into the cocoons [Tomita et al., 2003]. A mini-chain encoding for type III collagen was used as transgene, under the control of a fibroin light chain promoter and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding region as a selectable marker. The cDNA was inserted between the fibroin L-chain gene 5'-flanking and 3'-flanking sequences. The expression units were inserted into a vector containing the gene for red fluorescent protein. Pre-blastoderm embryos were injected with the constructs and allowed to develop at 25 • C. The construct was expressed, but due to lack of hydroxylation, the protein was not assembled in the silk gland.\n\nRuggeiro and collaborators, [Ruggiero et al., 2000], using tobacco as an expression system, obtained primary transformants from different constructs encoding human proα1(I) chain. As expected, the plants produced homotrimer molecules, but due to the specificity of the plant prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the plant enzyme cannot ensure the prolyl-hydroxylation of the collagenous tripeptide X-Pro-Gly [Tanaka et al., 1981]. On the other hand, since plants contain PDI, that corresponds to the beta subunit of P4H, it might act as a chaperon during chain assembly [Ruggiero et al., 2000], aiding in the formation of homotrimers. In a different report [Perret et al., 2001], demonstrated that the amount of proline-hydroxyproline is a limiting factor in unhydroxylated procollagen assembly.\n\nIn a later study, Merle and collaborators ([Merle et al., 2002]), produced hydroxylated homotrimer collagen I as a result of Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation of intact tobacco leaves. Plants expressing collagen, PDI and α subunit were analyzed and the results shown conclusively that the system produced thermally stable triple helical homotrimeric collagen I. The level of hydroxyproline formation was identical to the level obtained with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but in a lower concentration compared to that achieved with Pichia pastoris.\n\nBarley can produce and store recombinant proteins in the endosperm up to 1g per kilo of grain [Horvath et al., 2000]. Several proteins have been successfully expressed in the barley endosperm including lysozyme, lactoferrin, human serum albumin and an engineered thermostable beta-glucanase using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of immature zygotic embryos [Horvath et al., 2000;Stahl et al., 2002].\n\nFor my study, transcription of the collagen gene was carried out with the hordein D-promoter and the mRNA translated by the polysomes of the endoplasmic reticulum of the endosperm of the barley grain. Endosperm specific expression of proteins driven by the hordein promoter are stably inherited in the T1, T2 and following generations, and recombinant proteins segregate in a Mendelian fashion [Cho et al., 2002;Horvath et al., 2000].\n\nThe genes coding for collagen and both subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase were fused to the nucleotide sequence of the hordein 3 (hor-3) signal peptide. Hor3 signal peptide contains 21 amino acids that direct the nascent polypeptide chains to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where the signal peptide is cleaved off during or immediately after translocation. From there the proteins are delivered via the Golgi apparatus into the storage vacuoles of the endosperm [Horvath et al., 2000]. Deposition of the proteins in the storage protein bodies protect them from programmed cell death during the maturation phase of the grain.\n\nThe single-cassette vector also has the bar gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter and nos terminator for selection of positive transformants on bialaphos-containing medium. The bar gene codes for the enzyme phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT), which inactivates the toxicity of L-phosphinothricin (L-PPT). This later compound inhibits the enzyme glutamine synthetase, an inhibition that results in a high accumulation of ammonium. This ammonium interferes with the electron transport in chloroplasts and mitochondria, causing cell death. In transformed plants, PAT detoxifies L-PPT by acetylation and, as a result, calli carrying the bar gene will survive and regenerate into green plants [De Block et al., 1995].\n\nThe main goal of the work reported in this chapter is to provide the basis for the production of transgenic barley plants expressing the genes needed for hydroxylated collagen. In order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to develop the vectors and transform immature zygotic embryos of barley.\n\nSpecifically, the following objectives were addressed:\n\n• Develop the vectors needed for the Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation of barley\n\n• Transformation of immature embryos\n\n• Production of barley plants containing the genes for the production of hydroxylated homotrimeric procollagen I.\n\nNcoI. Five microliters of the ligation mixture were used to transform DH5α-competent cells, and positive colonies were plated out on LB ampicillin plates. Transformants were confirmed by PCR and restriction digests.\n\nTo add the NOS terminator at the end, the plasmids pHordSpNos and RS366(COL1A1)\n\nwere digested with Hind III and SacI, and then ligated to generate plasmid pHorSp(COL1A1)Nos (Fig. 3.6).\n\nPlasmid pJH260 is a single cassette vector that contains the bar gene used for selection against bialaphos\n\nThe fragment encoding hordein-D promoter-signal peptide-COL1A1-nos terminator sequence was digested from plasmid pHorSp(COL1A1)Nos with EcoRI, blunted and digested with Hind III, and cloned into pJH260 previously SpeI-blunted and Hind IIIdigested to yield pCO200 (see Fig. 3.8). DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation, and then kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected and analyzed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Minipreps were prepared with the BioRad miniprep kit.\n\nA similar procedure was followed to generate the intermediate vectors containing the α and β subunits for prolyl 4-hydroxylase. For the α subunit, a fragment encoding the hordein D-promoter was amplified from plasmid RS366 using primers 5'NcoI-prom and 3'sp-alpha. Using program COL2(25) (Appendix, Table 5.2), 8 overlapping base pairs were added to the α subunit amplified from plasmid 002 (Fibrogen, San Francisco, CA) using primers 5'sp-alpha and 3'alpha. Both fragments were spliced together with SOE-PCR as previously described. The fragment was cloned into pUC18 previously digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated, and then sequenced. No errors were found and the plasmid pUC18(NcoI-alpha) was digested with SpeI, blunted and digested again with NcoI. The resulting fragment was cloned into RS366 digested with EcoRI, blunted and digested with NcoI. This intermediate vector (RS366alpha) was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into pHorspnos digested with the same enzymes to yield plasmid pHorspαnos (Fig. 3.4).\n\nA similar protocol was followed for the generation of the intermediate plasmid pHorspβnos. The amplification of the fragment corresponding to part of the hordein promoter was done using primers 5'NcoI-prom and 3'sp-beta taking as a template plasmid RS366. The gene coding for the β subunit was amplified from plasmid 003 (Fibrogen, San Francisco, CA) using primers 5'sp-beta and 3'beta. Both fragments were spliced together, cloned into pUC18 and sequenced as described. The resulting plasmid [pUC18(NcoI-beta)] was digested as previously described for pUC18(NcoIalpha) to yield plasmids RS366beta and pHorspβnos (Fig. 3.5).\n\npHorspαnos and pHorspβnos were treated with Hind III/EcoRI adaptor (Easyclones systems) and ligated into pCO200 to yield pCO210 and pCO220, respectively, with protocol as described by the manufacturer (Figs. 3.9 and 3.10). Colonies were selected for kanamycin resistance.\n\nTo generate a plasmid containing COL1A1 and α and β subunits of prolyl 4hydroxylases, pCO200 was digested with Hind III and dephosphorylated. Concurrently, plasmids pHorspαnos and pHorspβnos were Hind III and EcoRI digested, and a three way ligation was done to produce plasmid pCO250 (Fig. 3.11).\n\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL-1 was electroporated at 1.25kv, 25F and 200Ω on the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; kanamycin resistant colonies were then selected, and transformation was confirmed by restriction site analysis.\n\nBarley transformation was done as described in Horvath et al [Horvath et al., 2000], with small modifications. Time-line of transformation is shown in Table 3.1.\n\nEmbryo axes were removed by cutting. Three different experiments were conducted (Table 3.2). Co-cultivation with the corresponding Agrobacterium strain was done for 40 minutes, and the embryos were then transferred to CIM(0) plates and maintained at 24 • Cfor 48 hours before transferring into CIM(4) media.\n\nAt the moment that the putative transformants are transferred to soil from root generating media, a piece of leaf was cut from each plant and put into an Eppendorf tube.\n\nThe tissue was frozen by immersion into liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 • C. DNA from each putative transformant was then isolated as follows. To each Eppendorf tube containing leaf tissue, 400µl of extraction buffer composed of 200mM Tris-HCl ,pH 8, 250mM NaCl, 25mM EDTA and 0.5%SDS was added and the tissue was homogenized with a grinder. To the homogenized tissue, 400µl of chloroform was added, vortexed and spun at maximum speed for 10 minutes. Three hundred microliters of the supernatant were transferred to a clean tube, and the DNA was precipitated by addition of 300µl of isopropanol and then incubating the tubes at room temperature for 1 h.\n\nSamples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at maximum speed and the resulting pellet was washed twice with 75%EtOH, dried and resuspended in 50µl of sterile water.\n\nReactions were carried out to screen for the presence of the gene (Table 3.2).\n\nThe diagnostic samples were amplified from the template with a 25µl mixture that contained 1µl of plant DNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 2mM dNTPs, Pfu buffer and Pfu polymerase as suggested by the manufacturer. PCR parameters were the same as described in table 5.2.\n\nFour single cassette vectors were made available for barley transformation. Each gene was under the control of the hordein D-promoter that effects transcription of the gene in the endosperm (see Fig. 3.7). Translation of the protein precursor with its signal peptide leads to transfer into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and from there the mature protein is transferred into the storage vacuoles [Cameron-Mills et al., 1978;Cameron-Mills and von Wettstein, 1980]. Plasmid pCO200 has the gene coding for the α1 chain of collagen I flanked by the hordein D-promoter plus signal peptide sequence and nos terminator. Plasmids pCO210 and pCO220 were generated from plasmid pCO200 and also have the gene coding for α and β subunits of pro-lyl 4-hydroxylase respectively. The restriction analysis of plasmids pCO200, pCO210, pCO220 can be seen in figure 3.12 after digestion with NotI and HindIII. The 4.2kb fragment correspond to COL1A1 flanked by hordein promoter and nos terminator; the 3.0kb fragment corresponds to the plasmid fragment from pJH260. The 2.4kb and 2.3kb fragments in lanes 3 and 4 correspond to α and β subunits of prolyl 4hydroxylase flanked also by hordein promoter and nos terminator, respectively. For the production of hydroxylated homotrimeric collagen I, a plasmid was constructed containing the three genes (α1 chain, α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase), each flanked by its own hordein D-promoter plus signal peptide sequence and nos terminator. Restriction analysis conducted to the plasmid are conclusive about integration and correct orientation of the fragments corresponding to the α and β subunits of P4H.\n\nThe analysis can be seen in Fig. 3.13. Lane 1 shows the plasmid digested with HindIII, that corresponds to α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Lane 2 corresponds to the plasmid digested with EcoRI that shows evidence of the correct cut of the plasmid.\n\nIn lane 3 it can be seen the plasmid digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The fragments corresponding to COL1A1 and the α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase are recognizable as bands with a size of 4.1, 2.4 and 2.3kb. The bands with a size of 1.3 and 1.4kb corresponds to fragments of the plasmid pJH260. This plasmid was also used for transformation of immature zygotic embryos.\n\nIn one experiment, 95 embryos were co-cultivated with plasmid pCO200. In subsequent transformation experiments, 600 embryos were co-cultivated with a mixture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing plasmid pCO210 or pCO220. It was expected that stable transgenic plants would be generated that expressed the three genes from pCO210 and pCO220 in single primary transformed scutellum cells. Regeneration of transgenic plants from such cells would then provide transformants producing the protein from all three genes. Such simultaneous expression from two plasmids has been demonstrated by Merle and collaborators [Merle et al., 2002]. Transformations are also being carried out with plasmid pCO250; these will lead to transgenic plants expressing the three genes needed for the production of hydroxylated homotrimeric collagen type I. Embryos were selected on callus-induction medium containing bialaphos for selection of positive transformants [De Block et al., 1995]. Timentin was used to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium on the plate. Timentin is composed of a mixture (15:1) of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid. Since Agrobacterium tumefaciens has β-lactamase activity, clavulanic acid acts as a competitive inhibitor of β-lactamase, resulting in the death of bacteria due to cell wall lysis by ticarcillin action [Nauerby et al., 1997].\n\nAt this point, three plants transformed with pCO200 and three plants transformed with a mixture of pCO210 and pCO220 were tested with specific primers with negative results. This is not surprising because of the level of transformation for barley cultivar Golden Promise is often not more than 4% [Tingay et al., 1997].\n\nIt is expected that among the additional plants that are being generated, positive transformants will be found.

They can be grown, stored, processed and distributed with a relatively low level of technology. Moreover, protein secretion and folding in plants is similar to animals, which make them suitable for production of mammalian proteins.\n\nBased on these premises, the long term goal of this study is to produce recombinant collagen type I in the endosperm of barley grains, thereby generating an alternative to animal-derived collagen and minimizing possible immune responses to bone-extracted collagen. To achieve this goal, the gene was codon-optimized, assembled and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. In addition, barley transformants were obtained by transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. At this time, transformants are being generated, and further analysis is needed to characterize the protein produced. It is known that hydroxylation is needed for the assembly of correctly folded and thermally stable collagen [Bruckner and Prockop, 1981;Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Fessler and Fessler, 1978]. The question therefore is critical if barley is able to hydroxylate the protein, and store it in protein bodies of the endosperm. Barley can synthesize up to 1g of recombinant protein per kilo of grain and store it in active form in the protein bodies of the endosperm [Horvath et al., 2000]. In this study, the genes coding for alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase were co-transformed into immature zygotic embryos. It is expected that the genes will be transferred with two plasmids delivered by two different strains of Agrobacterium into the same cell as previously described [Merle et al., 2002]. This will be a condition for the synthesis of hydroxylated and thermally stable homotrimeric collagen chains. Since the developing endosperm of barley contains PDI in its endoplasmic reticulum [Mogelsvag and Simpson, 1998] in the form of a homomeric dimer, it will be interesting to evaluate if the endogenous PDI can substitute for the β subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the transformants that only express the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase together with the gene encoding the α1 chain of type I collagen. This is of special interest since the prolyl 4-hydroxylase in tobacco cannot substitute for the human prolyl 4-hydroxylase [Perret et al., 2001].\n\nThe expression of heterotrimeric collagen is also a point that needs to be consderated. Type I collagen is composed of two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains. Expression of heterotrimeric collagen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Toman et al., 2000] was obtained using four genes. Thus, the next step for us would be to produce a plant with the four genes for production of collagen type I. These transformants can be made by at least three different approaches. The first one would be to make a new line that will have the COL2A1 gene and cross it with the existing transformants. This method is an effective method for the assembly of complex proteins in plants [Hiatt et al., 1989;Ma et al., 1995]. An alternative method is to adapt the microspore transformation system recently developed for wheat [Liu, 2004] starting with a parental strain now produced.\n\nThe main advantage of this method over use of immature embryos is the direct generation of transgenic homozygous doubled haploid lines in 6 months. This has provided the possibility for a faster production of transgenic cereals. These two methods have the challenge that the selection of the transformants has to be done with a different selectable marker.\n\nOne possible alternative to bialaphos selection is the use of the phosphomannose isomerase gene, pmi (manA from Escherichia coli ), as a selectable marker. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) converts mannose-6-phosphate, an unmetabolizable carbon source for most plant cells, into fructose-6-phosphate, a carbohydrate source that can be used by plants. Plants expressing transgenic pmi are able to metabolize mannose as a carbon source. This promotes growth of transgenic tissues on media containing mannose, while non-transformed calli or plants either stop growing or die due to starvation [Wright et al., 2001;Hansen and Wright, 1999]. Moreover, the number of escapes produced using this selection method decreases considerably, by generating two to three fold more transformants than obtained with bar gene as the selectable marker [Wright et al., 2001]. Successful results have been reported on wheat, corn [Wright et al., 2001] and rice [Datta et al., 2003].\n\nThe biosynthesis of collagen requires lysyl hydroxylase, also named procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase (PLOD). Lysyl hydroxylase is an important posttranslational modifying enzyme in collagen biosynthesis [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998]. This enzyme hydroxylates specific lysine residues in the collagen molecule to form hydroxylysines that have two important functions: attachment sites for galactose and glucosylgalactose and precursors for the cross-linking process that gives collagen its tensile strength [Kivirikko and Pihlajaniemi, 1998;Notbohm et al., 1999;Kivirikko et al., 1990]. The number of hydroxylated lysyl residues and glycosylated hydroxylysine residues varies not only among different collagen types but also within the same collagen type in different tissues and under different physiological conditions.\n\nEmbryonic collagens, for instance, are more extensively modified than adult collagens [Prockop and Kivirikko, 1995].\n\nThe importance of lysyl hydroxylase was demonstrated by in vitro fibril formation of collagen type II, using a bacilovirus system. Fully processed fibrils were formed after infection with the vector coding for lysil hydroxylase [Notbohm et al., 1999]. Three isoforms (LH1, LH2, LH3) have been characterized from human and mouse. [Kivirikko et al., 1990][Valtavaara andan R. Myllyla, 1998]. In later studies, LH3 was shown to be a multifunctional protein possessing both collagen galactosyl transferase and collagen glucosyltransferase activity [Wang et al., 2002] even though the levels of the glycosyltransferase activities may not have been biologically significant [Rautavuoma et al., 2002].\n\nThe results presented here are preliminary and were designed to evaluate the po-tential of using barley as a producer of recombinant collagen. The developing transformants have to be characterized and their usefulness evaluated. It is then of high priority to include the gene that codes for lysyl hydroxylase in the production of transgenic 5.3 Primers\n\nFigure 5.3: Alignment of codon-optimized COL1A1.
