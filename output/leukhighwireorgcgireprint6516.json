    "abstract": "Chemokines can act as signal lamps for trafficking of lymphocytes at the important crossing points of lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid progenitors at different differentiation stages are differentially localized in primary lymphoid tissues and have differential responsiveness to thymic or bone marrow chemokines: SDF-1, CK␤-11/MIP-3␤/ ELC, SLC/6Ckine/Exodus2, MIP-1␤, and TECK. Naive T cells and B cells circulate to secondary lymphoid tissues for possible activation. Chemokines, SDF-1, SLC/6Ckine/Exodus2, CK␤-11/MIP-3␤/ELC, BLC/BCA-1, and DC-CK1/PARC, are expressed in the specialized microenvironments of secondary lymphoid tissues and regulate the migration of naive lymphocytes. Effector lymphocytes express a different set of chemokine receptors from naive lymphocytes. T helper (Th) 0 and 1 cells predominantly express CXCR3 and CCR5, whereas Th2 cells express CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8, which, with other factors such as expression patterns of adhesion molecules, likely determine the tissuespecific infiltration of effector lymphocytes.",
    "full_text": "Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are small secretory or membrane-bound proteins with molecular masses of 6-14 kDa [1][2][3][4]. The primary function of chemokines is chemoattraction of leukocytes or regulation of leukocyte trafficking. Other functions of chemokines include regulation of HIV infection [5,6], regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) proliferation and mobilization of HPC [7,8], regulation of angiogenesis [9], fetal development [10][11][12], and activation of leukocytes [13]. The chemokine family has rapidly grown to the point that there are now more than 50 human members identified (see Table 1 for chemokine abbreviations; see Table 2 for receptor usage). Chemokines have been described as pro-inflammatory cytokines because expression of many chemokines are inducible in inflammatory conditions and they attract leukocytes mediating inflammatory reactions. However, it has been recently observed that some chemokines perform other basic functions in immune systems, which are not directly related to the inflammatory functions. These functions include regulation of trafficking of immature blood cells and naive lymphocytes. Chemokines appear to influence the trafficking of lymphocytes at various stages of maturation from primary to secondary and then tertiary lymphoid tissues. The important roles of leukocyte interactions with vascular endothelium in the trafficking of lymphocytes, through discrete steps involving selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling and subsequent tight adhesion mediated by members of the integrin and immunoglobulin families of adhesion molecules has been well appreciated [14][15][16][17]. Combined actions of the adhesion molecules and chemokines largely determine the migratory behavior of lymphocytes. In this article, we review the roles of chemokines in the chemotaxis and trafficking of immature, mature, and effector lymphocytes.\n\nProgenitors of lymphocytes initiate T lymphopoiesis mainly in thymus and B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. Lymphocyte progenitors colonize specific sites of primary lymphoid tissues for proliferation and development into mature naive lymphocytes. T cells, B cells, NK cells, and lymphoid dendritic cells are believed to develop from common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) in bone marrow (BM), which have a phenotype of Lin Ϫ , IL-7R ϩ , Thy-1 Ϫ , Sca-1 lo , c-kit lo in the murine system [18]. CLP undergo a number of differentiation stages to become mature naive T cells. Trafficking of BM HPC, including the CLP, may be regulated by a CXC chemokine, SDF-1. SDF-1 has a broad-spectrum chemotactic activity for BM CD34 ϩ HPC [19,20]. Thymocytes at different developmental stages are differentially localized in thymus. Immature CD3 Ϫ CD4 Ϫ CD8 Ϫ triplenegative (TN) thymocytes are found in the outer cortex of thymus, whereas more mature CD4 ϩ CD8 ϩ double-positive (DP) thymocytes reside in the remainder of the cortex. Mature CD4 ϩ or CD8 ϩ single-positive (SP) thymocytes are found in the medulla, where they migrate to the secondary lymphoid tissues through peripheral blood (PB) or lymphatic vessels [21][22][23].\n\nThymocyte migration in thymus may not be random, but rather this may be a regulated process. Chemokines are good candidates to regulate the ordered localization and migration of T cell progenitors. Thymus expresses a number of chemokines including MDC/STCP-1 [24,25], TECK [26], TARC [27], SDF-1 [28], LARC/MIP-3␣/Exodus [29][30][31], murine thymusderived chemotactic agent 4 (TCA4) [32], and CK␤-11/MIP-3␤/ ELC [31,33] at high levels (Table 3). TECK is expressed by thymic dendritic cells but not by bone marrow dendritic cells [26]. TECK has chemotactic activity on thymocytes, activated macrophages, and dendritic cells [26]. It is possible that TECK, expressed by thymic medullar dendritic cells, attracts thymocytes and macrophages for co-localization of dendritic cells with thymocytes and macrophages. Thymic dendritic cells are implicated in the negative selection of thymocytes, which eliminates self-antigen reactive thymocytes [34]. Thymic macrophages attracted to TECK have the potential to remove dead thymocytes by scavenging them. Although the chemotactic specificity of TECK for thymocyte subsets is not known, the expression of TECK in thymic medulla suggests that it may attract DP thymocytes.\n\nTwo thymus-expressed chemokines, SDF-1, a CXC chemokine, and CK␤-11, a CC chemokine, were comparatively studied in detail in chemotaxis of thymocyte subsets [35]. SDF-1 and CK␤-11 differentially attracted DN thymocytes, DP thymocytes, CD4 ϩ SP, and CD8 ϩ SP thymocytes. When the two chemokines were directly compared to each other, SDF-1 was a stronger chemoattractant for DN and DP thymocytes than CK␤-11, whereas CK␤-11 was a more efficacious chemoattractant for SP thymocytes than SDF-1. Receptor (CXCR4 for SDF-1; CCR7 for CK␤-11) expression in the four thymocyte subsets correlates with the chemotactic preference of SDF-1 and CK␤-11. Cross-desensitization experiments between SDF-1and CK␤-11-dependent chemotaxis demonstrated that SDF-1, a relatively minor chemoattractant for SP thymocytes, cannot desensitize the chemotactic activity of CK␤-11 on SP thymocytes. Similarly, CK␤-11, a weak chemoattractant for DN and DP thymocytes, cannot desensitize the chemotactic activity of SDF-1 on DN and DP thymocytes, suggesting that the two chemokines have different target specificity. The chemotactic activity of SDF-1 for the very immature TN thymocyte subsets was examined [35]. SDF-1 efficaciously attracted all four subsets of TN thymocytes: CD25 Ϫ CD44 ϩ , CD25 ϩ CD44 ϩ , CD25 ϩ CD44 Ϫ , and CD25 Ϫ CD44 Ϫ subsets. CD69 ϩ CD4 ϩ CD8 ϩ DP thymocytes are believed to be DP thymocytes undergoing thymic selection processes. It is interesting to note that chemotactic responsiveness of CD69 ϩ DP cells to SDF-1 and TABLE 3. Expression of Lymphocyte Chemoattractants in Lymphoid Tissues BM SDF-1, CK␤-11 a Thymus STCP-1, TECK, TARC, SDF-1, LARC, CK␤-11, SLC Lymph nodes LARC, STCP-1, SLC, CK␤-11 Spleen LARC, STCP-1, SDF-1, SLC, CK␤-11, HCC-1 Small intestines LARC, TECK, CK␤-11, HCC-1\n\na Expression of CK␤-11 in BM is inducible, but not constitutive, in response to IFN-␥, TNF-␣, or bacterial lipopolysaccharides [110]. CK␤-11 is greater than that of CD69 Ϫ DP thymocytes (thymocytes before thymic selection), suggesting that the thymic selection processes modulate the chemotactic responsiveness of thymocytes. It appears that T cells in different organs have differential chemotactic responsiveness. The chemotactic responsiveness of splenic CD4 ϩ T cells to SDF-1 and CK␤-11 was greater than that of thymic CD4 ϩ T cells [35]. Thus, developing T cells at different maturation stages or organs appear to modulate their chemotactic responsiveness to chemokines, which may be a regulation mechanism for T cell trafficking during early T cell development. SLC/6Ckine/ Exodus2, another ligand sharing the CCR7 receptor with CK␤-11, also has a preferential chemotactic specificity for SP thymocytes subsets [C. H. Kim and H. E. Broxmeyer, unpublished results].\n\nMIP-1␤ attracts CD4 ϩ SP, CD8 ϩ SP, and DP thymocyte subsets, but not the DN subset [36]. MIP-1␤ induces mobilization of intracellular calcium, phosphorylation of protein tyrosine, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in thymocytes [36]. Only DP and CD8 ϩ SP subsets, but not DN and CD4 ϩ SP subsets, expressed CCR5, a major receptor for MIP-1␤, suggesting that other chemokine receptors such as CCR8, a recently identified MIP-1␤ receptor, may also be involved in the thymocyte chemotaxis to MIP-1␤ [36]. Other thymus-expressed chemokines, TARC, LARC, MDC/STCP-1, and murine TCA4, attract mature leukocytes: TARC attracts T cell lines [27]; LARC attracts resting lymphocytes [30]; MDC/STCP-1 attracts activated T cells, monocytederived dendritic cells, monocytes, and NK cells [24,25]; TCA4 attracts mature T cells and cultured mesangial cells [32]. Recirculation of mature T cells to thymus was suggested to be a negative regulation mechanism of T lymphopoiesis [37,38]. Thus, these thymus-expressed chemoattractants for mature T cells may have a role in T lymphopoiesis by regulating the trafficking of mature T cells into thymus.\n\nCLP undergo a number of differentiation stages to make mature B cells in the BM [39][40][41][42]. B cell progenitors stay in the BM for proliferation and development until they differentiate into mature naive B cells. It is speculated that some regulatory factors in BM attract B cell progenitors to the BM microenvironment, where a number of B cell growth factors, such as interleukin-7 (IL-7), SDF-1/pre-B cell growth stimulatory factor (PBSF), pre-B cell costimulatory factor (BST)-1, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), are present to support B lymphopoiesis [43]. SDF-1 may be a possible regulatory factor for trafficking of BM B cell progenitors. SDF-1 has chemotactic activity for diverse B cell progenitor cell lines and primary B cell progenitors [44]. The chemotactic responsiveness of B cell progenitors appears to be related to the differentiation stages of B cells. Chemotactic responsiveness of the progenitor B cell lines to SDF-1 was higher in immature B cell lines, and was almost not detected in mature B cell lines [44]. It is not clear whether this preferential chemotactic activity of SDF-1 for immature B cells over mature B cells is a real phenomenon or restricted phenomenon to some murine B cell progenitor cell lines. Human B cell progenitors are also chemotactically responsive to SDF-1 [C. H. Kim and H. E. Broxmeyer, unpublished results]. However, human B cells are different from the murine B cell lines in that even mature B cells are highly responsive to SDF-1 [45]. SDF-1 may attract B cell progenitors to BM stromal cells, where SDF-1 is produced [46].\n\nMost chemokines induce directional migration (chemotaxis) but not random migration (chemokinesis). Cells attracted to chemokines are quickly desensitized, and desensitized cells are not responsive to the same chemokine (homologous desensitization) and may not be responsive to some other chemokines (heterologous desensitization) [20,47]. Thus SDF-1 might also act as an inhibitory factor that deters emigration of premature B cells out of BM. Mice deficient in SDF-1 or its receptor CXCR4 are defective in B lymphopoiesis in fetal liver and BM [10][11][12]. This abnormal B lymphopoiesis in these mice may be due to either absence of the chemotactic activity or loss of B cell growth activity of SDF-1. BM CD34\n\nϩ CD19 ϩ cells represent early pro/pre B-I progenitors. They mature into CD19 ϩ pre-B-II progenitors and lose expression of CD34. Immature B cells express CD19 and surface IgM, and mature B cells express CD19, IgM, and IgD. Two CC chemokines, CK␤-11 and SLC have been identified as chemoattractants for late-stage human CD34 Ϫ CD19 ϩ IgM Ϫ B cell progenitors and immature/mature CD19 ϩ IgM ϩ B cells, but not early CD34 ϩ CD19 ϩ B cell progenitors [C. H. Kim and H. E. Broxmeyer, unpublished results]. Thus the chemotactic activity of CK␤-11 and SLC for B cell progenitors is more restricted than that of SDF-1, since SDF-1 attracts all stages of B cell progenitors [C. H. Kim and H. E. Broxmeyer, unpublished results].\n\nNaive lymphocytes leave primary lymphoid tissues and migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as peripheral lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer's patches [17]. However, it needs to be mentioned that whether or not naive lymphocytes preferentially migrate to lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissues is still controversial [48]. Naive lymphocytes recirculate to blood and secondary lymphoid tissues until they die or meet antigens for activation in the secondary lymphoid tissues. Secondary lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer's patches, are specialized tissues for collecting antigens and presentation of antigens to lymphocytes [17]. Naive CD4 ϩ T cells express a characteristic set of adhesion molecules: a high level of L-selectin, and low levels of ␣ 4 ␤ 1 , ␣ 4 ␤ 7 , LFA-1, and CD44. This is different from the effector or memory type T cells, and in part explains the migratory behavior of the naive cells to the high endothelial venules (HEV), expressing peripheral node addressin (PNAd), mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule (Mad-CAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 [reviewed in ref . 49]. HEV is a specialized type of post-capillary venule endothelial cells in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Lymphocyte transmigration from peripheral blood to secondary lymphoid organs occurs through the HEV [17,50]. Spleen has no HEV but has a functionally similar endothelial cell layer lining sinuses of the white pulp. It is known that transendothelial migration of lymphocytes or leukocytes occurs in multi-step processes: selectin-mediated attachment and rolling, activation by chemoattractants/chemokines, firm adhesion through activated integrins, and transendothelial migration [14][15][16].\n\nA group of chemokines was examined for inducing adhesion of lymphocytes to ICAM-1 in a static condition, or arrest (firm adhesion) of rolling lymphocytes on PNAd (a ligand of Lselectin) to ICAM-1-coated capillaries in a flow condition that mimics the hydrodynamics of blood vessels [51]. Several chemokines (SDF-1, CK␤-11, SLC, and LARC), but not a number of other chemokines (MIP-1␣, RANTES, Eotaxin, DC-CK-1, lymphotactin, fractalkine, TARC, I-309, IL-8, and MCP-1), induced adhesion to ICAM-1 in a static condition, an activity that was inhibited by pertussis toxin [51]. SDF-1, SLC, and CK␤-11 arrested rolling of most lymphocytes in a flow condition, whereas LARC induced arrest of only memory type, but not naive CD4 ϩ , T cells [51]. SLC also stimulated lymphocytes to adhere to MAdCAM under an in vitro flow condition, which is mediated through activation of ␣ 4 ␤ 7 [52]. Thus, SDF-1, SLC, and CK␤-11 have the potential to induce transendothelial migration of diverse types of lymphocytes to lymph nodes or Peyer's patches.\n\nSDF-1, SLC, and CK␤-11 are unusually strong chemoattractants for lymphocytes [46,47,53]. In chemotaxis chambers, most of the half-million input T cells migrate within 3 h toward these three chemokines. They efficaciously attract most subsets of T cells: CD4, CD8, CD45RA (naive/resting), and CD45RO (memory) T cells [46,47,53]. The optimal concentrations of these chemokines are high (Ͼ100 ng/mL). The optimal concentration of CK␤-11 (Ͼ200 ng/mL) is higher than that of SDF-1 (100-200 ng/mL) [47], but lower than that of SLC (Ͼ1000 ng/mL) [53]. Most other chemokines have optimal concentrations between 0.1 and 100 ng/mL for chemotaxis.\n\nOnce migrated into the lymphoid tissues, naive T cells migrate to T cell-rich zones. Chemokines produced from dendritic cells, T cells, or accessory cells in the T cell-rich zones may play important roles in guiding the trafficking of naive lymphocytes. Dendritic cell-derived chemokines may colocalize the naive T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC) together for initiation of T cell activation. Naive B cells migrate across the T cell zone, where the B cells are initially activated, and then migrate to B cell zones (follicles and germinal centers) of secondary lymphoid tissues for somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation [54][55][56]. SDF-1 is expressed in most tissues including primary and secondary lymphoid tissues [28,45]. Expression of SLC was detected at high levels in the secondary lymphoid tissues [57]. Murine SLC mRNA is detected in the T cell areas of spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches, and in the lymphatic endothelium, but not in germinal centers and sinuses [58]. CK␤-11, like SLC, is detected in T cell areas of spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches [59]. Dendritic cells in secondary lymphoid tissues express CK␤-11 mRNA [59]. DC-CK1, a CC chemokine, is expressed in both germinal centers and T cell-rich areas of tonsils [60]. DC-CK1 specifically attracts naive CD45RA ϩ T cells, but not memory CD45RO ϩ T cells. Again, dendritic cells express DC-CK1 [60]. A mutant mouse defective in T cell homing to lymph nodes has been reported [61]. This mouse has an autosomal recessive gene, plt, at a locus on mouse chromosome 4, which is equivalent to human chromosome 9 [61]. It is interesting to note that the genes of SLC and CK␤-11 are contiguously located on human chromosome 9 (9p13) [31,33,57]. It is possible, but remains to be shown, that the plt locus has defective SLC and/or CK␤-11 genes.\n\nSDF-1, SLC, and CK␤-11 are efficacious chemoattractants for B cells as well [45,47,53]. SDF-1 attracts both CD38 Ϫ CD44 ϩ IgD ϩ naive and CD38 Ϫ CD44 ϩ IgD Ϫ memory B cells [45]. Activation of CD40 or B cell receptor makes B cells chemotactically unresponsive to SDF-1 [45]. In a similar manner, germinal center B cells undergoing activation and maturation are not responsive to SDF-1 [45]. SDF-1 is expressed in cells surrounding the germinal centers, but not in the germinal centers [45]. Thus, the unresponsiveness of germinal center B cells appears to be a mechanism to inhibit the emigration of incompletely matured B cells. BLC, a CXC chemokine, even more efficaciously attracts B cells than SDF-1 [62,63]. BLC is strongly expressed in the follicles (B cell-rich zones) of Peyer's patches, spleen, and lymph nodes [63]. Mice deficient in expression of CXCR5, the receptor for BLC, showed defects in migration of activated B cells from T cell zones to B cell follicles of spleen [64]. The CXCR5-deficient mice lacked inguinal lymph nodes and germinal centers and had fewer Peyer's patches, demonstrating the importance of BLC or its receptor in B cell migration and formation of the germinal centers [64].\n\nTaken together, SDF-1, SLC, CK␤-11, DC-CK1, and BLC are potential factors regulating the basic trafficking of naive lymphocytes from peripheral blood to lymphoid tissues. The microenvironmental expression patterns and chemotactic activity of these chemokines suggest the following: SDF-1, SLC, DC-CK1, and CK␤-11 guide T cell migration to the secondary lymphoid tissues and the T cell zones; SDF-1, SLC, and CK␤-11 may play a role in B cell migration to the lymphoid tissues; BLC induces the formation of germinal centers by directing the migration of B cells to follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues.\n\nAfter activation in the secondary lymphoid tissues by antigens, effector lymphocytes emigrate, circulate through the blood system, and migrate to sites of inflammation [17,65]. The effector lymphocytes specific for a particular antigen migrate to tissues harboring the same antigen, resulting in a localized inflammatory response. As the immune response wanes, memory T cells develop. Memory lymphocytes also have a different migratory behavior from naive lymphocytes, and circulate to tertiary lymphoid tissues including skin, intestines, and other non-lymphoid tissues [65]. However, it has been pointed out that memory lymphocytes circulate to secondary lymphoid tissues as well as to non-lymphoid tissues [48]. Memory cells mainly recirculate to particular tissues where the antigens that activated them originated. Effector T cells express high levels of lymphocyte function antigen (LFA)-1 and CD44, and either\n\nor cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) [reviewed in ref. 49]. Mucosal-homing effector T cells express ␣ 4 ␤ 7 , but not ␣ 4 ␤ 1 [reviewed in ref. 66]. On the contrary, Kim and Broxmeyer Chemokines: signal lamps for lymphocyte trafficking 9\n\nnon-mucosal effector T cells express ␣ 4 ␤ 1 , but not ␣ 4 ␤ 7 . CLA ϩ effector T cells specifically home to the skin [67]. Memory T cells show a similar pattern of adhesion molecule expression, but at lower levels than that of effector cells [49]. Regulation of expression of adhesion molecules or interaction between cell surface adhesion molecules and their ligands on endothelial cells or in the extracellular matrix is important for homing of effector and memory lymphocytes [68]. Chemokines play important roles in recruitment of activated or memory lymphocytes to sites of inflammation or tertiary lymphoid tissues by controlling the activity of integrins and inducing chemotaxis.\n\nOn activation, lymphocytes up-regulate a number of chemokine receptors on their cell surface, which increases the chemotactic sensitivity of lymphocytes to chemokines. Activated T cells express CXCR3 [69,70], CXCR4 [71], CCR1 [72], CCR2 [72,73], CCR3 [70,74], CCR4 [71,74], CCR5 [70,73,75], CCR6 [76], CCR7 [77,78], and CCR8 [79][80][81] (Table 4). Activated T cells can be polarized to either T helper (Th) 1 or Th2 type cells, which demonstrate differential profiles of cytokine expression and helper functions in immune reaction. Th1 cells commonly express IL-2, interferon (IFN)-␥, and lymphotoxin, and are involved in cell-mediated immune responses: cytotoxic and inflammatory responses, delayed-type response, and suppression of B cell function [82]. Th2 cells express IL-4, -5, -6, -9, and -10, and encourage antibody production (especially IgE), eosinophil function, and allergic responses [82]. CD8 ϩ T cytotoxic (Tc) cells can be polarized into Tc1 and Tc2 cells in a manner similar to that of Th1 and Th2 cells [82]. Before polarization into Th1 and Th2 cells, naive cells go through an intermediary stage: Th0 cells expressing IL-2, IL-4, and interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) [83]. Th1 and Th2 cells also differ in expression of adhesion molecules. Th1, but not Th2, cells express P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a functional ligand for E-and P-selectin [84,85]. Chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 are preferentially expressed in Th1 cells over Th2 cells, whereas more CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8 are expressed in Th2 cells than Th1 cells [70, 73-75, 86, 87] (Table 4). Chemotactic responsiveness of Th1 and Th2 cells to chemokines is different from each other and correlates with the chemokine receptor expression profiles in the two types of effector T cells. MIP-1␤ and IP-10 better attracted Th1 cells than Th2 cells, whereas MDC, TARC, I-309, and eotaxin demonstrated higher chemotactic activity for Th2 than for Th1 cells [73,86,88]. Activation by IL-2 is important in maintain-ing cell surface expression levels of some chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 [70,72,75]. Some cytokines have regulatory activity on expression of several chemokine receptors. Transforming growth factor ␤ (TGF-␤) enhances expression of CCR4 and CCR7, and decreases expression of CCR3. IFN-␣ up-regulates the expression of CCR1 and CXCR3, and down-regulates CCR3 [70]. Thus these cytokines regulate not only T cell polarization, but also change the migratory behavior of effector T cells by modulating expression of chemokine receptors.\n\nExpression of CXCR5 in naive B cells is high [89]. After activation with anti-CD40 antibody, B cells lose CXCR5 expression, suggesting that BLC attracts naive B cells to secondary lymphoid tissues, but not activated B cells to inflammatory sites. CXCR4 expression is detected in both naive and activated/memory B cells [45]. Although germinal B cells undergoing affinity maturation also have comparable levels of cell surface CXCR4, they are not responsive to SDF-1 [45]. In vitro-cultured germinal cells regain chemotactic responsiveness to SDF-1 [45]. CCR7 expression is expected on naive B cells because its ligands SLC and CK␤-11 readily attract freshly isolated human and murine B cells well [47,53,58,59]. CCR7 expression is up-regulated in activated B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection [77,90,91]. CCR2 is expressed on both resting and activated CD19 ϩ B cells [92]. In this regard, MCP-1 or agonistic monoclonal antibody to CCR2 induced chemotaxis of B cells [92]. IL-8 and GRO-␣ showed chemotactic activity for B cells in normal and HIV-infected subjects, activity that was inhibited by anti-CXCR2 [93]. CXCR2 expression is higher on cells from HIV-infected subjects, suggesting that these CXCR2 ligands may be involved in trafficking of activated B cells in HIV-infected subjects.\n\nChemokines are expressed in a variety of cell types: monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, stromal cells of various origins, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes, mesangial cells, endothelial cells, T cells, and smooth muscle cells [1,4]. In the previous sections, we have noted the constitutive expression of several chemokines for basal trafficking of immature and naive lymphocytes in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. However, expression of most chemokines is inducible in response to various stimuli. IL-1, TNF-␣, IFN-␥, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and viral infection are the most common inducers of chemokine expression in various tissues [1]. Recruitment of various leukocytes including lymphocytes to inflammatory sites is mediated, in part, through induced production of chemokines.\n\nThe expression profile of chemokines in a particular inflammation site determines the types of infiltrating leukocytes. In rheumatoid arthritis, Th1 cells bearing CCR5 and CXCR3 are common infiltrates into the rheumatoid synovium [75]. In contrast, Th2 cells bearing CCR3 are predominate in allergic diseases such as asthma, contact dermatitis, nasal polyp, and ulcerative colitis, but absent from rheumatoid synovium [94]. In many diseases, the infiltrating T cells themselves produce This table is based on expression of surface protein, mRNA expression, or chemotaxis. CCR6 mediates the chemotaxis and adhesion of memory type T cells in response to MIP-3␣/LARC/Exodus. CCR8, a receptor for I-309, TARC and MIP-1␤, is expressed in IL-2-activated T cells, but not in naive/resting cells [79]. a CCR8 is also expressed in thymus [111], and may mediate chemotaxis of some thymocyte subsets to MIP-1␤. The underlined chemokine receptors are characteristics of Th1 or Th2 cells. chemokines in the infiltration sites. In cutaneous T cell lymphoma, IP-10 is overexpressed [95]. It has been proposed that IFN-␥ produced by lymphoid infiltrate induces the secretion of IP-10 from epidermal keratinocytes. IP-10, a ligand of CXCR3, is chemotactic for the malignant T cells, accounting for its epidermotropism [95]. In patients with multiple sclerosis, CD4 ϩ and CD8 ϩ T cells and macrophages infiltrate white matter. CD8 ϩ T cells, specific for the myelin basic protein, produced MIP-1␣, MIP-1␤, or IP-10, which would keep the infiltrates in the inflammatory sites and further recruit lymphocytes [96]. The chemokines expressed from infiltrating CD8 ϩ T cells are ligands for Th1 chemokine receptors: CCR1, CCR5, and CXCR3. In this regard, multiple sclerosis is a typical Th1 type disease. Developing lymphocytes differentially express chemokine receptors to modulate their chemotactic sensitivity to certain chemokines, which enables them to find and be localized at certain microenvironments/niches in primary/secondary/tertiary lymphoid tissues. Early common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) for T cells and B cells originate from BM. Trafficking of BM HPC is likely to be regulated by SDF-1 and perhaps other as yet unidentified chemokines. Thymic T cell progenitors undergo a number of differentiation stages to become SP thymocytes. At the DP thymocyte thymocytes undergo selection processes that allow only functional thymocytes with no reactivity to self-antigens to proceed into the SP stages. Chemokines such as SDF-1, MIP-1␤, TECK, and CK␤-11 differentially attract thymocyte subsets, a possible trafficking signal for thymocyte migration in thymus. Mature SP T cells migrate and recirculate to secondary lymphoid tissues until they meet specific antigens for activation. T cells are localized in T cell zones in lymph nodes, spleen, or Peyer's patches. Chemokines such as SDF-1, SLC, CK␤-11, and DC-CK1 have the potential to be involved in the migration of naive T cells to T cell zones. These chemokines are expressed in secondary lymphoid tissues or more specifically in T cell zones. B cells with specific surface antigen receptors are generated in BM. They also undergo antigen-dependent selection at an immature (IgD ϩ IgM Ϫ ) stage. Mature (naive) IgD ϩ IgM ϩ B cells migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissues. SDF-1, CK␤-11, SLC, and BLC are possible chemoattractants for the migration of naive B cells to secondary lymphoid tissues. Naive B cells catch, internalize, and process antigens in the secondary lymphoid tissues and present them to T cells in the T cell zones. With the help of T cells (cytokines and cognate interaction), B cells proliferate and differentiate. Activated B cells form germinal centers and go through affinity maturation and somatic mutation in the germinal centers in B cell areas (follicles) of the secondary lymphoid tissues. The efficacious B cell chemoattractant, BLC, is expressed in the follicles of the secondary lymphoid tissues. BLC and its receptor CXCR5 are essential to form and maintain the germinal centers. Activation at germinal centers of the secondary lymphoid tissues also modulates chemotactic responsiveness, but not receptor expression (CXCR4), of B cells to SDF-1. Most chemokine receptors: CCR1 to CCR8, CXCR2, CXCR3, and CXCR4, appear to be involved in the migration of effector/memory lymphocytes. CCR7 or CXCR4 ligands: SLC, CK␤-11, and SDF-1 are also chemotactically active for activated lymphocytes. Antibody-producing B cells (plasma cells) are found not only in the secondary lymphoid tissues (red pulp of spleen, and the medulla and deep cortex of lymph nodes), but also in the BM, a major site of antibody production. SDF-1, produced from BM stromal cells, has the potential to attract plasma cells to the BM (see text for details and references).\n\nLocalized chemokine expression is a universal prerequisite for infiltration of leukocytes in most diseases. Transgenic mice expressing MCP-1 under the regulation of an insulin promoter showed a chronic insulitic infiltrate composed of monocytes and low numbers of CD4 ϩ , CD8 ϩ , and B cells [97]. Systemic expression of MCP-1 did not induce the infiltration, suggesting localized expression of chemokines is critical for recruitment of leukocytes [97]. Intradermal injection of RANTES into both allergic and nonallergic subjects induces infiltration of CD45RO ϩ T cells and CD3 ϩ T cells [98]. Infiltration of eosinophils was observed only in the allergic patients. It is likely that eosinophils from these subjects are primed/ preactivated in vivo, or the infiltrates in allergic subjects, but not normal subjects, may express eosinophil chemoattractants. Transplantation-associated accelerated atherosclerosis is an alloimmune response involving infiltration of the vessel wall by T lymphocytes and monocytes, leading to smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. RANTES is expressed in this disease and induces the lymphocyte infiltration [99]. Leukocytes infiltrating the epithelial ovarian tumors were CD8 ϩ CD45RO ϩ T cells and CD68 ϩ macrophages with low numbers of NK cells, B cells, and mast cells. MCP-1, MIP-1␣, MIP-1␤, and RANTES were expressed in ovarian tumors [100,101]. Infiltration of leukocytes is also observed in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium of the kidney during endotoxemia. RANTES is expressed in the infiltrated kidney. Expression of RANTES in the kidney is down-regulated by activation of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, suggesting the regulatory role of the NO pathway in expression of inflammatory chemokines [102]. Not only diseases but also injuries induce expression of chemokines. In an experimental spinal cord injury model in mice, chemokines (MIP-1␣ and MIP-1␤) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-␣ and IL-1) are up-regulated within the first hour after injury [103]. In this case, resident central nervous system (CNS) cells (e.g., microglial cells), but not the infiltrates, appear to be the main expression source of cytokines and chemokines.\n\nThe role of many chemokines is somewhat redundant because a number of chemokines, but not all, promiscuously share receptors for induction of leukocyte chemotaxis. Due to this promiscuity, redundancy and the sheer numbers of chemokines and chemokine receptors, we still do not clearly understand the specific role of many chemokines in the process of lymphocyte migration. It appears that multiple chemokines interact and direct the migration of lymphocytes in a given tissue microenvironment. It has been reported that some viral chemokines (vMIP-II of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; a molluscum contagiosum virus type I chemokine) inhibited the chemotactic activity of the host's chemokines [104,105], suggesting a possible mechanism to avoid the host immune system.\n\nChemokines are important in lymphocyte development and function by guiding the migration of various types of lymphocytes: immature, mature/naive, effector, and memory types (Fig. 1). Developing lymphocytes regulate the expression of chemokine receptors and/or responsiveness to chemokines. Tissue-specific expression of chemokines, constitutively or on induction in certain conditions, provides crucial direction for migrating lymphocytes. Although the chemotactic activity of many chemokines appears to be similar, the differential role of each chemokine begins to be revealed. It remains to be seen how chemokines regulate specific lymphocyte trafficking in the context of adhesion to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix of microenvironments. Detailed knowledge on the targets and roles of each chemokine or chemokine receptor during lymphocyte trafficking will provide valuable information for clinical applications: intervention of pathological localization of lymphocytes; regulation of immune reaction by controlling the lymphocyte migration for development and activation; blocking the infection of pathogens exploiting chemokine receptors for infection, including the human immunodeficiency virus.\n\nJournal of Leukocyte Biology Volume 65, January 1999 http://www.jleukbio.org\n\nJournal of Leukocyte Biology Volume 65, January 1999 http://www.jleukbio.org\n\nJournal of Leukocyte Biology Volume 65, January 1999 http://www.jleukbio.org\n\nJournal of Leukocyte Biology Volume 65, January 1999 http://www.jleukbio.org\n\nJournal of Leukocyte Biology Volume 65, January 1999 http://www.jleukbio.org"
