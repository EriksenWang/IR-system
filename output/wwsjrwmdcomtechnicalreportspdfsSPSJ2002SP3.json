    "abstract": "During the spring of 2000 and 2001, the Blue Cypress Marsh Conservation Area and the Blue Cypress Water Management Area (collectively referred to as the BCM) within the watershed of the upper St. Johns River were surveyed to determine the breeding activity of Snail Kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). A total of six nests were located within this area in 2000, but only one in 2001. There has been a general decrease in nesting activity and nest success in the BCM since 1992, though it is unlikely that low apple snail densities or habitat change are contributing factors. A recent study by\nDreitz et al. (2002)\nwas unable to detect any significant change in the Florida snail kite population or the rate of population change, suggesting reasons other than population decline are affecting the numbers of kites nesting and frequenting the BCM. Kites exhibit considerable variation in their spatial and temporal distribution, as well as areas of concentrated nesting activity. Breeding activity of snail kites is monitored annually in the watersheds of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River Valley and Loxahatchee Slough. During the 2000 breeding season, the majority of nests were located on the western side of Water Conservation Area 3 A (WCA3A), while in 2001 98% of the nesting activity was located on East and West Lake Tohopekaliga and Lake Kissimmee. The total number of nests found in all of the surveyed areas in 2000 (166) was more than three times that of the 2001 total (49). The 2001 breeding season was impacted by a widespread drought, resulting in the complete absence of nesting activity and the dispersion of kites from virtually all of the surveyed wetlands, with the exception of the aforementioned central Florida lake habitats.\nDuring such events, smaller, hydrologically disjunct wetlands (such as the BCM) and lacustrine systems become increasingly important to the kites as areas of refuge. Had the BCM been less affected by the 2001 drought, the number of kites frequenting the area and the nesting activity could have been substantially higher. A variety of smaller, isolated wetlands are important for creating a mosaic of hydrologic regimes in the network of wetlands used by snail kites in central and southern Florida.",
    "full_text": "The snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) is an endangered raptor that inhabits flooded freshwater areas and shallow lakes in peninsular Florida and Cuba (Sykes 1984, Sykes et al. 1995). The historical range of the snail kite covered over 4000 km 2 (2480 mi 2 ) of Florida, including the panhandle region (Sykes et al. 1995), but is now restricted mainly to the watersheds of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, Loxahatchee Slough, the Kissimmee River, and the Upper St. Johns River. These habitats exhibit considerable variation in their physiographic and vegetative characteristics, and include graminoid marshes (wet prairies, sloughs), cypress swamps, lake shorelines, and even some highly disturbed areas such as agricultural ditches or retention ponds (Bennetts and Kitchens 1997a). Two features that remain constant in the variety of selected habitats are the presence of apple snails and areas of sparsely distributed emergent vegetation (Sykes 1983b(Sykes , 1987a)), both of which are critical to the nesting and foraging success of the snail kite.\n\nSnail kites are dietary specialists, feeding almost exclusively on one species of aquatic apple snail, Pomacea paludosa (Sykes 1987a, Sykes et al. 1995). They use two visual foraging methods, either flying 1.5-10m above the water surface or hunting from a perch (Sykes 1987a) and both require open water or sparse vegetation. Kites usually nest in woody vegetation overhanging water, such as willows, bald cypress, wax myrtle, elderberry, etc. (Beissinger 1988, Bennetts et al. 1988). The snail kite's survival depends on those hydrologic conditions that support these specific vegetative communities and subsequent apple snail availability in at least a subset of wetlands across the region each year.\n\nWetland habitats throughout central and southern Florida are constantly fluctuating in response to climatic or managerial influences, resulting in a mosaic of hydrologic regimes. Snail kites respond to these fluctuations through regular movement among the network of wetlands in central and southern Florida (Bennetts andKitchens, 1997a, 1997b). Hydrologic conditions are likely to be similar among wetlands within the same watershed, making wetlands in multiple watersheds extremely important for increased habitat variation (Bennetts andKitchens 1997a, 1997b). Wetlands such as the Blue Cypress Marsh Conservation Area and the Blue Cypress Water Management Area (referred to collectively as the BCM) that are essentially hydrologically disjunct from other major wetlands are an extremely important component to the long-term viability of snail kites in Florida. This report will present data on the abundance and breeding activities of snail kites in the BCM for the reproductive years 2000 and 2001, as well as comparative data for other wetlands in the central and south Florida wetland network. This monitoring is required by the biological opinion ).\n\nThe BCM comprise approximately 6,000 ha (15,000 ac) of marsh within the Upper St.\n\nJohns River Basin in Indian River County, FL (Figure 1). Toland (1991Toland ( ,1992Toland ( , and 1994) ) describes the vegetation and hydrologic characteristics of the BCM. This area is a small part of the network of wetlands that are monitored for snail kites each year. The population of snail kites is best viewed as one continuous population that is distributed among a network of heterogeneous wetland units in central and southern Florida (Bennetts andKitchens 1997a, 1997b). They use the entire spatial extent of their range, exhibiting considerable interchange among wetland units (Rodgers and Stangel 1996, Bennetts and Kitchens 1997a, 1997b). Our study area includes a large portion of these different wetland units used by snail kites in peninsular Florida.\n\nSampling Duration. During the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons, snail kite nests were monitored from March to June. This time period coincides with the occurrence of peak nesting activity in this population of snail kites (Bennetts and Kitchens 1997a).\n\nSampling Methods. Six consecutive surveys were conducted each year throughout the BCM and other designated wetland units (Figure 1) from March to June at 2-3 week intervals.\n\nThe surveys followed a format similar to the quasi-systematic transects conducted by airboat for the annual count (Sykes 1979(Sykes ,1982;;Rodgers et al. 1988, Bennetts et al. 1994). In other words, transects were run in general directions and locations each survey, rather than with specific coordinates, so as to fully survey the area to the extent the water levels and vegetation structure allowed. Six surveys were conducted each year from March through June in 2000 and 2001.\n\nNest monitoring followed guidelines suggested by Bennetts (1988 et. al). Though some studies (Beissinger 1986, Snyder et al. 1989) have considered nest building (prior to egg laying) as the beginning of a breeding/nesting attempt, we followed the protocol of Steenhof (1987) who considered a nesting attempt to begin with the laying of the first egg. This definition was preferred for this species because pair bonds are not often established before eggs are laid.\n\nFailures at this stage are more appropriately deemed courtship failures rather than nesting failures (Bennetts et al. 1994). A nest was considered successful when at least one young reached 24 days of age (80% of the age of first flight) (Steenhof and Kochert 1982). After this time, fledglings begin to leave the nest and may or may not be found in the immediate vicinity of the nest.\n\nNests were checked with a telescoping mirror pole to determine their status. Water depths at each nest were determined by placing a meter stick vertically into the water column until it rested on the sediment. Nesting substrate and height were also recorded.\n\nAnalysis. For nest success estimates we used only those nests found during the egg laying stage to eliminate biases (e.g. overestimation of nest success) associated with finding nests after hatching. The Mayfield method (Mayfield 1961(Mayfield ,1975) ) takes into account such biases (Hensler and Nichols 1981), but not enough nests were present in this study to satisfy the suggested sample size (n=20) (Hensler and Nichols 1981) for such an analysis. Thus, nest success was determined using only those nests found during the egg stage and is defined as the number of successful nests/the number of nests.\n\nIn 2000,6 nests were reported in the BCM and only 1 in 2001. Statewide, 166 nests were found in 2000, while only 49 nests were found in 2001 (Table 1). 29 of the 49 nests in 2001 were on Lake Kissimmee where monitoring is performed by Jim Rodgers of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC). The overwhelming majority of nesting activity in 2001 took place on 3 lakes within our study areas, as 48 of the 49 nests were located on Lake Kissimmee, East Lake Tohopekaliga and West Lake Tohopekaliga. l Wildlife Refuge Water Conservation Area-2A Water Conservation Area-2B Water Conservation Area-3A 105 43 Water Conservation Area-SB 26 15 WPB Water Catchment Area TOTAL 156 1 70 49 18 10 nests were excluded from our analysis as their success was unknown Nest monitoring on Kissimmee is conducted by Jim Rodgers of the FFWCC -only 2001 data is shown 3 No monitoring was performed on East Lake Tohopekaliga in 2000\n\nIn the BCM from 1990-1999, the average percentage of nests hi coastal plain willow (Salix caroliniand) was 39%, while the average percentage of nests in cypress was only 11%. In 2000 and 2001, however, willows were not used at all, while 5 out of 7 (67%) nests in the BCM were cypress. The other two substrates used were cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) and pond apple (Annona glabrd). Cypress (Taxodium spp.) was the most common nesting substrate statewide in the 2000 breeding season, while pond apple (Annona glabra) was the most common from 1996-1999. Cattail (Typha spp.) was the most common substrate used in 2001, due to 48 of the 49 nests having occurred in lakes, where other substrates are less available, particularly under low water conditions.\n\nStatewide nest success for 2000 was 35%, the highest success rate since 1997 (46%). This rate falls within the range of 32% (Snyder et al. 1989) to 50% (Sykes 1987b). Nest success in the BCM was only 16.7% (1 of 6 nests) in 2000, and in 2001 the single nest in the BCM was successful. The 2000 rates are higher than reported for 1998 in the BCM, though still well below the rates reported from 1991-1996 (Table 2).  3).  2). This range is similar to the ranges observed in previous years: 1999,10-84 birds (Dreitz et. al. 1999);1998, 18-51 (Dreitz et al. 1998););1997, 31 to 129 (Dreitz et al. 1997)); 1996, 20 to 74 (Dreitz et al. 1996); 1995 13 to 41 (Bennetts et al. 1995);and 1994, 7 to 30 (Bennetts and Kitchens 1994). The largest number of kites observed in the statewide monitoring, or the combination of all the surveyed wetlands, was 526, observed from March 1 to March 20 (Figure 3). In 2001, the largest number of kites observed (474) was on the third survey, from April 7 to May 3. There was a sharp decline in the total number of birds as well as a shift in the distribution during the middle of the 2001 season (Figure 3). Statewide, the total number shifted from 474 to 277 birds from mid April to mid May, similar to the decline from 57 to 16 birds observed in the BCM during the same time period. The total number of birds observed in the Water Conservation Areas declined from 289 in mid April to 40 in mid May. The lake habitats, however, showed a different trend, as their totals went from 99 in mid April to 138 in mid May (Figure 4). Such a trend was not evident for the 2000 breeding season (Figure 5).\n\nNineteen individual snail kites that were originally banded in the BCM either as juveniles or adults from 1991-1998 were seen throughout central and southern Florida in the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons (Table 4). Most of the individuals observed were still in the BCM. Other wetland areas where BCM kites were observed included; West Palm Beach Water Catchment Area, Lake Kissimmee, Water Conservation Area 3 A, and Northeast Shark River Slough (Everglades National Park).\n\nTable 4.

Such spatial and temporal variation of kite distributions makes it important to consider the entire study area when making inferences of the population.\n\nConsiderable declines in the number of kites or number of successful nests in one area does not necessarily imply population declines, or even habitat degradation in that area. Some smaller wetlands, for example, may only see significant kite use during years that other larger wetland systems exhibit unfavorable conditions (Bennetts and Kitchens 1997a). Recent studies have also suggested that kites may actually increase their movement during times of food abundance, rather than under stressful conditions. (Bennetts et al. 2000). This exploratory behavior is probably important for kites in determining where available habitats are, so that they can quickly relocate when necessary.\n\nThe 2001 breeding season offered a unique opportunity to observe kite behavior in tunes of drought, as many of the primary wetland units were dry for the majority of the breeding season, including Lake Okeechobee, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress, WCA3B and even much of WCA1, WCA2A, WCA2B, WCA3A, and the BCM. The drying of these habitats was evident in the decline of the number of kites surveyed between mid April and mid May of 2001 (Figure 4). The two northern lake habitats (Kissimmee and Tohopekaliga), however, did not reflect the same decrease in surveyed kites throughout the season (Figure 4). These lakes maintained high enough water levels to provide refuge for kites, though many probably dispersed to other peripheral habitats, like agricultural ditches and reservoirs (Bennetts and Kitchens 1997a).\n\nThe effects of the drought in 2001 were also evident in the BCM where nesting activity was lower than had been previously recorded (Table 1). The numbers of kites surveyed in the BCM also reflected the low water levels, dropping from 57 hi mid April to 16 in mid May (Figure 4). Such a dramatic decline in numbers was not expressed hi 2000, where over the same period of time the total birds surveyed in the BCM went from 25 to 27.\n\nAlthough nesting activity in the BCM has basically declined since 1992, the exact cause cannot easily be determined. For example, the BCM may simply be used more as a refuge by the kites, only using it extensively when other areas are drier, or have lower food availability. This would not imply that the BCM are of less importance to the kite population, but rather they and other smaller, hydrologically disjunct wetlands are extremely important to kites during times of food scarcity, drought, or other factors that necessitate large scale shifts in distribution.\n\nHad the drought in 2001 been more localized and restricted to the southern portions of the state and the BCM been less affected, more kites may have used the area, much as they used the northern lakes in the latter part of the 2001 season. There were a large number of kites foraging in West Ansin of the BCM early in the breeding season before our first survey; well over 50 within one cell (personal observation). However, as water levels decreased, the kites moved out of the area. It is possible that water levels were too low at the beginning of the breeding season for many of the kites to even attempt nesting. In WCA3A, where the majority of nesting activity took place in 2000, no nests or courtship activity (calls or displays) were ever observed in the 2001 breeding season. Additionally, the littoral marshes of Lake Okeechobee, WCA3B, and the Everglades National Park were mostly dry before March.\n\nThe recent decline in kite use and nesting activity in the BCM is not believed to be a result of a decreasing population. Recent studies by Dreitz et al. (2002) have been unable to discern any significant change in the total population of the snail kite in Florida (Figure 6) or the rate of population change (Figure 7). When the surveyed habitats dry down and the kites disperse, fewer nests are observed and marked birds are seen less frequently. Fewer marked birds were seen in 2001 than in 2000 or 1999, most likely as a result of dispersion to unsurveyed, peripheral habitats rather than population decline.\n\nThe fact that kites are still nesting in the BCM, albeit minimally, suggests that the habitat is at least sufficient for reproduction. During the 2000 and 2001 breeding season surveys, 10 of the kites banded in the BCM from 1992-1996, either as juveniles or adults, were still observed in the BCM (Table 4). Birds banded in other locations still frequent the BCM as well, which again suggests suitable habitat. Through 2000 and 2001 kites that were banded in WCA3A, WCA2B, Lake Okeechobee, Lake Tohopekaliga, Lake Jackson and Northeast Shark River Slough were observed in the BCM. It is very likely that kites from other areas also frequent the BCM, though without bands the quantity and origin of those birds are unknown. Also of interest, a snail kite banded as a juvenile in 1979 in WCA3A was seen in the BCM in 2001, one of the oldest birds ever reported (>22yrs).

Productivity and nest success also increased from 1999 lows. In 2001, however, nesting activity was basically nonexistent in every area surveyed other than East and West Lake Tohopekaliga and Lake Kissimmee. In fact, 48 of the 49 nests located in 2001\n\nwere on these three lakes. In contrast, of the 166 nests found in 2000, only 7 were on West Lake Tohopekaliga (2000 Kissimmee data unavailable). While higher water levels in general may have contributed to the higher estimates for the 2000 breeding season, Dreitz et al. (2001) suggested that annual minimum water levels in wetland units are not the major determinant of nest success. The temporal and spatial variations in the estimates of nest success are most likely a reflection of the dynamic environment snail kites inhabit. Not only do the hydrological conditions have to support significant apple snail densities, but they must also support the vegetative communities that make those snails available to the kites. Woody vegetation used as nesting substrate and graminoid species that are essential for foraging habitat require periodic drying to reproduce and/or survive (Craighead 1971, Gunderson and Loftus 1993, Gunderson 1994). Increased hydroperiods can lead to vegetative changes that reduce suitable nesting habitat (Kitchens et al. 2002) and when these short hydroperiod habitats do get dry, nesting and foraging activities are halted. Indeed, the very events that sustain the ecosystems that snail kites inhabit force the birds to leave periodically.\n\nGiven the fact that areas of concentrated nesting vary temporally as well as spatially, it is possible that during some years nesting may simply take place in areas not included in this study. Lake Kissimmee, for example, is monitored annually for nesting activity by Jim Rodgers (FFWCC) and the data for this area before 2001 have not been included in our analyses. Lake\n\n1 These figures include data from Lake Kissimmee, while 1997-2000 do not\n\nSnail Kites Observed in the BCM and Other Surveyed Wetlands\n\nSix surveys were conducted in the BCM from March 1 -June 5 of 2000 and six more from March 15 -June 15 of 2001.
