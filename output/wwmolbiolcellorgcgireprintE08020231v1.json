    "abstract": "How scaffold proteins integrate signaling pathways with cytoskeletal components to drive axon outgrowth is not well understood. We report here that the multi-domain scaffold protein POSH (Plenty of SH3s) regulates axon outgrowth. Reduction of POSH function by RNA interference (RNAi) enhances axon outgrowth in differentiating mouse primary cortical neurons and in neurons derived from mouse P19 cells, suggesting POSH negatively regulates axon outgrowth.\nComplementation analysis reveals a requirement for the third SH3 domain of POSH, and we find that the actomyosin regulatory protein Shroom3 interacts with this domain of POSH. Inhibition of Shroom3 expression by RNAi leads to increased process lengths, as observed for POSH RNAi, suggesting that POSH and Shroom function together to inhibit process outgrowth.\nComplementation analysis and interference of protein function by dominant negative approaches\nsuggest that Shroom3 recruits Rho kinase (ROCK) to inhibit process outgrowth. Further, inhibition of myosin II function reverses the POSH or Shroom3 RNAi phenotype, indicating a role for myosin II regulation as a target of the POSH-Shroom complex. Collectively, these results suggest that the molecular scaffold protein POSH assembles an inhibitory complex that links to the actin-myosin network to regulate neuronal process outgrowth.",
    "full_text": "Neurite outgrowth is a dynamic and complex process. Axons undergo multiple cycles of extension and retraction, attachment and release, attraction and repulsion. Guidance cues, intracellular signaling pathways, and cytoskeletal components are critical players in each of these events. Yet, how signaling pathways, cytoskeletal components and extracellular cues are coordinately regulated during process outgrowth is still incompletely understood.\n\nPlenty of SH3s (POSH) is a multi-domain scaffold protein comprised of four Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, a Rac binding domain, and a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain. POSH assembles an active c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) module comprised of Mixed Lineage Kinase (MLK) 1-3/Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK), MKK4/7, and JNK1/2 (Tapon et al., 1998;Xu et al., 2003). POSH interacts with activated Rac, which activates a subset of MLK family members, notably the Cdc42/Racinteractive binding (CRIB) domain containing MLKs MLK1-3 (Tapon et al., 1998;Gallo and Johnson, 2002). Akt negatively regulates POSH associated JNK signaling and Rac binding (Figueroa et al., 2003;Lyons et al., 2007). POSH functions as a pro-apoptotic protein in fibroblasts, mature neurons, and Xenopus embryos by activating JNK signaling (Tapon et al., 1998;Xu et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005;Xu et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2006). In addition to regulating apoptosis, roles for POSH in regulating calcium homeostasis, membrane trafficking, and HIV production have been reported (Alroy et al., 2005;Kim et al., 2006;Tuvia et al., 2007).\n\nFurther, POSH was identified in a genetic modifier screen in Drosophila for mutants with morphological defects in dorsal appendages, suggesting a role for POSH in regulating cell shape change (Schnorr et al., 2001).\n\nShroom3 is an F-actin binding protein that regulates apical constriction through a myosin II dependent pathway (Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999;Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005). In Shroom3 deficient mice, the neural folds fail to converge at the dorsal midline and \"mushroom\" outward, resulting in exencephaly, acrania, facial clefting, and spinal bifida (Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999). Shroom family members are characterized by the presence of a conserved ASD2 (Apx/Shroom) domain (Staub et al., 1992;Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999;Fairbank et al., 2006;Etournay et al., 2007;Yoder and Hildebrand, 2007). In Shroom3, the ASD2 domain elicits apical constriction through the actomyosin network (Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005). Shroom3 regulates myosin II by recruiting Rho kinase (ROCK) through the ASD2 domain (Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). A second conserved domain, the ASD1 domain, targets Shroom family members 1-3 to actin (Yoder and Hildebrand, 2007). Shroom3 is widely expressed during embryonic development. In addition to expression in the neural tube, Shroom3 is expressed in the forebrain, including the cortex, somites, heart, gut and skeletal muscle (Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999). Thus, Shroom3 may have roles in other cellular events, in addition to apical constriction during neural tube closure.\n\nIn this report, we demonstrate that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of POSH in two neuronal model systems, differentiating P19 neurons and mouse primary cortical neurons, specifically enhances axon outgrowth, thus implicating POSH in negative regulation of axon outgrowth. Complementation analysis demonstrates a requirement for the third SH3 domain of POSH in process outgrowth inhibition and we identify Shroom3 as a binding partner for the third SH3 domain of POSH. Endogenous Shroom3 and POSH co-associate and RNAimediated reduction of Shroom3, like POSH, enhances axon outgrowth in differentiating primary cortical neurons, suggesting that POSH and Shroom3 work in concert to negatively regulate process outgrowth. Shroom3 is an F-actin binding protein that couples to a myosin II dependent pathway (Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005). For Shroom3 to inhibit process outgrowth, both the actin binding and ASD2 domains are required, and the ASD2 domain couples to ROCK to inhibit process outgrowth. Finally, inhibition of myosin II suppresses the POSH or Shroom RNAi phenotype, suggesting that upregulation of myosin II in POSH or Shroom RNAi neurons is the driving force behind the enhanced process outgrowth. Together, these results support the model that the multi-domain scaffold protein POSH assembles an inhibitory complex, which includes the actomyosin regulatory protein Shroom3 and its partner ROCK, to regulate process outgrowth. Yeast two-hybrid library screen. A yeast two hybrid screen of a 9.5/10.5 day mouse embryo cDNA library was performed, as described, to identify proteins that interact with the third and fourth SH3 domains of POSH (amino acids 447-892) (Vojtek et al., 1993;Vojtek and Hollenberg, 1995).\n\nRNA interference. pCS2-SIBR and pUI4/5 are siRNA expression vectors based on the miR-155 microRNA precursor RNA (Chung et al., 2006). The 22 nucleotide miR-155 sequence is replaced by an siRNA that is perfectly complementary to the target mRNA of interest. The siRNA precursor (the SIBR cassette) is expressed under the control of the RNA polymerase II simian CMV promoter in pCS2 or under control of the UbiquitinC promoter in pUI4/5. siRNAs and a fluorescent or selectable marker (GFP or puromycin) are expressed from a single vector based transcript in the UI4 vector. The UI5 vector is a derivative of UI4 in which an IRES element has been positioned upstream of the coding region for GFP and downstream of a polylinker. The UI5 complementation vectors, Figure 4, are created by inserting cDNAs encoding full length POSH or POSH mutants deleted for various domains into the polylinker of UI5. Thus, the UI5 vectors express siRNAs, GFP and POSH, wild type or deletion mutants, from a single transcription unit. POSH, Shroom3 and myosin IIA siRNAs target sequences located within 3' untranslated regions (UTR). The sequence of the siRNAs are: POSH-1, 5' UUACACAUCAGAACCCAGAGAG 3'; POSH-2, 5' UUGAAGAUCUGGAAGUCCACAG 3'; POSH-6, 5' UAAGCUUUCUCCGUGUCCCGUC; Shrm3-1, 5'UUUUGCCCAGGGCUUACAGGAG 3'; Shrm3-3, 5'UUUGUAGUGAAAUCGCUUUCAG 3';Luc (luciferase, control), 5' UUUAUGAGGAUCUCUCUGAUUU 3'; myosin IIA-1 (Myh9), 5'AUUAAAUAUAUUUGGUCCCCUA 3', Robo-1, 5' UAUUUUGCUAUCAAUUAGCGUG 3', and EphrinB2-1, 5' UAACACCCGAAUCCAUAGACGG 3'. POSH 1+2 expresses both POSH-1 and POSH-2 siRNAs from two SIBR cassettes in tandem. The POSH-6 and Luc SIBR cassettes have been previously published as POSH-2852 and Luc-1601 (Chung et al., 2006).\n\nFor testing the ability of the siRNAs to target endogenous POSH, Shroom3 or myosin IIA, western analysis was performed on extracts prepared from transiently transfected, puromycin selected P19 cells, as previously described for short hairpin siRNAs (Vojtek et al., 2003;Yu et al., 2003). The POSH mutants used in the complementation analysis are: POSH ฮRing, amino acids 53-892; POSHฮ4, amino acids 1-519; and POSH ฮ3/4, amino acids 1-382.\n\nNeuronal Differentiation assays. P19 cells, grown in MEMฮฑ (Gibco) supplemented with 7.5% calf serum (Hyclone), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), were plated the day before transfection to a density of 1.1 x 10 5 cells per 35 mm dish.\n\nCells were transfected with an expression vector for the neural basic helix-loop-helix protein (bHLH) Neurogenin1 (Ngn1) or Neurogenin2 (Ngn2), pCS2-Ngn1 or pUS-Ngn2 (1.5 ฮผg), pCS2\n\nSIBR control or pCS2 SIBR POSH siRNA expression vector (1.5 ฮผg), and either pCS2-GFP or pUS2-GFP, a derivative of pCS2 that expresses GFP under the control of the human ubiquitinC promoter instead of simian CMV (0.75 ฮผg) using Fugene (Roche), Figure 1. In Figure 4, P19 cells were plated to a density of 0.9 x 10 4 cells/well of a 12-well dish and transfected the next day with 2 ฮผg total DNA [0.75 ฮผg Ngn2, 1.25 ฮผg pUI4/UI5 RNAi expression vector]. In Figure 8, pUS2-R1C1, which expresses the Shroom3 binding domain of human Rock1, aa 698-957, was transfected at 850ng/12-well. Four to six hours after transfection, cells were re-split 1:5 or 1:6 to laminin coated dishes. 18-20 hrs later, the cells were transferred to Opti-MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 1% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. 3-4 days after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS and stained for GFP or neuronal markers of differentiation (Farah et al., 2000;Vojtek et al., 2003). Similar results were obtained when outgrowth assays were performed on poly-L-lysine or laminin coated dishes.\n\nCortical primary progenitors were isolated from the dorsal telencephalon of mouse embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). Freshly dissociated cells were transfected using an Amaxa AAD-1001 Nucleofector. In Figure 2, cells were transfected with UI4-Luciferase control or UI4-POSH6 (6 ฮผg). In Figure 6, cells were co-transfected with pCS2 SIBR POSH 1+2, pCS2 SIBR Shroom 3-1, or pCS2 SIBR-luciferase (control luciferase siRNA) expression vector (4 ฮผg) and a GFP expression vector (2.2-2.5 ฮผg). In Figure 7A, dissociated cells were cotransfected with pUbc-Shroom3 ABD (aa 754-952) or pUS2 control expression vectors (5ฮผg) and pUS2+GFP expression vector (2 ฮผg). In Figure 9, cells were co-transfected with UI4-POSH6 or UI4-luciferase RNAi expression vectors (3 ฮผg) and either UI4-luciferase or UI4-myosin IIA RNAi expression vectors (3 ฮผg). To enhance cell survival, untransfected cortical progenitors (0.4-0.7x10 5 cells per well) were plated to poly-L-lysine-laminin coated 12-well dishes (Corning), then electroporated cells (0.6-1 x 10 7 cells total per electroporation; 5-9 x 10 5 cells per well) were layered over the untransfected cortical progenitors, and allowed to differentiate in monolayer culture in serum-free media [L15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 26 mM NaHCO 3 (Sigma), 1% N2 (Invitrogen), 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 30 mM glucose (Sigma), 1% penicillin/streptomycin]. 10 ng/ml bFGF (R&D) was added to the media for 2-3 hours or overnight, then withdrawn to foster differentiation. Neuronal process outgrowth was monitored over time by visualization of GFP fluorescence. 24 hours after nucleofection (day 2), the majority of GFP positive, transfected cells had not yet extended processes. By day 3, the GFP positive cells had extended processes, and process outgrowth continued into day 4. Cells were fixed 3 and 4 days after transfection and stained with anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes).\n\nMeasurement of process length. To measure process length, photographs of fixed, stained neurons were captured with a digital camera and the length of the longest process per cell measured using the perimeter/length function in NIH Image 1.33 (Figure 1), the length function in NIH ImageJ 1.63 (Figure 6), or the measurement (polyline) function in MicroSuite Special Edition imaging software version 5.0 (Olympus). The longest process per cell is positive for\n\nTau, an axonal marker. As needed, several photographs were joined in Adobe Photoshop to measure the length of the complete process. Processes 50 ฮผm or greater were measured; 50 ฮผm is approximately three times the length of the cell body. Process length is determined in two or more independent experiments, 100 neurons per condition per experiment. Similar results for process length measurements are obtained if neurons are fixed and stained for GFP or for neuronal markers of differentiation (ฮฒ-III-tubulin). Caspase inhibitor assay. P19 cells were split to a density of 0.8 x 10 5 /12 well plate and transfected 24 hrs later using TransIT (Mirus) with US2+mNgn2 (0.75 ฮผg) and pUI4-GFP-Luc1601 (1.25 ฮผg). Transfected cells were replated to laminin coated 12-well plates about 5 hrs after transfection. 24 hrs after transfection the media was changed to differentiating media (Opti-MEM + 1% FBS) supplemented with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Promega) (20 ยตM) or DMSO (vehicle control). The cells were further incubated with the inhibitor for 48 hrs, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde about 72 hrs after transfection, and were stained for neuronal beta III-tubulin (TuJ1 antibody, Covance) and GFP (Invitrogen). Process length was determined using the polyline function from MicroSuite Special Edition imaging software version 5.0 (Olympus). with a rabbit anti-His antibody (CST), followed by addition of Protein A/G Sepharose (1:1, Sigma/Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western analysis with a mouse anti-GST antibody (Zymed) and anti-His antibody. GST-POSH SH3-3\n\n(1/10) and His-Shroom3 PBD (1/50) input proteins were included as loading controls.\n\nIn Figure 5C, E16.5 mouse embryo brains were homogenized in PBST (+) buffer (Phosphate Buffered Saline pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.1% ฮฒ-mercaptoethanol, 1% aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 2 ฮผM leupeptin, 1 ฮผM pepstatin). Homogenates were sonicated, passed through cheesecloth, and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm at 4 o C for 30 minutes. IMR-32 cell extracts were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 ฮผM leupeptin, 1 ฮผM pepstatin) and subjected to sonication. After sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 o C. Clarified extracts were pre-cleared with Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 o C. Brain homogenates and IMR-32 extracts were incubated overnight at 4 o C with 2 ฮผg of goat polyclonal Shroom3 antibody (SantaCruz T-17) pre-bound to protein A/G Sepharose (Sigma/Amersham). For the negative control immunoprecipitations, brain homogenates and IMR32 extracts were incubated with a goat polyclonal antibody (SantaCruz E-20), pre-bound to protein A/G Sepharose. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western analysis.\n\nPOSH mRNA is present throughout the developing central nervous system of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse embryos (data not shown). The expression of POSH in the developing CNS suggests that POSH may play a role in neuronal differentiation. To investigate the role of endogenous POSH during neuronal differentiation, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce POSH function. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting murine POSH were expressed in cells using the CS2+SIBR RNAi expression vector. The SIBR (Short Interfering BIC-derived RNA) vectors generate siRNAs from a RNA polymerase II transcribed synthetic microRNA precursor based on the miR-155 microRNA precursor present in the BIC non-coding RNA (Chung et al., 2006). Three siRNAs, POSH1, POSH2, or POSH6, each targeting a different sequence in the POSH 3' untranslated region (UTR), were expressed in the CS2+SIBR vector.\n\nThe POSH1 and POSH2 siRNAs also were expressed in a single transcription unit in the same vector (POSH1+2). The control RNAi vector expresses an siRNA targeting luciferase. To test the effectiveness of the siRNAs at reducing the endogenous levels of POSH, we performed western blot analysis on extracts from mouse P19 cells transiently transfected with control, CS2+SIBR POSH1, CS2+SIBR POSH2, CS2+SIBR POSH 1+2 or CS2+SIBR POSH6 RNAi expression vectors and biCS5puro/GFP (puromycin/green fluorescent protein). The inclusion of the biCS5puro/GFP vector permitted the selection of the transiently transfected population using puromycin (Vojtek et al., 2003;Yu et al., 2003). siRNAs against POSH were effective at reducing the endogenous level of POSH protein (Figure 1A).\n\nTo investigate the role of endogenous POSH during neuronal differentiation, we introduced an expression vector for the neural basic helix-loop-helix protein (bHLH) Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) into uncommitted P19 cells together with CS2+SIBR vectors that express POSH siRNAs or a control expression vector. In addition, the cells were co-transfected with a vector that expresses GFP, allowing the transfected cell population to be readily identified. P19 cells are uncommitted mouse embryonal carcinoma cells that undergo neuronal differentiation after treatment with retinoic acid or after introduction of a neural bHLH protein (McBurney, 1993;Farah et al., 2000). Ngn1 (Figure 1B-D, F) or Ngn2 (Figure 1E) transfected P19 cells adopted a neuronal morphology and expressed neuronal markers of differentiation, including neuronal ฮฒtubulin (Figure 1B-D, F) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Figure 1E). Neurons transfected with the POSH6 RNAi expression vector exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in average process length compared to control cells (Figure 1 B-C). In addition, POSH6 RNAi resulted in an increase in the number of neurons with long processes and a corresponding decrease in the number of neurons with short processes: 73% of POSH6 RNAi neurons had process lengths of 250 ฮผm or greater compared to 7% in the control; whereas, 5% of POSH6 RNAi neurons had process lengths of 50-149 ฮผm compared to 62% in the control (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained with additional siRNAs directed against different sequences in the POSH mRNA: POSH 1+2 (Figure 1E) and POSH 7 (data not shown). In Figure 1E, neurons were generated with a second bHLH protein, Ngn1. POSH 1+2 RNAi had similar effects on process outgrowth in P19 neurons generated with Ngn 1, as observed for Ngn2. In addition to using DNA vectors, we also tested synthetic siRNA duplexes directed against POSH.\n\nNeurons derived from cells cotransfected with Ngn2 and POSH6 synthetic 22-nt siRNA duplexes exhibited increased axon lengths compared to neurons derived from P19 cells transfected with Ngn2 and luciferase (Luc) control synthetic 22-nt siRNA duplexes (Figure 1F). Reduction of POSH function specifically enhances process length; the number of processes per cell is not altered in POSH RNAi neurons (average number of processes per cell: 1.41+/-0.56 P19 control neurons; 1.42 +/-0.54 POSH6 RNAi neurons). Collectively, these results, as well as POSH RNAi complementation studies described below, indicate that increased process length in neurons transfected with POSH siRNAs specifically reflects inhibition of endogenous POSH. To determine the role of POSH in process outgrowth in primary neurons, siRNA expression vectors targeting POSH were introduced into differentiating cortical neurons isolated from E14.5 mouse embryos. UI4 GFP SIBR Luc RNAi control and UI4 GFP SIBR POSH 6 RNAi expression vectors were introduced by nucleofection into the primary cortical neurons in vitro. The UI4 vectors express a single vector derived transcript for both RNAi and GFP expression under control of the UbiquitinC RNA polymerase II promoter (Chung et al., 2006). Four days after nucleofection and dissociation into monolayer culture, process outgrowth was analyzed in GFP-labeled cortical neurons. As observed for P19 neurons, POSH RNAi decreased the number of primary cortical neurons with short axons and increased the number of neurons with long axons: 27% POSH RNAi neurons had axon lengths greater than 250 ฮผm in contrast to 4% Luc RNAi control neurons (Figure 2A, B). Dendrite length was similar in control and POSH RNAi neurons (24.6 ฮผm control, 23.2 ฮผm POSH RNAi).\n\nEarlier studies report a pro-apoptotic role for POSH (Tapon et al., 1998;Xu et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005;Xu et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2006). If POSH or other pro-apoptotic proteins limit process outgrowth by an apoptotic mechanism, then blocking the function of the apoptotic proteins with z-VAD-FMK, an inhibitor of apoptosis-inducing caspases, should lead to enhanced process outgrowth. However, the addition of z-VAD-FMK does not increase process length in P19 neurons, indicating that programmed cell death is not limiting process outgrowth (Figure 3A). In addition, the number of apoptotic cells was determined in control RNAi and POSH RNAi P19 cells, using indirect immunofluorescence to detect anti-caspase 3 positive cells. POSH RNAi resulted in a 2-fold increase in apoptosis, suggesting that POSH RNAi cells are modestly prone to enhanced apoptosis rather than cell survival (Figure 3B). These observations suggest that POSH RNAi does not indirectly increase process length by enhancing cell survival.\n\nPOSH is a multi-domain protein, with an N-terminal RING domain, four Src homology 3 domains (SH3-1 to SH3-4, named in order of location in the protein, N to C), and a Rac binding domain (RBD) (Figure 4A). Complementation analysis in POSH RNAi neurons was performed to identify domains that mediate the function of POSH in process outgrowth. To facilitate complementation analysis, a vector that simultaneously allows for RNAi, complementation analysis, and marker expression from a single vector transcript was designed. The POSH6 siRNA targets 3'UTR sequences, enabling complementation by expression of the POSH coding region. In addition, in the complementation vector, an IRES driven GFP coding sequence is inserted downstream of the POSH coding sequence, allowing for expression of both POSH and GFP proteins. Vectors expressing full-length POSH or POSH mutants were co-transfected into P19 cells with Ngn2 to drive differentiation. Process outgrowth was scored 70-75 hours after transfection. Wild type POSH suppresses the POSH RNAi phenotype, shifting the process length distribution to control levels (Figure 4B). POSH mutants lacking the RING domain fail to complement, suggesting that the RING domain is required for POSH function (Figure 4B).\n\nPOSH mutants lacking SH3-4 complement the POSH RNAi phenotype, indicating that the fourth SH3 domain is not required for POSH to regulate process outgrowth (Figure 4C). In contrast, POSH mutants lacking both SH3-3 and SH3-4 fail to complement the POSH RNAi phenotype, suggesting that the third SH3 domain is required for POSH function (Figure 4C).\n\nTo gain insight into the molecular mechanism of POSH function, we identified POSH interacting proteins, using a yeast two-hybrid approach (Vojtek et al., 1993;Vojtek and Hollenberg, 1995). Multiple overlapping clones of the F-actin binding protein Shroom3 were identified. We identified 5 isolates that encode amino acids 300 to 422 of Shroom3 and 2 isolates that encode amino acids 295-444 of Shroom3 (Figure 5A). The overlap among the two-hybrid isolates identifies amino acids 300 to 422 of Shroom3 as being the minimal POSH binding domain (PBD). This domain is evolutionarily conserved and is present in both Shroom3 isoforms, Shroom3L (L, long) and Shroom3S (S, short). Shroom3L contains an amino terminal PDZ domain that Shroom3S lacks. The region of Shroom3 identified in the screen has not previously been assigned a function; this region is located upstream of the F-actin binding domain in Shroom3L and Shroom3S and downstream of the PDZ domain in Shroom3L.\n\nTo confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, we tested the co-association of bacterially expressed and purified POSH and Shroom3 interaction domains. Histidine (His) epitope tagged Shroom3 PBD interacts with GST-POSH SH3-3 (amino acids 447-550) (Figure 5B), indicating that the two proteins directly interact in vitro. To determine if endogenous POSH and Shroom3 co-associate, Shroom3 was immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from embryonic day 16.5 mouse brains or from IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. POSH was detected in the Shroom3\n\nimmunoprecipitates by western analysis after SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that endogenous Shroom3 and POSH co-associate (Figure 5C).\n\nBecause POSH and Shroom3 co-associate, we reasoned that Shroom3 might mediate, at least in part, the actions of POSH on process outgrowth. To determine if Shroom3 regulates process outgrowth in a manner similar to POSH, siRNA expression vectors targeting Shroom3\n\n(Figure 6A) were introduced into cortical neurons isolated from E14.5 mouse embryos.\n\nCS2+SIBR control, CS2+SIBR POSH 1+2, and CS2+SIBR Shroom3 expression vectors were introduced by nucleofection into the primary cortical neurons in vitro, together with a GFP expression vector to label the transfected cells. CS2+SIBR Shroom3-3 expresses an siRNA targeting the Shroom3 3' UTR. Three and four days after nucleofection and dissociation into monolayer culture, process outgrowth was analyzed in GFP-labeled neurons. Shroom3 RNAi increased the number of neurons with long axons and correspondingly decreased the number of neurons with short axons (Figure 6B). By day 4, 82% of Shroom3 RNAi neurons had axon lengths of 250 ฮผm or greater compared to 38% of control RNAi neurons. 1% of Shroom3 RNAi neurons had axon lengths of 50-149 ฮผm compared to 18% of control RNAi neurons. Similar effects on process length were observed with a second Shroom3 siRNA expression vector (data not shown). Like Shroom RNAi, on day 4, 4% of POSH RNAi neurons had short axons, 50-149 ฮผm in length, compared to 18% of control RNAi neurons, whereas 76% of the POSH RNAi neurons had axon lengths of 250 ฮผm or greater compared to 38% in the control (Figure 6B).\n\nProcess length changes were observed on both day 3 and day 4, with day 4 exhibiting a further increase in average process length, as expected if process outgrowth is the measured parameter in this assay (Figure 6C). The observation that RNAi-mediated inhibition of either POSH or Shroom3 leads to a dramatic increase in axon length, together with the observation that POSH and Shroom3 co-immunoprecipitate from embryonic brain extracts, supports a key role for the POSH-Shroom3 complex in regulating axonal morphogenesis.\n\nShroom3 has been previously reported to regulate apical constriction. Regulation of this cell shape change requires the ASD1/actin binding domain and the ASD2/myosin regulatory domain. To determine if apical constriction and inhibition of process outgrowth have similar or distinct requirements for the Shroom3 functional domains, we assessed the requirement for each of the Shroom3 domains during process outgrowth inhibition. To test for a requirement for the Shroom3 actin binding domain, we ectopically expressed this domain (Shrm ABD 754-952) in primary cortical neurons. In Xenopus, ectopic expression of the Shroom3 actin binding domain acts in a dominant negative fashion and inhibits Shroom3 induced actin accumulation, hingepoint formation, and neural tube closure in Xenopus embryos (Haigo et al., 2003). Ectopic expression of the Shroom3 F-actin binding domain decreased the number of neurons with short axons and increased the number of neurons with long axons (Figure 7A), suggesting that Shroom3's ability to negatively regulate axon outgrowth is coupled to its ability to bind F-actin.\n\nTo test for a requirement for the Shroom3 ASD2 domain, an RNAi complementation assay in primary cortical neurons was utilized. Shroom3-3, a specific Shroom3 RNAi construct, targets 3'UTR sequences, enabling complementation by expression of the Shroom3 coding region.\n\nExpression of Shoom3S, the short version of Shroom3 that lacks the PDZ domain present in ShroomL, complements the Shroom RNAi phenotype whereas expression of Shroom3ฮASD2, a Shroom3 protein, lacking the ASD2 domain, fails to complement (Figure 7B). These observations suggest that the PDZ domain is not required for Shroom3 function in process outgrowth inhibition and support a role for the Shroom3 ASD2 domain in process outgrowth inhibition.\n\nRecent studies suggest that Shroom3 recruits ROCK to regulate apical constriction.\n\nROCK binds the Shroom3 ASD2 domain through amino acids 698-957, denoted RI-CI (Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). Ectopic expression of RI-CI acts in a dominant negative fashion to block apical constriction, by blocking the ability of endogenous ROCK to bind Shroom3 (Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). To determine if ROCK functions with Shroom3 to inhibit process outgrowth, P19s were transfected with RI-CI and its effects on process length assessed. Process length is enhanced in RI-CI expressing neurons relative to control, suggesting that Shroom3 acts through ROCK to inhibit process outgrowth (Figure 8). Inhibition of ROCK with the pharmacological inhibitor Y27632 enhances neuronal process outgrowth in control neurons (2.2-fold), consistent with previous studies that demonstrate a role for ROCK as an inhibitor of axon outgrowth and regeneration after injury. Addition of the ROCK inhibitor enhances process outgrowth in RI-CI expressing neurons and in POSH RNAi neurons, 1.37-fold and 1.45 fold, respectively, but the enhancement of process outgrowth is attenuated relative to control neurons (Figure 8). The observation that the enhancement of outgrowth in RI-CI expressing neurons and POSH RNAi neurons is attenuated relative to control suggests that ROCK regulates process length in both a POSH-Shroom dependent and independent manner.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that Shroom, by localizing ROCK, regulates myosin II distribution and/or activity to promote apical constriction (Hildebrand, 2005;Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). Myosin II has been implicated as a key player in process outgrowth through its ability to regulate process extension, retraction, adhesion and detachment (Wylie and Chantler, 2001;Brown and Bridgman, 2003;Chantler and Wylie, 2003;Medeiros et al., 2006;Even-Ram et al., 2007;Ketschek et al., 2007). Therefore, RNAi was used to determine if a reduction of myosin II function would alter POSH RNAi or Shroom RNAi process length relative to control cortical neurons. Reduction of myosin IIA by RNAi altered process length in POSH RNAi neurons: 23% POSH RNAi neurons had processes 250 ฮผm or greater in length whereas 10% neurons deficient in both POSH and myosin IIA function had processes 250 ฮผm or greater (p<0.0012) (Figure 9A). The ability of myosin IIA inhibition to suppress or reverse the POSH RNAi phenotype is independent of plating conditions, as similar results were observed when neurons were grown on poly-L-lysine (data not shown) or poly-L-lysine and laminin. MyosinIIA\n\nRNAi also altered process length in Shroom RNAi neurons: 23% Shroom RNAi neurons had processes 250 ฮผm or greater in length whereas 4% neurons deficient in both Shroom and myosin IIA function had processes 250 ฮผm or greater (p<0.0012) (Figure 9B). Reduction of myosin IIA by RNAi had no effect on process length of Luc RNAi control neurons (Figure 9A, B).\n\nRNAi neurons, preventing an assessment of the role of myosin IIB as an effector of POSH function. To confirm the involvement of myosin II activity, primary cortical neurons were treated for two hours with blebbistatin, a pharmacological inhibitor of myosin II (Kovacs et al., 2004), and process length was measured at the end of the two hour window. Blebbistatin treated POSH RNAi neurons exhibited a decrease in process length relative to DMSO (vehicle control) treated POSH RNAi neurons: 25% POSH RNAi DMSO treated cortical neurons have processes 250 ฮผm or greater in length whereas 11% POSH RNAi blebbistatin-treated neurons deficient in myosin II activity had processes 250 ฮผm or greater (p<0.003) (Figure 9C). Average process length of POSH RNAi neurons decreased by approximately 50 ฮผm in two hours; since POSH RNAi neurons extend at an estimated rate of 5 ฮผm/hr, blebbistatin promoted retraction or decreased adherence is likely to contribute to this substantial decrease in process length, in addition to inhibition of process outgrowth.\n\nRobo and EphrinB2 are components of inhibitory pathways that negatively regulate process outgrowth (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996;Huber et al., 2003). RNAi mediated decrease in Robo or EphrinB2 function led to enhanced process outgrowth in P19 neurons (Figure 10), consistent with their roles as negative regulators of process outgrowth. We assessed whether myosin IIA RNAi could reverse enhanced process outgrowth phenotypes resulting from RNAi-mediated inhibition of either Robo or EphrinB2 function. In contrast to POSH and Shroom, myosin IIA RNAi did not reverse the Robo RNAi or EphrinB2 RNAi phenotypes.\n\nThese observations, together with the observation that myosin IIA RNAi does not inhibit process outgrowth of cells transfected with control vectors, indicate that myosin IIA RNAi does not simply function as a general suppressor of process outgrowth, but instead it specifically reverses the effects of POSH and Shroom3 RNAi. Collectively, these results suggest that upregulation of myosin IIA function may be the driving force behind the increase in length in neurons deficient in POSH or Shroom function.\n\nThe POSH scaffold protein is expressed in the mouse central nervous system during embryonic development. Here, we demonstrate a role for POSH in regulating neuronal process outgrowth. P19 neurons with RNAi mediated inhibition of POSH exhibit an increase in process length. Likewise, RNAi reduction of POSH function in embryonic primary cortical neurons leads to an increase in axon length. Collectively, these observations support a role for POSH in negatively regulating process outgrowth.\n\nAlthough previous studies have reported that POSH promotes apoptosis in various cell types, including mature neurons (Tapon et al., 1998;Xu et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005;Xu et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2006), increased process length in the differentiating POSH RNAi neurons is not due to enhanced survival resulting from the loss of a pro-apoptotic protein. First, the percentage of apoptotic cells was modestly increased with POSH RNAi, not decreased as expected if POSH RNAi enhanced cell survival in differentiating neurons. Second, pharmacological inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspases did not increase process length under the experimental conditions employed here. How POSH regulates these two distinct biological processes remains to be discovered, but one possibility is that the ability of POSH to function in one pathway or another is a consequence of different partners bound to POSH.\n\nPOSH is comprised of multiple protein interaction domains. Complementation analysis supports a role for the third SH3 domain of POSH in regulating process length, and we show that the SH3-3 domain of POSH binds Shroom3. We also report a requirement for the POSH RING domain, a characteristic feature of a subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Membrane trafficking, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and process outgrowth inhibition each require the RING domain of POSH, suggesting a conserved function for this domain (Alroy et al., 2005;Tsuda et al., 2005;Kim et al., 2006;Tuvia et al., 2007). POSH interacts with JNK pathway signaling components (Tapon et al., 1998;Xu et al., 2003), the AKT serine threonine kinase (Figueroa et al., 2003;Lyons et al., 2007), and the small GTPase Rac (Tapon et al., 1998), all are known regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics; however, their contribution to POSH-mediated process outgrowth regulation remains to be determined.\n\nWe identified Shroom3, an F-actin binding protein that regulates apical constriction through a myosin II dependent pathway (Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999;Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005), as a POSH interacting partner using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We screened a high complexity library (5-10 million clones) and recovered multiple overlapping Shroom3\n\nisolates. In addition, when this same high complexity library was screened for Shroom3 interacting partners, we recovered POSH (C. Figueroa and A. B. Vojtek, unpublished observations). POSH and Shroom3 are expressed in overlapping regions of the developing brain.\n\nFurther, we demonstrate that endogenous POSH and Shroom3 co-associate during embryonic neural development, suggesting that complex formation between these two proteins may have functional consequences. Finally, we show that primary cortical neurons deficient in Shroom3 function exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to the POSH RNAi neurons, namely, exuberant axon outgrowth. Taken together, the biochemical and molecular genetic studies reported here suggest that POSH and Shroom3 work in concert to negatively regulate axon outgrowth.\n\nShroom3 requires the function of the ASD1 and ASD2 domains for process outgrowth inhibition. The ASD1 domain is thought to function as a localization domain, to link Shroom3 to the actin cytoskeleton (Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005;Dietz et al., 2006). The ASD2 domain regulates myosin II activity and/or localization, likely by recruiting ROCK (Rho kinase) (Hildebrand, 2005;Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). Consistent with a proposed role for myosin function, we demonstrate that RNAi mediated inhibition of myosin IIA or blebbistatin-mediated inhibition of myosin II activity reverses the POSH and Shroom3 RNAi phenotypes. This result suggests that increased myosin II activity may be the driving force behind the increase in length in the POSH or Shroom3 RNAi phenotypes. The POSH-Shroom3 complex is likely to act through ROCK, which binds the ASD2 domain of Shroom3. Consistent with this, we show that ectopic expression of the domain of ROCK that binds Shroom3, which functions as a dominant negative by blocking the association of endogenous ROCK with the Shroom3 ASD2 domain (Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008), increases process length. ROCK regulates myosin II activity by phosphorylating myosin light chain and myosin light chain phosphatase (Riento and Ridley, 2003). The POSH-Shroom3 complex, by regulating ROCK function, may regulate myosin II.\n\nAlternately, POSH may not directly regulate myosin IIA activity; rather, a reduction of myosin IIA function may compensate for a shift in balance among cytoskeletal forces engendered by a reduction in POSH or Shroom3 function. Such a shift in balance among cytoskeletal forces also could be mediated by ROCK, which regulates multiple effector pathways (Riento and Ridley, 2003;Gallo, 2006). In addition to regulating myosin activity, ROCK phosphorylates LIM kinase, which regulates actin filament assembly, and CRMP2, which regulates microtubule assembly, among other effector proteins (Riento and Ridley, 2003). Loss of ROCK function in one specific complex, perhaps reducing signals through a particular effector pathway, could shift the balance among cytoskeletal forces. Understanding in greater detail which substrates ROCK phosphorylates when associated with the POSH complex will likely provide additional insight into the mechanism by which POSH and Shroom3 inhibit process outgrowth and further define the role of myosin IIA in this process.\n\nPOSH inhibits process outgrowth through the actomyosin regulatory protein Shroom3.\n\nPOSH also regulates membrane trafficking and calcium homeostasis (Alroy et al., 2005;Kim et al., 2006;Tuvia et al., 2007). The interplay between the actomyosin network, membrane trafficking, calcium signaling events and inhibition of process outgrowth remain to be determined. POSH may regulate process outgrowth through its ability to regulate membrane trafficking and/or calcium homeostasis, in addition to regulating the actomyosin network.\n\nAlternately, POSH by regulating the actomyosin network may indirectly regulate membrane trafficking and/or calcium levels.\n\nPrevious studies demonstrate that Shroom3 regulates apical constriction and that two conserved domains, the ASD1/actin binding domain and the ASD2 domains, are each required for Shroom3 to promote apical constriction (Haigo et al., 2003;Hildebrand, 2005;Dietz et al., 2006;Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008). Process outgrowth inhibition also requires these two conserved domains of Shroom3. Thus, two distinct cell shape changes have similar requirements for Shroom3. Intriguingly, myosin II activity is required for Shroom3-promoted apical constriction whereas repression of myosin II activity appears to be required for POSH-Shroom3mediated inhibition of process outgrowth. As discussed above, repression of myosin II activity may be direct or indirect, with Rho kinase a likely key player. A further distinguishing characteristic of the two cell shape changes is a requirement for different Ras family members. In Xenopus, disruption of Rap1 signaling blocks Shroom3-mediated apical constriction (Haigo et al., 2003) whereas Rac is linked to POSH (Tapon et al., 1998;Figueroa et al., 2003;Xu et al., 2003). Together, these results highlight the role that scaffold protein dependent signaling events play in mediating specific biological outcomes.\n\nCollectively, the results presented here suggest that the molecular scaffold protein POSH assembles an inhibitory complex that links, directly or indirectly, to the actin-myosin network to regulate neuronal process outgrowth. Also, these findings reveal a role for Shroom3 in axon outgrowth, in addition to its previously described role in apical constriction. As a negative regulator of process outgrowth, the POSH-Shroom3 complex may represent a useful target to overcome neurite outgrowth inhibition. A. Inhibition of endogenous POSH by POSH siRNAs. Extracts were prepared from puromycin selected P19 cells transiently transfected with POSH or control SIBR siRNA expression vectors and a GFP/puromycin expression vector. POSH1, POSH2 and POSH6 RNAi vectors express a single siRNA directed against a unique sequence in POSH. POSH1+2 expresses both POSH1 and POSH2 siRNAs from a single transcript. The RNAi control vector expresses an siRNA that targets luciferase; targeting luciferase has no functional consequences in P19 cells and this serves  POSH RNAi expression vectors were introduced into cortical primary neurons prepared from E14.5 mouse embryos by nucleofection. In the UI4 vectors, a single vector derived transcript mediates both RNAi and GFP marker expression. Nucleofected cells were plated to lamininpoly-L-lysine coated dishes and neurons were fixed and stained for GFP to enhance signal strength 72 hours after nucleofection. Photographs of neurons were captured with a digital camera and the length of the longest process per cell measured. A. Representative images depicting the change in axon length between control and POSH RNAi neurons 72 hrs post-nucleofection. B. The average process length of POSH RNAi primary cortical neurons is enhanced relative to control (*, p<0.043 Student's t-test). C. Neurons were also classified on the basis of axon length: the majority of control neurons have short processes (50-149 ฮผm), whereas the population of neurons with long axons (250+ ฮผm) was increased with POSH RNAi (p<0.0002, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). A. Inhibition of cell death with z-VAD-FMK has little effect on process length of P19 control neurons. P19 cells were transfected with Ngn2 and control GFP expression vectors. Transfected An irrelevant goat polyclonal antibody was used as a specificity control (Ctrl). Following SDS-PAGE, western blot analysis was used to detect Shroom3 and co-associated POSH. A. RNAi-mediated reduction of Shroom3. Extracts were prepared from puromycin selected P19 cells transiently transfected with Shroom3 or control RNAi expression vectors and a GFP/puromycin expression vector. Shrm3-3 targets a sequence in the 3' UTR region of Shroom3, and is effective in reducing endogenous Shroom3 expression. Endogenous Shroom was detected in extracts by western blotting with an anti-Shroom3 antibody (upper panel). Western blotting for actin, loading control (lower panel). B., C. RNAi-mediated reduction of Shroom3 enhances axon outgrowth of primary cortical neurons. Control, POSH1+2, or Shrm3-3 RNAi expression vectors were introduced into cortical primary neurons prepared from E14.5 mouse embryos by nucleofection; a GFP expression vector was included to identify the transfected cells. Process length was measured on fixed, stained GFP-labeled neurons 3 and 4 days after nucleofection. B. Shroom3 RNAi increases the % neurons with long processes relative to control (p<0.0002, two-tailed Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). C. Shroom3 RNAi also increases the average process length relative to control neurons (*, p<0.0001, Student's t-test)."
