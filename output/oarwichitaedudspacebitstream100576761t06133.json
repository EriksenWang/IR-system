These materials are usually constituted to obtain properties that cannot be achieved by any of the components acting alone.\n\nThe increasing requirements for stiff light weight structures, especially in the aerospace, automobile and marine industries has led to a great increase in the use of fiber reinforced composite materials, as they have a high strength-to-weight ratio and specific stiffness when compared to metals. In aircrafts, composite joints are rapidly replacing fasteners and rivets which are generally employed in aircraft structures. Despite of the advantages possessed by composite materials, they do have some limitations such as susceptibility to damage brought on by lowvelocity impacts with various objects such as hail, bird strikes, runway and taxiway rubble or even dropping of tools during manufacture. These limitations are especially acute in regions where individual composite components are joined together by fasteners, riveted joints or by adhesive joints as joints are areas prone to strength reduction. In the present age of improving fuel efficiency without compromising on the strength of structure, adhesive joint proves to be a forerunner compared with riveted joints or fasteners. Of the various advantages possessed by adhesive joint over other forms of joints, adhesive bonding increases the strength of the joint as stresses are evenly distributed because of larger surface area of contact. This being the case, the response of joints especially the most prevalent form of composite joints -the adhesive joint to low velocity impact should be understood in detail before incorporating these composites into aircraft structures.\n\nImpact tests are very difficult to understand because of numerous parameters which play an important role in an impact event. Degree of complexity of an impact event on fiber reinforced composites is higher because of the heterogeneous behavior as well as anisotropic nature of composite materials and also due to the complex failure modes that can occur.\n\nUnderstanding the process of impact damage initiation and growth and identifying the governing parameters are important for designing impact resistant structures and for developing improved material systems. The objective of this research is to study the response of adhesive joints in various fiber reinforced composite panels to low velocity impact for different energy levels, and various impactor diameters and for different materials based on impact energy, damage area and residual indentation. This being so, some of the primary areas of interest for this study are as noted below:\n\n• Impact Testing\n\n• Failure modes in low -velocity impact damage\n\n• Experimental Methods for assessing damage CHAPTER 2\n\nAn adhesive can be defined as a material which when applied to surface materials can join them together and resist separation. Although, adhesives have been used by humans for thousands of years in their drive to make objects stronger and more useful, it is hard to quote a single moment when their usefulness was first discovered. Instead, use of adhesives is likely to have been a gradual process. As commented by Alexander (1923), 'the real glue and gelatin industry emerged about the beginning of the nineteenth century'. In these early days of industrialization, quality control was almost non existent in glue factories and the final products available for use were of varying quality and performance. Involvement of scientific discipline to glue industry made possible the much required documentation of available knowledge regarding glue manufacture as well as the testing results. By the beginning of 20 th century, testing of manufactured glue products not only did influence the performance and quality of the glues but it greatly influenced the market value of the glue. The development of test methods during the early 20 th century paved way for many of the test methods in use for assessing uncured adhesives as well as the strength and durability of the adhesive joints.\n\nThe creation of epoxy resins could be considered as the single most important landmark in the history of structural adhesives. Epoxy based adhesives was successfully employed in aerospace, automotive, construction, electronic and woodworking applications largely because of their ease of use, versatility and mechanical properties. Epoxy adhesives possess high shear strength but relatively low toughness and peel strength. Adhesives can be classified in the manner in which they harden. Common ways in which adhesives harden are either by loss of solvent, loss of water, cooling or chemical reaction. Crosslinking of the polymers happen during hardening which usually happens in structural adhesives [1].\n\nJoint design is dependent on the nature of materials to be joined as well as the method of joining. The load bearing structural adhesive joint can be considered relatively new, about half a century old. A structural adhesive is provides major strength and stiffness for the structure preventing the joint from separation under load. Joints could be obtained either by fastening the surfaces by either by mechanical fastening methods or by using adhesive bonding. Various factors are to be considered while using adhesive bonding for joints such as whether the structure need to be dismantled for repair, maintenance or inspection, how the assembly is affected, and in what environment is the assembly going to function which are a few major factors to be considered while using adhesive bonding. As dismantling and reassembling of adhesively bonded structures is almost impossible with such structures it's always economical as well as effective to use adhesive bonding for subassemblies which could be designed as throw away parts which does not require dismantling.\n\nUtilization of adhesive joints depends on the development of structural materials especially in aerospace industry as bonded joints are present vastly in that industry. Adhesive bonding is advantageous compared to mechanical joining as the former as they have higher fatigue and corrosion resistance together with superior strength when thin sheets of materials are bonded together. Bolts or rivets could be considered as points of high stress concentration that can lead to structures having lower static and fatigue strengths than an adhesive bonded system.\n\nOn the darker side, adhesive bonded joints require extensive surface preparation as well as they have poor resistance to environmental degradation. As for composite materials surface preparation requirements are minimal, such joints are more feasible in composite materials.\n\nDesign of bonded joints is an iterative process which involves stress analysis, suitable failure criteria, environmental effects and manufacturing process for determining suitable joint configuration and materials [6]. Typical joint configurations are shown below in Figure 1. The single lap joint could be considered as one of the most common 'plate-to-plate' joint designs employed in the industry as its easy and cheap to manufacture. When it comes to inspection of the joint, it's the most convenient one for inspection as complete inspection can be made from one side of the joint. Under tension this joint poses a problem which is often used to demonstrate the accuracy of theories for calculating the stresses in adhesively bonded joints.\n\nAshcroft et al. [7] investigated the effects that environment and fatigue loading have on the performance of bonded composite joints. Studies were mainly concentrated on the environmental effects -both prior to and after bonding. It was concluded from their investigation that temperature and humidity have a considerable effect on the mechanical performance and the nature of failure process. From their investigation, it can be comprehended that at higher temperatures, the strength of short overlap joints is controlled by the yielding and flow behavior of the adhesive rather than by its fracture resistance. It is also inferred from their work that moisture contained prior to bonding resulted in formation of voids in the bondline which results in the strength of the joint. An interesting observation from their research work is that upon drying a substantial proportion of initial strength could be regained which indicated that plasticization of the composite matrix or adhesive because of moisture is a reversible process.\n\nMechanically fastened components can sometimes show fretting due to very small amplitude relative movement normal to their mating surfaces when vibration is transmitted through the joints. Adhesive bonding can serve to damp or attenuate the vibration and also it can eliminate the fretting. Vibration could also loosen the bolted assemblies. To prevent this, thread locking adhesives are used for prevention [2].\n\nImpact resistance is the study of damage induced by foreign object impact in a laminate and the factors affecting it. An understanding of impact damage development, the failure modes involved, and the various factors affecting damage size can be gained only through extensive experimental studies. Of the different techniques discussed in the literature, some were nondestructive and others are destructive. To simulate actual impact by a foreign object, a number of test procedures have been suggested. Special consideration is given for initial kinetic energy of the projectile as it is an important parameter to be considered but several other factors also affect the response of the structure. Abrate [4] quotes that a large mass with low initial velocity may not cause the same amount of damage as a smaller mass with higher velocity even if the kinetic energies are exactly the same. In one case, the impact might induce an overall response of the structure, while in the other the response might be localized in a small region surrounding the point of impact. Hence it can be inferred from the experiments conducted by the author that appropriate test procedure selected so as to ensure that the test conditions are similar to the impact conditions to be experienced b y the actual structure.\n\nExperimental studies attempt to replicate the actual situations under controlled conditions. Many procedures have been contrived to assess the impact performance of adhesively bonded joints because of the wide variety of applications. The various methods used for quantify the impact behavior are provided in the succeeding section.\n\nIn a pendulum test, a small block is adhered to a larger block which is fixed to the base of the testing machine and an impact load is applied to the small block due to the collision of the pendulum hammer. At impact, the joint is subjected to high rate shear loading and is fractured.\n\nImpact energy absorbed by the joint specimens can be calculated from the difference of the pendulum height between the initial position before the test and its maximum height after the collision [1].\n\nDrop weight testers are extensively used and can be off differing designs. Heavy impactors are usually guided by a rail during their free fall from a given height. Usually a sensor activates a mechanical device designed to prevent multiple impacts after the impactor bounces back [1]\n\nPendulum tests and drop-weight tests are ineffective in achieving high strain rates.\n\nIn-order to achieve higher strain rates, i.e., strain rate of 10 2 /s -10 3 /s, usually Split Hopkinson bar technique is often used. Using Split Hopkinson bar technique strain rate of 10 2 /s -10 3 /s can be realized easily and using special experimental setups higher strain rates upto 10 4 /s could be obtained. Typical Hopkinson bar equipment is used for impact compression tests; it has two steel bars which are the input bars and output bars between which a specimen is inserted. A striker, which is accelerated usually with a gas gun, collides with the end of the input bar to cause a stress wave in the bar and the wave reaches and transmits the specimen as an impact load [1].\n\nDuring aircraft take off and landing, debris flying from the runway can cause damage;\n\nthis situation with small high velocity projectiles is best simulated using a gas gun. Another concern is the impact of a composite structure by a larger projectile at low velocity which occurs when tools are accidentally dropped on a structure. This situation is best simulated using a drop weight tester [4] During the impact by a spherical projectile, the stress distribution under the impactor is truly three dimensional. As soon as the projectile enters in contact with the target, a compressive wave a shear wave and surface waves propagate away from the impact point. For low velocity impacts, no significant damage is introduced during the early stage of the impact. That is stress levels remain low as these waves travel many times through the thickness of the laminate and then the target deforms like a plate. Damage is introduced when overall bending motion is established. With higher velocity impacts, the compressive wave after reflection from the back surface can generate tensile stresses of sufficient magnitudes to create failure near the back face [4].\n\nFeraboli et al. [9] showed that peak force cannot be always considered as a criterion to compare impact events. They have quoted that peak force should not always be used to for assessing damage maps. They also found out that there is a critical value of impact force for damage initiation which is independent of impact energy. An experimental database is generated through drop tower impact testing of an undeformable striker on clamped circular plates, for a particular composite material with a particular layup sequence and laminate thickness. From these experiments conducted, they have concluded that critical force rather than peak force should be used to characterize damage resistance of composite structures.\n\nBelingardi and Vadori [13] [18] studied the low velocity impact behaviour of carbon fiber-epoxy matrix laminates using drop dart tests. Composite laminates of two different stacking sequences, different laminate thicknesses were tested both by quasi-static and dynamic impact loading. It can be found out from their research that as expected the global energy absorption increases as the number of layers increase. Degree of damage was the most relevant parameter in this study. It could be seen that there exists a trend in damage degree with respect to specific impact energy. The damage degree is increasing until the saturation of the material. The force versus displacement curves shows that the values of first damage force and maximum force values remain substantially constant with impact energy which implies that these parameters depend on the laminate thickness.\n\nFarrow et al. [16] conducted study on the effect impact on adhesively bonded single lap composite joints. Low velocity impacts were conducted at very low energy levels so that the damage made on the joint is barely visible. Results show that in the top laminate, delamination occurs at the interface between 0 0 layer and 45 0 and 90 0 layers. In the adhesive, cracks at 45 0 indicate typical shear failure. In the bottom laminate, delamination between layer interfaces exists but increase through the depth at an increasing rate compared to that in the top laminate.\n\nThe authors comments on the adhesive-laminate interface during the tensile testing. It was found that the interfaces were intact in all specimens after failure which suggests that the joint failure maybe due to the adherends and not due to the adhesive.\n\nAmbur and Kemmerly [19] conducted an experimental study on the effect of the impactor mass on the low-speed impact response of laminated flat composite plates. It has been\n\nshown from the available test data that the compression strength of composite structures can be significantly reduced by the damage induced by low -velocity impact. 48-ply-thick quasiisotropic flat plate test specimens were used for their experimental study. Energy levels varied from 7.5 ft-lbs to 25 ft-lbs and the impactor weights ranging from 2.5 to 20.0 lbs and an impactor diameter of 0.5-inch was used for the study. As the Impact energy increases due to the damage initiation, there is reduction in the contact force and respectively there is a change in the damage modes in the specimens. It is also found that with increase in mass of the impactor results in a reduction in the damage area.\n\nHosur et al. [20] conducted a study on the impact response of woven fabric laminates manufactured by affordable VARIM process under low velocity impact loading. Plain and satin weave graphite fabric laminates were used for the experiments and impact tests were conducted with energies ranging from 5 to 40 J. Ultrasonic C-Scan techniques was used for the non destructive examination of the damage induced on the specimens. Regarding the failure mechanisms, its different in woven fabric composites as compared to unidirectional laminates. It has been observed that 8-harness stain weave fabric laminates showed better impact resistance through higher peak loads, higher stiffness and lower damage area.\n\nImpact on fiber reinforced composite laminates can be characterized with parameters such as impact energy, impact force. Evaluating the impact behavior using those parameters would not be complete without finding out the damage induced in the fiber reinforced composite laminates. Damage measurement in composites can classified as non-destructive testing and destructive testing. During an impact event, the damage is internal and generally consists of delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breakage. This makes it very difficult of measure the damage as surface examination cannot tell completely about the damage induced in the laminate.\n\nNon destructive testing is now an essential part of quality assurance in many areas such as manufacturing industry, construction industry, process or quality control, maintenance and also in medical industry too. The basic principle of non-destructive testing is very straightforward -to determine the quality or integrity of an item non destructively, find a physical phenomenon that will interact with and be influenced by the test specimen without altering the specimen's function. The basic guidelines in choosing an NDT method is by understanding the physical nature of the material property or discontinuity o the material to be inspected, understanding the physical nature of the interaction of the probing field with the test material as well as considering the economic, environmental as well as regulatory factors [5]. All non destructive testing methods are based on physical principles. Basic principle of nondestructive testing is subjecting the specimen being examined to some form of external energy source and analyzing the detected response signal. Non destructive testing relies completely on the full understanding of the response of materials to different types of external stimuli and on the ability to analyze the response signal compared to the predicted theoretical behaviour. The different types of non-destructive testing methods which are used for various purposes such as research, maintenance are described below [5].\n\nPenetrant testing is a very simple and a sensitive non destructive testing method. Rather than being simple, this method is an inexpensive as well as a quick method for inspection of a large variety of component parts and materials for discontinuities that are open to the surface.\n\nBasic principle of penetrant testing is the ability of the penetrant fluid to coat the specimen completely, and then to penetrate the depths of the discontinuities open to the surface. For detection of the defects using this method, the indicator material must be visible. Hence proper illumination is required for efficient use of this method. This method of testing is advantageous in many aspects, could be utilized in various industries, convenient portability of equipments for testing, could be used irrespective of the size and shape of the specimens to be tested. The handicap of this test is that it requires an experienced inspector and also this test can detect only\n\ndefects that are open to the surface of the specimen [5]\n\nNon-destructive testing using ultrasonic could be considered as the most widely used methods used in industry. Ultrasonic waves are high frequency sound waves which vibrate at a frequency above 20,000 Hz. In ultrasonic inspection, a transducer transforms a voltage pulse into an ultrasonic pulse. A transducer transmits the pulse into the test object and the pulse travels through the object with respect to the geometry and mechanical properties. The coming through the specimen is then transmitted to another transducer or reflected back to the original transducer. In both methods, the signal is transformed back into an electrical pulse which can be observed in an oscilloscope. Based on the signal, presence of a flaw, defect or delamination and its size, shape, position and composition could be detected without much difficulty. Nondestructive testing using ultrasonic find innumerable applications in the aircraft, semiconductor as well as medical industries. Ultrasonic methods are advantageous as it could be used to test complex geometries irrespective of materials. It could be used for metals to ceramics to biological materials. Ultrasonic methods offer contacting as well as non contacting approaches.\n\nLike all non destructive testing methods, this method also requires experienced personnel for effective use of the method. In all cases, ultrasonic methods require the transducer to be in contact with the object through water or a gel-coupling layer. Capability to reveal planar flaws is almost absent in ultrasonic waves [5].\n\nMagnetic particle inspection is one of the most economical for detecting defects in a ferromagnetic material. In this method, the sample is magnetized and simultaneously finely divided ferromagnetic particles are flown over the surface. Any defects in the materials will affect the magnetic field in the sample and which will attract magnetic particles to the edges of the defects. MPI is simple to operate as well as to interpret, reliable for finding surface cracks, it could detect the defect even if the defect is filled with some foreign body such as thin coats of paint or plating. MPI is limited to ferromagnetic parts and also it can detect only surface or near surface cracks [5].\n\nAcoustic emission is a passive monitoring method, in which acoustic energy released by the material or the structure is monitored while the structure is under load. The initiation or propagation of damage mechanisms produce acoustic waves which help in detection as well as assessment of damage mechanisms. Acoustic emission can be defined as the release of transient elastic waves produced by a rapid distribution of stress in a material. Measurement of AE waveforms depends on the generation of the waveform at the source, propagation and measurement. Acoustic emission is a vastly developing technique which is finding application in various areas. This method finds its major application is damage activity monitoring, detecting damage location, identifying the damage mechanism as well as strength predictions. Using an array of sensors, arrival times of the acoustic emission at different sensor locations combined with the acoustic wave speed help to identify the position of the source. Once the damage area is detected, other non destructive testing methods can be utilized to find out the severity of the damage. Attempts have been made to estimate the residual strength of a structure using Acoustic emission method. Such a calculation is difficult as there is no physical link existing between strength and acoustic emission as all non destructive testing uses some physical phenomena to bring out results [5].\n\nActive thermography uses infrared imaging with the help of external heating to evaluate subsurface structure. It makes use of the thermal response of the sample. Active thermography focuses on the detection of subsurface structures and defects utilizing the variation in thermal properties between the defect and the host material. Active thermography uses an infrared camera which allows images of the surface temperature distribution of a sample to be taken in video rates. In this method, sample to be tested is heated with a modulated light source and the temperature distribution is recorded with the infrared camera as a function of time [5].\n\nVarious other methods of non destructive testing used for the evaluation of damage are using microwaves and optical techniques such as holographic interferomety, speckle techniques and photoelastic techniques.\n\nDestructive techniques include sectioning of several strips of material at different locations and orientations throughout the impacted zone. These strips are then mounted in epoxy resin and ground on successively finer abrasive silicon carbide paper. After that each strips are examined carefully under microscope to construct detailed maps of delaminations at each interface and of matrix cracks in each ply.\n\nComposite joint, which is the main area of interest in this study, was fabricated using woven glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy plain weave fabric and carbon/epoxy unidirectional tape adherends and the adhesive used for bonding of these adherends is Hysol EA 9394 which is an epoxy paste adhesive. Material selection and adhesive selection was carried out by taking into consideration of an actual joint which is employed in industry. Utmost care was taken in the selection of materials as well as adhesive as these could be said as the major factors which play a very important role in the whole investigation Woven glass/epoxy adherend was used to simulate the joints which exists in small aircrafts as well as used in marine applications. As this material is translucent, visual observation of the internal damage is also possible.\n\nMaterials which were selected for this study were in the form of prepregs which is an abbreviated usage for fibers impregnated with resin. Basic information regarding the materials which were used for this study is listed in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1 BASIC PREPREG INFORMATION MANUFACTURER FIBER PRODUCT ID RESIN PRODUCT ID MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION NEWPORT 7781 NB 321 E-GLASS/ EPOXY WOVEN TORAY T700G-12K-PW 3900-2 CARBON/ EPOXY PLAIN WEAVE FABRIC TORAY T800S 3900-2B CARBON/EPOXY UNIDIRECTIONAL TAPE\n\nAfter material selection, layup sequence for the laminates as well as the specimen geometry has to be taken care of. Severity of the damage that is going to be induced in the composite laminate during impact loading as well as thickness of the specimen decides the layup sequence. In order to have sufficient strength for the joint, in this experimental study, quasi isotropic layup sequence is employed. Composite laminates were fabricated using hand layup and cured in autoclave in accordance with the cure cycle mentioned by the manufacturer.\n\nGlass adherend used for the experiment study is Newport NB 321 with style 7781 woven fiber glass. Newport 321 is a 250°F to 300°F cure, toughened, high T g , controlled flow epoxy resin system. High T g and excellent mechanical properties make it an ideal product for general aviation as well as aviation market. Layup details of the prepreg and the cure cycle for the glass adherend used for this experimental study is as given below in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2 GLASS/EPOXY ADHEREND LAYUP SEQUENCE MATERIAL LAYUP SEQUENCE NOMINAL THICKNESS GLASS/EPOXY FABRIC [0/45/90/-45] S 0.09175\n\nThe cure cycle for glass adherend is as follows:\n\n• Heat the part to 270±10° F at a rate of 6° F per minute based upon the part thermocouple reading. The part must reach 270±10° F in 60 to 180 minutes.\n\n• Hold at 270±10° F for 100±10 minutes. The hold period begins when the lowest part thermocouple reaches 260° F.\n\n• Cool the part to below 170°F at a rate of 5° F per minute as measured on the part thermocouple while maintaining full vacuum.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the cure cycle for glass/epoxy adherend used for the experimental study.\n\nCarbon unitape adherend used for the experimental study was Toray T800S-3900-2B.\n\nLayup details of the prepreg and the cure cycle for the carbon/epoxy unidirectional tape adherend for this experimental study is as given below in Table 3. The cure cycle for carbon plain weave adherend is as follows:\n\n• Apply the temperature ramp from ambient to 270 ± 10 °F at a rate of 3.0 ± 1.0°F per minute.\n\n• Maintain the cure temperature at 270 ± 10 °F for 120 ~ 150 minutes.\n\n• Cool down the temperature to 170 °F or lower at a rate of 4.5 ± 0.5 °F per minute before removing the vacuum. experimental study.\n\nCarbon/epoxy plain weave adherend used for the experiment study is T700SC-12K-50C/#2510, which is a high strength standard modulus fiber with excellent processing characteristics.\n\nLayup details of the prepreg and the cure cycle for the carbon/epoxy plain weave fabric adherend for this experimental study is as given below in Table 4. The cure cycle for carbon/epoxy plain weave adherend is as follows:\n\n• Apply the temperature ramp from ambient to 270 ± 10 °F at a rate of 3.0 ± 1.0°F per minute.\n\n• Maintain the cure temperature at 270 ± 10 °F for 120 ~ 150 minutes.\n\n• Cool down the temperature to 170 °F or lower at a rate of 4.5 ± 0.5 °F per minute before removing vacuum experimental study.\n\nAdhesive selection was based on industry standards. Hysol EA 9394, which is a product of Henkel Corporation, widely used by aviation industry, was used for bonding of composite laminates. The selected adhesive is a two part structural adhesive which cures at room temperature and possesses excellent strength to 350°F/177°C and higher. Its thixotropic nature and excellent high temperature compressive strength also make it ideal for potting, filling and liquid shim applications. Besides these properties, this adhesive has long pot life, low toxicity and good gap filling capabilities which makes it a suitable adhesive for the research work which was carried on.\n\nAfter selecting the right adhesive for bonding purpose, next step in specimen fabrication is to determine bondline thickness for the joint as well as the bonding method. Bondline thickness selected for the purpose was 0.007\".Such a thinner bondline thickness was selected because it was observed from references as well as from many trial runs conducted that thinner the bondline thickness is more the joint strength. Superior strength of the joint with a thinner bondline thickness is mainly due to the probability to have lesser chance of void formation in between the adherends and the adhesive layer.\n\nBonding was done by applying pressure on the adherends using clamps for fabrication of the joint. Hysol EA 9394 was applied on the trimmed composite panels as per instructed by the manufacturer. Adhesive is applied on one of the adherends to the specified bondline thickness and the other adherend is wetted using the same adhesive. The clamped specimens were then taken into an oven for curing. Accelerated curing was employed for bonding. As per the adhesive manufacturer, Hysol EA 9394 can be either cured for 3 to 5 days at 77°F or can be cured for 1hour at 150°F to achieve normal performance\n\nThe bonding procedure is as follows:\n\n• Adherends were covered with utility tapes leaving the bonding area\n\n• Part A and Part B of the adhesive were mixed at 100% to 17% ratio and stirred vigorously\n\n• Spacers of thickness 0.007\" were bonded to adherends using M-Bond 200 adhesive to control thickness of adhesive layer.\n\n• Mixed paste adhesive is applied on one of the adherends and the other adherend is wetted using the same adhesive to control formation of voids , thus ensuring formation of an effective joint.\n\n• The adherends are then placed on aluminum plates and clamped using C clamps manually\n\n• After clamping, the adherends are taken to oven for curing.\n\nThe cure cycle for Hysol EA 9394 is as follows:\n\n• Ramp up to 160°F from room temperature at a rate of 5°F per minute in 15 minutes\n\n• After reaching 160°F in 15 min, the temperature is maintained for 60 mintues\n\n• After 60 minutes, it is again cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5°F per minute in 15 minutes\n\nWhile manufacturing a component using metals, it can be said that we start with the material in its final form even though some heat treatment processes may be essential to improve the properties of those metals. But when it comes to composite materials, they are made at the same time as the structure. Composite laminates for specimen fabrication for the experimental study was manufactured using vacuum bagging procedure and cured in an autoclave.\n\nVacuum bagging procedure is universal for any kind of structure. Prepregs are laid on a tool which usually made of aluminum. Before laying up the prepregs which form the laminate later on after curing, the tool is coated with a release agent. After coating with release agent, peel ply is laid on the tool. Peel plies are a tightly woven fabric, often nylon, and impregnated with some type of release agent. Peel plies often gives the texture for the composite laminate. Usually peel ply with rough finish is used as it helps in obtaining a better bonding while adhesives are used for bonding purpose. Next step in vacuum bagging is to apply a bag sealant tape along the sides of the tool. Bag sealant tape is a putty-like material which comes in rolls, usually 1/2 inch wide, with a release paper on one side. After peel ply is laid on the tool, prepregs are stacked up in the correct stack up sequence. After stacking up the prepregs a caul sheet covered with peel ply is placed on top of the prepregs. On top of the caul sheet, a layer of breather cloth is placed.\n\nBreather is a thick, felt-like cloth which helps to absorb excess resin. It also provides a Vacuum ports are placed with utmost care so that there are not leaks on the sides of the port.\n\nPrepregs which are laid using this procedure are then taken to an autoclave and cured under required pressure and temperature conditions as directed by the composite manufacturer.\n\nFigure 5 shows the schematic representation of vacuum bagging stackup sequence. Hand sanding is used for surface preparation because of the specimen dimension.\n\nSandblaster machines have a tendency to take off more material from the specimen surface than desired which is not desirable for this research. Composite panels are manufactured in autoclave to 18 inch by 18 inch in dimension out of glass fiber and carbon fiber prepregs. These cured composite panels are then trimmed to 17 inch by 17 inch in dimension for maintaining the perpendicularity as well as parallelism of the specimens and also to remove the extra resin which gets deposited on the sides during curing. These trimmed panels were then again milled down to two panels of dimension 6 inch by 17 inch as shown in Figure 7. The specimen surfaces were at first degreased using acetone. After drying off the acetone, the surfaces are roughened using a sand paper of grade 220 and after that those surfaces were subjected to water break testing. The roughened surface has to pass through water break testing. Water break testing is a means to check for discontinuity in the specimen surfaces which are sanded. If there is any discontinuity in the flow of water over the sanded surface, the specimens does not pass the water break test. If such discontinuities are present, those surfaces are to be cleaned with acetone and then roughened using sandpaper of the same grade until a continuous water flow is obtained which indicates that the specimen roughness is even all over the surface and it is ready for bonding.\n\nComposite laminates were bonded together to form a single lap joint. Lap joint was considered as the most suitable joint for this experimental study because of the ease of fabrication as well as the effectiveness to simulate an impact event occurring at joints in aircraft structures. Lap joint is one of the most commonly occurring joints and is the configuration often employed for adhesive testing.\n\nAdherend dimensions were determined in accordance with ASTM D7136 standard.\n\nASTM D7136 describes the test method for measuring the damage resistance of a fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite to a drop weight impact event. As described in the above said standard, adherend size for the test coupon was 4\" × 6\". Currently there is no specific standard available which says about the test coupon configuration for impact testing of an adhesively bonded lap joint, it was decided to follow ASTM D7136 to determine the adherend dimensions and overlap area for the lap joint was set to 3\".Brass spaces of 0.007\" were used during fabrication process of the test coupons to control bond line thickness. Figure 6. shows the specimen geometry and dimensions of the test coupons used for impact testing.\n\nComposite panels which were trimmed down to 17\" × 6\" using a milling machine which uses a diamond coated blade was used for manufacture test coupons of dimensions 4\"×6\".\n\nFigure 7a. illustrates the panel trimming operation done on the adherend panels used for the experimental study. After roughening the bond area on panels of above said dimension, brass spaces of thickness 0.007\" were placed on locations as shown in Figure 7b. Hysol EA 9394 is mixed as per manufacturer specifications and is uniformly spread over the overlap area.\n\nAdherends are then clamped down together using C-clamps and taken to an over for curing as per adhesive cure cycle mentioned earlier in this section. After curing, those panels are machined to test coupon dimensions as mentioned above.\n\nData points required for generating force displacement curves, impact force history and total energy history were obtained from impact testing done on the test coupons using an Instron Dynatup 8250 drop weight tester. Table 5 shows the test matrix for experimental study.\n\nAdherends made up of three material systems were used for the experimental study. The test coupons were impacted using impactors of three different impactor diameters. The test coupons were impacted at different energy levels for each impactor diameter.\n\nTABLE 5 TEST MATRIX FOR IMPACT TESTING MATERIAL IMPACTOR DIAMETER [in] ENERGY LEVEL [J] NO:OF SPECIMENS 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 10 25 40 0.50 0.75 1.00 NEWPORT NB321 TORAY T800SC UNITAPE TORAY T700 12K PALIN WEAVE 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.50 TOTAL NO: OF SPECIMENS 72 0.75 1.00\n\nImpact testing was done on a total of 72 test coupons. Because of the vast number of coupons to be tested for the experimental study a common naming nomenclature was employed for identifying the specimens. All the test coupons were named based on the nomenclature as shown in Table 6.\n\nTABLE 6 SPECIMEN NOMENCLATURE Event Adhesive Adherend Panel# Impactor Dia Energy Level Specimen # I Impact 1 EA 9394 G NEWPORT NB321 1 1 1\" A 10 Specimen 1 U TORAY T800SC 2 2 0.75\" B 25 Specimen 2 P TORAY T700 12K 3 3 0.5\" C 40 Specimen 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nImpact loading was done on the adhesively jointed composite coupons for the experimental study using a Instron Dynatup 8250 Drop Weight Impact Tester. This machine is equipped with a pneumatic rebound catch mechanism and data acquisition software which runs on a computer connected to the drop weight impact tester. Data from Instron Dynatup 8250 Drop Weight Impact Tester is acquired with Instron Dynatup Model 930-I data acquisition system. This following section describes mainly about the impact testing machine and the impact testing procedure.\n\nInstron Dynatup 8250 Drop Tower consists of the following features:\n\n• Two guide columns Figure 12 shows the experimental setup used for experimental study.   This fixture is provided with dowel pins which makes helps in aligning the test coupon at the correct position. Clamps provided on this fixture are used to clamp down the test coupon which prevents movement of the test coupon. Usually coupons of size 4\" × 6\" are impacted using this kind of test fixture. Another kind of test fixture available for impacting of the test coupons is shown in Figure 10. This fixture comprises of two aluminum or steel plates with each plate containing an opening in the middle which enables to impact the test section on that coupon. One of these plates is provided with dowel pins which enable to align the test coupon at the correct position. These plates are clamped down to the test stand using four screws from the test stand at the four corners of the test fixture.\n\nDuring an impact event, the impactor usually bounces due to the impact on the specimen.\n\nIn order to prevent the impactor from inflicting secondary impacts on the specimen, a pneumatic rebound-catch mechanism is employed. Rebound catch mechanism for Instron Dynatup 8250\n\nDrop Tower consists of a shock absorber and a stop block setup. Shock absorber setup consists of two air cylinders located close to the guide columns. The piston for those air cylinders are activated by compressed air. The end of the piston which comes in contact with the dropweight assembly is made up of elastomeric material which helps to prevent damage for the dropweight assembly.\n\nDuring an impact event, forces will be applied on the test coupon typically for an interval of 0 to 10 milliseconds as shown in Figure 13. All the required data which has to be extracted from the experiment has to be recorded in such a small time interval. For that purpose, a system which is capable of capturing the data effectively should be employed. Data acquisition should be done only during the time of impact in order to keep the amount of data to the minimum. In order to do that, an automatic triggering device should be also present in the test machine which initiates data acquisition at the right time.\n\nInstron Dynatup 8250 Drop tower is equipped with Instron Dynatup Impulse data acquisition system which could be termed as the heart of the impact testing machine. Impulse data acquisition system is a combination of both hardware and software components. It comprises an instrumented tup, the Impulse data acquisition software, the Impulse signal conditioning unit (ISCU), and one of a range of National Instruments data acquisition cards.\n\nAmong the hardware components which comprise the data acquisition setup of the test machine, photo-detector/flag system which provides impact velocity information plays a vital role and particular notice should be given to the role which it plays in the whole testing.\n\nPhoto-detector/flag system which detects the velocity of impact comprises of a velocity detector flag which is mounted on the drop weight assembly and a velocity detector block mounted close to the path of the drop weight assembly. Velocity detector block incorporates a photo electric sensor which has an emitter and a receiver, in which the emitter produces a non-pulsating infrared beam. The gap present in between the emitter and the receiver provides the path for the velocity detector flag which during the impact testing interrupts the infrared beam. As a result of this interruption of the infrared beam, a voltage pulse is produced. This voltage pulse is used to trigger the data acquisition as well as to measure the impact velocity.  Adhesively bonded composite joints were impacted at the center of the overlap region using Instron Dynatup 8250 Drop Weight Tester which was described in detail in the above section. The test coupons were impacted over a range of impact energies as well as using impactors of varying diameters. The range of impact energies used for the experimental study was from 10J to 40 J and the diameter range of the impactors were from 0.5″ to 1.0″. Data reported from an impact test are force time history, displacement time history, velocity time history and energy time history. The following section describes basic procedure for impact testing.\n\nBefore performing an impact test, velocity detector has to be positioned at the correct height. If the velocity detector block is not positioned at the right position, all the data acquired from the impact test will not be accurate. The following steps have to be followed while setting up the velocity detector.\n\n1. Place the specimen on the desired support fixture 2. Lower the crosshead until the tup rests on the specimen 3. Loosen the two screws that attach the velocity detector to its support bracket 4. Slide the velocity detector up or down until the edge of interest of the velocity detector flag is approximately 0.25″ below the center line of the velocity detector.\n\n5. Check that the flag passes through the center of the velocity detector slot 6. Secure the velocity detector to the support bracket\n\nAfter setting up velocity detector block successfully, a velocity test has to be conducted.\n\nVelocity test is conducted for the following reasons:\n\n• Establish a height for the drop weight that will give the required velocity\n\n• To find out what velocity is being achieved at the current drop height.\n\n• Confirm that the value that you have set as the target velocity for the dropweight is actually being achieved.\n\nBelow given procedure has to be followed while running a velocity test: b. After inputting all the required information in above said window, when Next is clicked, another window opens up where all the test coupon tracking information is entered and in the following window all the test coupon information has to be entered.\n\nc. After inputting all these preliminary information, specimen is placed on the support fixtures d. By hitting Next, machine is ready to run impact test.\n\ne. Using control pendant, the drop weight is made to fall under gravity by pressing the fire button.\n\nf. After impacting is done, software generates force time graphs and energy time graphs.\n\nNon-destructive testing is now an essential part of quality assurance, to determine the quality or integrity of an item non -destructively, find a physical phenomenon that will interact with and be influenced by the test specimen without altering the specimen's function. Damage due to an impact event may be cracking of the matrix, fiber breakage, debonding which occurs internally within the specimen. Matrix cracking as well as fiber breakage can be quantified visually but debonding cannot be quantified using visual inspection. In order to assess damage caused due to debonding, non destructive testing using through transmission ultrasonic C-scan inspection is carried out. In this experimental study, SDI 5000 Series Ultrasonic system is used for C-scan inspection of the impacted test coupons. The following section describes about the details of the equipment used for non-destructive inspection as well as the through transmission ultrasonic C-scanning procedure followed for non destructive inspection of impacted test coupons. This chapter also discusses briefly about the residual indentation measurement procedure.\n\nSDI 5000 Series Ultrasonic system which is an ultrasonic immersion inspection system is being used for a wide variety of applications. An ultrasonic system is said to be comprised of three main components:\n\n• Mechanical Scanner Mechanism\n\n• Motion Control Hardware and Software\n\n• Flaw Detector\n\n• Data acquisition hardware and software A typical ultrasonic inspection system is shown in Figure 14. Above said components were the three main categories in which the components of an ultrasonic system could be included. On a broader classification, such systems consist of the following components:\n\n• Immersion tank\n\n• Bridge (X,Y,Z axes)\n\n• Gimballs (A,B)\n\n• Servo box\n\n• Recirculation pump, water filter and skimmer\n\n• Motion control software and hardware\n\n• Ultrasonic transducers\n\n• Flaw Detector\n\n• Data acquisition software and hardware\n\nThrough transmission ultrasonic C-scan method was used to obtain the planar damage of the impacted test coupons. This kind of non-destructive testing procedure involves transmission of ultrasonic waves across the specimen through transducers located on either side of the specimen and obtaining a planar damage pattern through differences in the signal attenuation levels. This equipment uses a method called pitch-catch method, in which the signal emitted by  to find out damage area induced in the test coupon. The grayscale image obtained from Cscanning is quantized into percent levels, 1 percent levels and 256 percent levels which gives a RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nBehavior of adhesively bonded composite joints to different impact energy level as well to different impactor diameters is discussed in the following section. Impact tests were done on test coupons fabricated from woven glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy plain weave fabric and carbon/epoxy unitape adherends. All the test coupons were clamped down to the test fixture as shown in Figure 10 in the previous section, with a test section of 3″ × 5″. Parameters which were used to quantify the impact response of these test coupons were maximum impact force, total energy absorbed, duration of impact and impactor displacement.\n\nFigure 18 to Figure 26 show the typical force displacement, impact force-time and energy time plots for test coupons impacted at 40J with impactors having impactor diameter 0.5″, 0.75″, 1.0″ respectively. Force-time history of the above said three materials with different impactor sizes are totally different. From the plots its evident that impactor with smaller diameter, 0.5″ induces more damage in the form of matrix cracking, fiber cracking which leads to penetration rather than compared with impactors with larger diameters. Impactors with larger impactor diameters induce more impact force on the test coupons primarily due to larger contact area at the point of contact. Due to the above said phenomena, the load which is applied on the test coupon gets distributed to a larger area which leads to larger internal damage. Typically, smaller diameter impactors induce damage in the form of fiber cracking; it has been observed that the internal damage area is comparatively lesser than the damage area produced by impacts due to impactors with larger diameters.\n\n0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Displacement [in] 0 500 Impact Force [lbf] Woven Glass/Epoxy [0/45/90/-45] s Impact Force : 40J 0.5\" Impactor 0.75\" Impactor 1\" Impactor Figure 18.

Damage process in composites take place as a result of matrix cracking which induce delamination in between ply interfaces. Matrix cracks are induced on the first layer at first because of high localized stresses. Further progression of the damage happens from upper to the bottom layers. This progression follows a pattern which is called as pine tree pattern. More damage area is observed in carbon fiber adherends compared to glass fiber adherends. In glass fiber adherends, as the impactor diameter increases the damage area also increases linearly. While, in carbon plain weave adherends, damage area increases and reaches a maximum and then drop down with increase in energy level. This shows that in carbon plain weave material, damage area reaches a threshold value at specific impact energy level and after that propagation of damage does not take place as at higher energy levels with a specific impactor, instead formation of highly localized stresses takes place resulting in penetration of the joint. Possible explanation for the significant difference in damage area graphs between unitape and plain weave could be because of the difference in fiber strength.\n\n1\" Impactor 40 J 0.75\" Impactor 40 J 0.5\" Impactor 40 J 1\" Impactor 40 J 0.75\" Impactor 40 J 0.5\" Impactor 40 J Figure 37.

Three different adherend materials were used for the experimental study.\n\nHysol EA 9394 was used for bonding composite laminates. Quasi-isotropic lay-up sequence was employed for the manufacture of three different adherends and all the adherends were 8 ply composite laminates. A total of 72 test coupons were impacted as well as inspected nondestructively as a part of the experimental study. All the test coupons were impacted using impactors of hemispherical cross section of having diameters 0.5″, 0.75″and 1.0″ and were impacted at 10J, 25J and 40J of impact energy.\n\nImpact test results show that for all the three different adherend materials used for this study, larger impactor diameter produced higher impact forces as compared with impactors of smaller diameter. A significant 15% difference in the impact forces is observed between test coupons impacted with impactors of 1.0\" and 0.5\" diameters. It is could be observed distinctly that each material response is totally different from one another. Even though, basic trend with respect to impact force remain the same, it could be observed that drop in impact force for different impactor diameters for different materials is more for adherends made up of carbon fiber compared with adherends made up of woven glass. It could be attributed more to the material properties of the adherends. The difference in impact force between impactors gets amplified with decrease in impactor diameter and also with increase in impact energy. Another observation made in this experimental study was the impact resistance of various materials. It was observed that for a particular impactor diameter and particular impact energy, woven glass adherends were able to withstand more impact force than adherends made up of carbon fiber.\n\nIrrespective of the adherend material, it was observed that the contact duration of impact was shorter for larger impactor diameters which were indicative of wider load distribution.\n\nAll the impacted specimens were then tested non -destructively for damage measurement. Through transmission ultrasonic C-scan method was used to quantify planar damage as well as residual indentation depth measurements were also used to quantify the damage. Both material systems showed different kind of damage states visually. In woven glass adherends, damage state observed for different impactor diameters and different energy levels visually was comparable with the damage state obtained from ultrasonic C-scanning. But in the case of carbon fiber adherends, visual the damage observed on the test coupons was not indicative of the damage state obtained through ultrasonic C-scanning. It has been observed that in glass fiber adherends, as the impactor diameter increases the damage area also increases linearly. While in carbon fiber adherends, damage area reaches a threshold value at specific impact energy level and after that propagation of damage does not take place as at higher energy levels with a specific impactor, instead formation of highly localized stresses takes place resulting in penetration of the joint. Hence forth, it can be concluded that in case of carbon fiber adherends, results obtained from visual inspection of the test coupons could be misleading and residual indentation cannot be considered as a reliable means of quantifying damage area. While comparing damage areas for woven glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy plain weave fiber and carbon unitape test coupons, it is observed that woven glass/epoxy test coupons exhibit more impact resistance. It is also observed that the damage area observed in carbon unitape test coupons were nearly twice as that observed in woven glass/epoxy coupons. Damage area observed in carbon/epoxy plain weave test coupons were nearly 10 times of that observed in woven glass/epoxy coupons.\n\nFrom the experimental studies, it was concluded that woven glass is capable of taking more impact force than carbon fiber. Hence it is recommended that while manufacturing impact prone composite structures such as bumpers in passenger cars, it would be considered effective to manufacture impact resistant composite structures from woven glass fiber or make a hybrid structure in which woven glass fiber could be used on the outer layers of the structure and carbon fibers on the inner layers. In that way such a structure could provide impact resistance as well as strength to the structure.\n\nImpact testing was done mainly at room temperature to obtain the response curves for different materials systems. It is recommended that as a part of future work, impact testing could be done on the test coupons at various environmental conditions such as hot wet, hot dry and cold wet conditions to evaluate the response of composite adhesive joints at those environmental conditions.\n\nFor this experimental study, a quasi-isotropic layup sequence was employed for the manufacture of composite joints. As a part of future work, impact testing could be done on test coupons manufactured using adherends employing different layup sequence. In addition to the above said recommendation, impact testing could also be done on adherends bonded using various types of adhesives.
