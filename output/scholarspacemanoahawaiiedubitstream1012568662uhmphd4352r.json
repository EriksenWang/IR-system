The work presented focuses on aspects of the ecology of cetaceans, primarily odontocetes, found in waters around the Island of 0'ahu.\n\nChapter I is entitled \"The Status ofOdontocetes in Hawaiian Waters\". It introduces the current status of knowledge of odontocetes in Hawai'i and is the premise for this dissertation.\n\nChapter 2 entitled \"Odontocete Strandings as an Indicator of Distribution Patterns in the Main Hawaiian Islands\" was written using information obtained from the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Area Office (NMFS-PAO) on historical strandings of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters from 1937 to 2002. A version ofthis chapter will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in collaboration with Lori Mazzuca at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Shannon\n\nAtkinson at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) and the Alaska Sea Life Center (ASLC).\n\nChapter 3 provides a review of the theory behind the distance sampling method which was used to analyze the line transect data collected during aerial surveys, and Chapter 4, entitled \"Abundance and Distribution of Cetaceans in Near-Shore Waters around 0'ahu and Penguin Banks\" presents preliminary abundance estimates for humpback whales and odontocetes found in waters within the 500m isobath around the Island of 0'ahu using the distance-sampling method. This chapter also provides Finally, a conclusion section summarizes the information presented in the other chapters. This section provides a more general understanding of the patterns that influence the distribution of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters.\n\nIn 1981 Shallenberger completed a review of the status of Hawaiian cetaceans for the u.S. Marine Mammal Commission with the objectives of (1) developing a list of all cetaceans found in Hawaiian waters, (2) reviewing the existing literature to extract those facts pertinent to the management of Hawaiian species, and (3) making recommendations\n\nas to what additional data were needed to ensure the protection and conservation of cetaceans and their habitat in Hawai'i (Shallenberger, 1981). In his final report Shallenberger writes: \" ...At present there is no species of Hawaiian cetacean for which adequate knowledge of these five topics [present and past population levels, structure and distribution, factors affecting mortality and natality, basic natural history, factors affecting the resources upon which the species depends, man's effect on the species] is available...\" .\n\nNineteen years later, Mobley et ai. (2000), for the first time, published preliminary estimates of odontocete abundance in waters within 25 nautical miles of the main Hawaiian Islands, obtained using aerial surveys flown between 1993 and 1998.\n\nSuch study was part of a comprehensive assessment of cetacean populations during the period January to April, when humpback whales are present in Hawaiian waters.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, at least 19 species of odontocetes (Table 1) have been identified in Hawai'i (Shallenberger, 1981;Nitta, 1991;Mobley et ai. 2000). However, a recent National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) stock assessment report on the status of knowledge of Hawaiian marine mammals acknowledges that there is still insufficient information on most species of odontocetes to be able to make a reliable determination of their population size, and trends in abundance and distribution (Carretta et al., 2001).\n\nThe Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) was instituted on 4 November 1992 to specifically protect humpback whale habitat, and monitor key population parameters (National Marine Fisheries Service, 1991). The focus of sanctuary-funded research on a single species may not be an ideal approach, given the incompleteness of information available on cetaceans as a whole in Hawaiian waters. In fact, many in the scientific community advocate that the health of an ecosystem is directly dependent upon the health of all its parts, and further agree that an ecosystem-based approach is the most appropriate strategy for long-term management (Christensen, 1996;Noss, 1996;Schwartz, 1999;Sherman and Duda, 1999).\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative to emphasize the importance of adopting a broad research and monitoring plan for Hawaiian waters, which includes multiple species of cetaceans and their prey.\n\nOdontocetes share key areas of concern with humpback whales and often interact with them at multiple levels. In addition, most Hawaiian odontocete species are found in Hawaii' year-round, and are, therefore, intimately tied to the local oceanographic and biological cycles. Odontocetes sit at the top levels of the marine food chain, and may more directly suffer the cumulative effects of harmful substances present in their habitat, or of major shifts in food availability, making them a sensitive indicator of general ecosystem health (DeMaster et al., 2001;Benson and Trites, 2002). Many other factors may influence their spatial and temporal distribution, including anthropogenic factors (Harwood, 2001).\n\nIt has been true in the past history of species management that interest in a particular species only peaked at the onset of large documented declines in population levels, and, often, population parameters before the decline were not available. It is clear that this approach is problematic.\n\nBecause there is insufficient information on odontocete populations in Hawaiian waters we cannot assume these populations are doing well. Furthermore, if there is a concern that humpback whale populations may be affected by increasing human-related activities in Hawai'i, then we should be equally concerned about some of the same activities affecting odontocetes which reside year-round in these waters.\n\nMany factors may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of odontocetes, including physiographic and hydrographic characteristics, prey distribution, breeding and calving areas, predation and anthropogenic factors (Payne et al., 1986;Richardson et al., 1995;Baumgartner, 1997;Davis et al., 1998;Davis et al., 2002). How any ofthese factors influence distribution of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters is poorly known. Davis et al. (2002) suggested that cetacean distribution may primarily be explained by prey availability, and, secondarily, by hydrographic features. In addition, the distribution and movement patterns of one species may be related to the distribution and movement patterns of another because of affiliation or competition for resources. For example, schools of spinner dolphins are frequently found in association with spotted dolphins and have been documented to feed in large aggregations across the Pacific Ocean (Leatherwood et al., 1988). Feeding aggregations often include many levels of the trophic chain, and predator-prey relationships can, therefore, be quite complex. Heithaus (2001) reports a significant dietary overlap between sharks and dolphins. The presence of sharks as potential competitors, and, at times, as predators, may affect the short-term distribution of some species.  8 Shallenberger (1981).\n\n• Mobley et al. (2000) reported odontocetes sighted during aerial surveys conducted within 25 nautical miles off the main Hawaiian Islands between 1993-1998. (*) Sightings were classified as Kogia sp. and could have been either pygmy or dwarf sperm whales. Mobley et al. (200 I) reported killer whale sightings in Hawaiian waters (three historical reports besides the sighting reported by the authors). Shallenberger (1981) reported that a significant portion of the diet of Hawaiian odontocetes consists of epipelagic and mesopelagic fish and squid. This primarily includes myctophid fish, some of which migrate at night to between near surface and 400 m depth of the surface (Reid et al., 1991;Benoit-Bird et al., 2001) and several species of squid, including Abralia trigmura and Abralia astrostica, which also show vertical diurnal migrations (Shallenberger, 1981). The mesopelagic boundary community is an important factor in shaping the foraging strategy and distribution of odontocete predators, which face physiological limitations and cost-benefit tradeoffs when accessing this resource at depth versus near the surface. Because the availability of the mesopelagic boundary layer changes throughout the night, until, during daylight hours, the layer is too deep (400-700 m) for effective foraging by most odontocetes, these predators may have to limit their foraging to nighttime, and, more precisely, to specific times during the diel cycle when the prey is available closer to the surface or at a depth that maximizes intake and minimizes physiological costs (Benoit-Bird, 2003). This has been studied in spinner dolphins in Hawai'i, which track both vertical and horizontal movements of the shallower mesopelagic boundary prey layer between dusk and dawn (Benoit-Bird, 2003). Many odontocetes also feed on the locally abundant opelu (Decapterus pinnulatus and Decapterus maruadsi) and akule (Trachurops crumenophthalmus) may also be particularly important in smaller odontocetes' diets, while larger odontocetes have been observed eating mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) (Shallenberger, 1981). Around the Hawaiian Islands these are the same resources that are important to fisheries. Because movements of odontocetes may be closely tied to movements of commercially important prey species, an understanding of seasonal and diel patterns in abundance and distribution of odontocetes could reveal more subtle patterns in the distribution of economically important resources.\n\nOf the eight Hawaiian Islands, O'ahu is by far the most heavily impacted by human related activities, housing approximately 80% ofthe state's population and being visited by over five million tourists per year (Hawaii Tourism Authority, 2002). On O'ahu, whale and dolphin watching are increasingly becoming popular activities and some hotels on the island have started advertising \"swim with the dolphins\" locations where wild spinner dolphins are known to come close to shore to rest. Long-standing local fisheries target fishes that are also prey to one or more species of odontocetes, and numerous anecdotal reports ofadverse interactions between fishermen, bottlenose dolphins and false killer whales have been collected (Nitta and Henderson, 1993). Habitat degradation, in the form of pollution, depletion of resources by fisheries and humanrelated activities, noise, and increase in human presence on the water, can also negatively impact marine mammals (Harwood, 2001).\n\nOverlaid on the natural cycles are, therefore, a variety of anthropogenic factors with the potential to influence or alter the abundance and distribution patterns of species sharing all or portions of their preferred habitats with humans. For the Hawaiian Islands, and O'ahu in particular, increasing development on land, and increased use ofthe marine environment for a variety of economic reasons, dictates that the status of all marine resources be assessed before insurmountable problems present themselves. It is therefore a priority to develop management plans based on the sustainable use of waters surrounding the Island of 0'ahu, with particular attention to all federally protected marine mammals.\n\nBased on these premises, the present study was undertaken to complete a preliminary assessment of the status of odontocetes around 0'ahu. The general objectives of the present work were: (1) to present historical information available on Hawaiian odontocetes and discern, from it, general patterns of distribution, (2) to supplement historical information for O'ahu with a field study of abundance and distribution patterns using aerial survey techniques, and (3) and to discuss some of the natural factors that may drive abundance and distribution of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters.\n\nBaumgartner, M.F.

Strandings (Shallenberger, 1981;Nitta, 1991;Mazzuca et al., 1998 and1999), historical records (Tomich, 1986;Shallenberger, 1981), opportunistic sightings (Shallenberger, 1981), and dedicated surveys (Mobley et al., 2000) have helped identify the 19 species of odontocetes, which are currently known to occur in this area The patterns of abundance and distribution have been recently documented for the winter and spring of 1993-1998(Mobley et al., 2000)), while no studies report about year-round patterns. Until routine scientific monitoring of abundance and distribution patterns of cetaceans is undertaken, strandings documented in the Hawaiian Islands will be a useful resource to fill knowledge gaps.\n\nA few cetacean species have been documented only from stranded specimen (Klinowska, 1985;Goodall, 1977;Mignucci-Giannoni et al., 1999;Pinedo and Polacheck, 1999;Malakoff, 2001). Strandings have been used to provide an indication of distribution for some commonly occurring species and help identify areas of occurrence in regions where systematic scientific effort is lacking (Guerra-Correa et al., 1987).\n\nBecause of the rugged topography and low population levels in some parts of Hawai'i, the Hawaiian Islands are not an ideal location to maintain an efficient stranding network (Nitta, 1987). However, strandings have been documented since 1937. Nitta (1991) summarized stranding data between 1937and 1987, and Mazzuca et al. (1999) analyzed odontocete mass stranding data between 1954 and 1997. However, a complete analysis of odontocete stranding patterns for Hawaiian waters has not been done. The purpose of this study is to summarize the currently available stranding information and deduce generalized patterns of distribution for odontocetes in waters surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThe Hawaiian Island Archipelago is isolated from any other landmass by approximately 4,600 kIn of deep oceanic water. It consists of a group of volcanic islands including eight major islands and 124 islets, stretching in a 1,500-kilometer crescent from Kure Atoll in the northwest to the island of Hawai'i in the southeast, encompassing an area of 16,729 square kIn (Fig. 1). ..\n\nHaWaj'j. Northeast trade winds prevail most of the year. Wind patterns may affect the probability of a carcass being washed ashore. In addition, the islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Shallow reefs can alter the pattern of stranding by preventing carcasses from reaching the shore. Thus, the location of these features may be important when interpreting the patterns of stranding.\n\nStranding information for the period 1937-2002 around the Island ofO'ahu was obtained from the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Area Office (NMFS-PAO)\n\nand from previously published work (Shallenberger, 1981;Nitta, 1991;Mazzuca et al., 1999).\n\nStranding reports contained in the NMFS-PAO database reported stranding date, species involved when identifiable, stranding location, number of animals stranded, and name of the responders. Some reports also included gender, estimated age class and status of the carcass, disposition information and samples taken. The database also included reports from news articles and phone calls, and not all carcasses were checked by NMFS-PAO personnel. Ancillary information was provided when available.\n\nDifferences in stranding frequency by species, island, sector (each representing a different compass direction as outlined below), and season for all main Hawaiian Islands were investigated. To determine if the distribution ofstrandings was skewed toward a particular compass direction, each island was divided into eight wedge-shaped sectors (NNE, ENE, ESE, SSE, SSW, WSW, WNW, NNW; Fig. 2). The length of the coastline delimited by each sector was calculated (in kilometers) using a measuring tool included in the ArcView 3.2© software package. Number of strandings per kilometer of coastline were calculated for each compass direction for each of five islands/regions (Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Maui/Lana'i, Hawai'i). Comparisons among islands and sectors were accomplished using two-way ANOVA. Species composition in the stranding record for all main Hawaiian islands was compared to that obtained by Mobley et al. (2000) during aerial surveys of the main Hawaiian Islands within 25 nautical miles from shore, and to that obtained during aerial survey transects conducted around the island between 1998 and 2000 (Maldini, Chapter 4 ofthis dissertation). Data for O'ahu were analyzed in details with respect to location and species composition since O'ahu's database was more comprehensive than for all other islands.\n\n•••••••wsw•~:;-;.:,,.,,::• / .~./~ssw / ./ .........

Access to Nihi'a'u shores is limited to native Hawaiians, while Kaho'olawe is uninhabited. Strandings for Maui and Lana'i were combined because of the small number ofstrandings recorded on Lana'i (two records).\n\nOne-hundred and eighty-seven odontocete strandings were recorded in the main Hawaiian Island region by the NMFS-PAO between 1937 and 2002. Of these, 174 were identifiable to species, seven to genus (six Kogia sp. and one Stenella sp.), two were unresolved identifications, and 10 were unidentified (Table 1). The trend in the data was best explained by a second order polynomial regression (R=0.411; P<O.OOl), and it predicted an increase in the number of strandings throughout the history of the database (1937-2002;Fig. 3). 1 2 . . . , . . . --------------------, f'-l . 5 10 Sixteen species were included in the stranding record, although pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf sperm whale (Kogia simus) were pooled as Kogia sp.\n\nfor analysis purposes (Table 1). The four most common species in the stranding record were Kogia sp. (18%; with pygmy sperm whale being more common), spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris; 15%), striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba; 12%), and spenn whale (Physeter macrocephalus; 10%; Fig. 4).\n\nTable 1 -List of odontocete strandings recorded by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Area Office between 1937 and 2002 in the main Hawaiian Islands.

The difference in number of strandings per month was not significant (Kruskal-Wallis: H=17.873; P=0.085). Strandings on 0'ahu occurred along all four main coastlines: north shore, Waianae or west coast, south shore, and windward coast (Fig. 8). Two species (spinner dolphin, and melon headed whale occurred on all four coastlines (Table 2). The false killer whale was localized, stranding only in a small geographical area between the Mokapu Peninsula and Kailua on the windward coastline (four events; Table 2 and 3).\n\nAll but one stranding of Kogia sp. occurred along the windward coast ofO'ahu (five out of six events; Table 2). Sperm whale strandings were concentrated around Kahuku Point between north shore and windward coastline (Table 3). Patterns for all other species were difficult to interpret (Table 2).  Multiple strandings occurred in localized areas such as Moku1e'i'a and Hale'iwa along the north shore, Kahuku, Punalu'u, Kane'ohe, and Kailua along the windward coast, and Makaha and Nanakuli along the Waianae coast (Fig. 8; Table 3).\n\n* one of the strandings could not be identified to species\n\nFifteen of the 16 species reported in the stranding record for the main Hawaiian Islands were also reported by Mobley et al. (2000) and Mobley et al. (2001) during aerial surveys of the region. Seven of the 13 species reported through strandings throughout the main Hawaiian Islands (and six of those reported for O'ahu) were also detected during aerial transects around 0'ahu between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 9). Based on the stranding record, Kogia sp., melon-headed whales, striped dolphins and dwarfkiller whale appear to be more common than suggested by aerial surveys (Fig. 9; Table 4).\n\nConversely, pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins were more common, according to aerial surveys, than predicted by the stranding data (Fig. 9; Table 4).  Following is a summary of the main findings by species listed in order of frequency of occurrence in the stranding record:\n\nKogia stranded 31 times (32 individuals), including 11 live strandings, a neonate, a calf, and a female with a calf. Twenty-two strandings were confirmed to be the pygmy sperm whale, four were confirmed to be the dwarf sperm whale, while the remaining strandings were not identified to species. Of the 15 sexed animals eight were males and seven were females. Kogia stranded on all main Hawaiian Islands, with 14 strandings on Maui, seven on 0'ahu, four on Kaua'i, three on Moloka'i, two on Hawai'i, and one on Lana'i. All but one of the strandings on 0'ahu and all strandings on Moloka'i occurred\n\nEight strandings (32 individuals) occurred, with three mass strandings on Maui and one on O'ahu (Mazzuca et ai., 1999). The Maui events occurred in 1976 (two live on 27 and 28 June and a single freshly dead animal on 30 June) suggesting these were related events. Because 12 animals were assisted off the beach on the first mass stranding, it is possible that some of the subsequent strandings were the same animals (Mazzuca et ai., 1999).\n\nOfthe individuals sexed (12), six were males and six were females.\n\nThe roughtoothed dolphin was first reported in the stranding record in 1969 and stranded at intervals of5.80 (SE=1.47) years. Spotted Dolphin: Stenella attenuata Spotted dolphins stranded eight times (one alive) and only on O'ahu. Four were females and three were males. Two of animals, one male and one female, were calves. Stranding of this species was first reported in 1975 and, subsequently occurred at an interval of3.50 (SE=l.ll) years. Dwarf Killer Whale: Feresa attenuata Six strandings (nine individuals), four on Maui and two on Hawai'i occurred on five different months. Of the individuals sexed (5), four were males. This species was first reported in the stranding record in 1975 and subsequently stranded at intervals of 9.25 (SE=1.53) years. False Killer Whale: Pseudorca crassidens Out of six strandings, four occurred on O'ahu, one on Kaua'i and one on Hawai'i. Interestingly, all of the 0'ahu strandings occurred in the southeastern portion of the island in a small area between Kailua and the Mokapu Peninsula in January 1974, October 1979 and 1980, and September 1986. Three animals were sexed, a male and two females. The first reported stranding occurred in 1974~Stranding interval was 3.83 (SE=0.59). Risso's Dolphin: Grampus griseus \"Five strandings occurred; three were on Maui, all in the month of February, one on O'ahu, and one on Moloka'i. The first stranding was reported in 1977. Subsequently the stranding interval was 5.50 (SE=1.66) years. Of the eight animals sexed four were males and four were females. Cuvier's Beaked Whale: Ziphius cavirostris The Cuvier's beaked whale stranded five times, twice in January on Hawai'i, twice on 0'ahu, and once on Kaua'i. Of three sexed animals, two were males. The first stranding occurred in 1950, and subsequently, stranding events occurred at an interval of 9.60 (SE=2.02) years. Other Species A single killer whale stranded at South Point in January 1950 on Hawai'i, aa single Blainville's beaked whale stranded in April 2002 on Maui. The beaked whale was alive and it was a male.\n\nThere are limitations to the information gained by examining strandings. Reports of stranding events are significantly affected by effort, topography of the land, tides and currents, and consistency of a network that systematically documents occurrences (Klinowska, 1985;Mignucci-Giannoni et ai., 1999). The increased number of strandings reported over the years around the Ifawaiian Islands (Fig. 3) is an example of the effect of increased public awareness and effort on the quantity of information collected. A regional network operated by the NMFS started developing after 1987 (Nitta, 1991), and, in 1994, a more structured response team including several governmental agencies was established in Hawai'i. In addition, the number of people frequenting beaches, including those in more remote locations, increased through the years, as the tourism industry and population levels in Hawai'i grew. Not surprisingly, the island ofO'ahu, having the largest population and the most crowded beaches, registered almost half (47%) of the total number of stranding reports. This result suggests that a considerable proportion of strandings may be missed or may go unreported on the other main Hawaiian Islands, where large portions of the coastline are remote. The frequency of strandings recorded standardized by the length of the coastline for each island suggests that considerable effort to expand the stranding network may be most needed on the Island of Hawai 'i, where number of strandings per kilometer of coastline was the lowest.\n\nIn fact, Hawai'i has long stretches of non-easily accessible coastline, and a small population compared to its size.\n\nDespite the increased effort and more organized stranding network, the overall number of strandings recorded for a 58-year period in the main Hawaiian Islands is low compared to other geographic areas. For example, a 200 km stretch of coast between the Loire and Girond estuaries on the central French Atlantic Coast for the period 1972-1986 yielded 259 odontocete strandings (Duguy and Wisdorff, 1988). On o 'abu, which has a similar (225 km approximately) stretch of coastline, only 30 strandings were recorded during the same period.\n\nBeing completely surrounded by a vast stretch of ocean the Hawaiian Islands could present an easily missed target for carcasses floating at sea. Strong currents and winds can alter the trajectory of flotsam. In addition, sharks are abundant in Hawaiian waters and are known to scavenge on marine mammal carcasses, many of which get consumed before they reach land (Long and Jones, 1996;Heithaus, 2001). Furthermore, the presence of offshore reefs may prevent carcasses from reaching the shoreline in certain areas.\n\nThe number of strandings per kilometer, for each compass direction, was not significantly different for all islands combined. Because ofthe low number of stranding events recorded on some of the islands, inter-island differences in stranding patterns by compass direction could not be explored any further. Data for O'ahu alone (Fig. 8)\n\nsuggest that the windward facing coastlines may experience a higher number of strandings than the leeward coastlines. This may be because of the exposure to trade winds which blow onto shore from the northeast. A visual inspection of the results by sector for all islands suggests that strandings are, in general, less common in the sectors facing south, generally less exposed to onshore wind conditions than in the other sectors (Fig. 6). In general, it is likely that each island, because of its shape and orientation, experiences a unique combination of exposure to wind and currents, and therefore a unique pattern of strandings.\n\nStrandings occurred during all seasons with no statistically significant trend, although there was a slight spike in occurrences in the month of June. Results of aerial surveys conducted around 0'ahu year-round (Maldini, Chapter 4 of this dissertation) indicated, in contrast, an increase in the frequency of occurrence of odontocete sightings in the winter.\n\nAll species included in the stranding record were previously documented by Shallenberger (1981), who provided the first report on the status of odontocetes in Hawaiian waters, while Mobley et ai. (2000) documented 13 of them during aerial surveys of the region in 1993-1998. Aerial surveys around O'ahu between 1998-2000 (Maldini, Chapter 4 of this dissertation) sighted only seven ofthe species documented in the historical stranding record. These results emphasize that short-term survey studies may not be suitable to describe odontocete species diversity. In addition, long-term stranding databases generally detect the presence of species which may be missed by systematic surveys because of their tendency to be cryptic, either due to their size, surfacing behavior or pelagic life history. This was the case, for example, for Kogia sp.\n\nand for the Cuvier's beaked whale, which were present in the stranding record, but but rarely (if at all) sighted during systematic surveys.\n\nIn fact, aerial surveys (Mobley et ai., 2000) found Kogia sp. only twice, and the Cuvier's beaked whale seven times over an area of71,954 km. Instead, Kogia sp.was never sighted during year-round aerial surveys of waters 0-500 m in depth around O'ahu between 1998 and 2000 (Ma1dini, Chapter 4 ofthis dissertation), while the Cuvier's beaked whale was sighted only three times. The small size of Kogia sp. and its tendency to spend short periods at the surface make it difficult to sight in the field, and stranding records, in this case, may provide the best indication of occurrence in a particular area.\n\nBased on the high frequency of stranding, these animals appear to be abundant in\n\nHawaiian waters year-round. Kogia sp. sightings have occurred in the past near Ka'ena Point, Makapu'u Point, and along the Waianae and south shore coasts ofO'ahu, near Laha'ina, Maui, and between Hawai'i and Maui (Shallenberger, 1981; Mobley et a/., 2000; pers. obs. by the author, D.M.). Shallenberger (1981) included the dwarf sperm whale as unconfirmed in Hawai'i. Since then at least four specimens have been confirmed in the stranding record. It is difficult to determine how common Cuvier's beaked whales are in Hawaiian waters. Stranding records are few in Hawai'i suggesting this species to be rare. Being deep divers, these whales are probably difficult to encounter at sea and recorded sightings have been sparse. Shallenberger (1981) reported their presence west of Lana'i and north of Maui, and in the North Western Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Maldini (Chapter 4 this dissertation) never recorded them around O'ahu, while Mobley et at. (2000) reported them near Kaua'i, Ni'ihau and Hawai'i and estimated an abundance of 43 (CV=0.51) within 25 nautical miles of the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nOther species likely to be cryptic to surveys are the sperm whale, which was fourth in frequency of occurrence in the stranding record, and the Blainville's beaked whale. Sperm whales are classified as endangered and their status in Hawaiian waters is poorly known. Hawai'i marked the center of the nineteenth century whaling grounds for sperm whales (Gilmore, 1959;Townsend, 1935), although actual population estimates before exploitation are not available. Because sperm whales are generally found in deep waters (Balcomb, 1987), and because their carcasses tend to sink, they are not a good candidate for stranding, which suggests that more strandings than the actual number reported would occur if this was not the case. The frequency of occurrence in the stranding record suggests this species is common around the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nSperm whales prefer deep waters. Seven strandings occurred on Kaua'i, which is directly adjacent to deep water, as opposed to other areas where the island slope is more gentle and deep waters tend to occur farther offshore. Balcomb (1987) reported sperm whales in the channels around Maui in late spring through fall, most in \"nursery herds\" of females and calves and in \"harem herds\" containing one adult male. Sperm whales were also reported off of Hawai'i (Lee, 1993;Mobley et ai., 2000), and sperm whale sounds have been recorded off 0'ahu throughout the year (Thompson and Friedl, 1982). Mobley Because this is a deep water species that is likely to sink when dead, it was certainly underrepresented in the stranding record, but may be relatively abundant around Hawai'i.\n\nThe stranding record may also include species that are rarely seen in a particular region such as Risso's dolphins and killer whales (Orcinus orca ). Stranding and sighting history, in the case of these species, are in agreement.\n\nThere have been only a few verified sightings of Risso's dolphins in Hawaiian waters (Shallenberger, 1981;Mobley et ai. 2000). Since this species is widespread in temperate to tropical waters (Leatherwood et ai., 1988) it is possible that it occasionally transits in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. This species may also be confused with others at sea and may therefore go unreported.\n\nOnly one killer whale stranding occurred in the history ofthe database. Killer whales have been sighted occasionally (Shallenberger 1981, Mobley et ai. 2001) and many encounters by opportunistic observers probably go unreported. In 2002 killer whales have been sighted near Moloka'i, about two miles east of Ka'unakaka'i town (Sykes, S.\n\npersonal communication). Killer whales transiting Hawaiian waters are probably genetically related to the transient type, based on the small group size recorded (Mobley et ai., 2001;Sykes, personal communication), foraging exclusively on other marine mammals from pinnipeds to small odontocetes (Baird, 2000). Transient whales travel thousand of miles in search of their prey and Hawaiian waters may be a better foraging ground as compared to the open ocean. Photographic documentation of these encounters may prove instrumental in matching some of these whales to other populations in the North Pacific.\n\nFor most species that are considered common, strandings mayor may not reflect the actual distribution or abundance patterns. In fact, bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales appeared with significantly higher frequency in the sighting than in the stranding record (Fig. 9; Table 4).\n\nBottlenose dolphins are also widespread throughout Hawai'i (Shallenberger, 1981;Mobley et al., 2000;Baird, 2001). This species tends to prefer inshore habitats in Hawai'i and to reside in well-defined communities with high site fidelity to a particular harbor or coastline (Balcomb 1987;Baird, 2001). The reason why bottlenose dolphins do not strand proportionally to their abundance, unless other factors such as wide spread diseases are involved, may be tied to their relative \"sturdiness\" as a species (which makes them easy to keep in captivity).\n\nPilot whales stranded less frequently than expected from their relative abundance in Hawaiian waters, where they are considered common (Shallenberger, 1981). They are generally found offshore in deep channels between islands and tend to travel in herds of 20-40 (Balcomb, 1986). Mobley et al. (2000) estimated the presence of at least 1,708 (CV=0.32) short-finned pilot whales within 25 nm of the main Hawaiian Islands, and pilot whales were 33% of the odontocete sightings during 13 aerial surveys around O'ahu between 1998 and 2000 (Maldini, Chapter 4 of this dissertation). Mass strandings of pilot whales are a common occurrence in waters where they are present (Geraci, 1993). This was true for Hawaii were 42% of pilot whale's strandings were mass strandings (Mazzuca et al., 1999).\n\nOther mass strandings in Hawai'i involved Kogia sp., pygmy killer whales, and rough-toothed dolphins. Mass strandings occurred mainly on Maui, but never north of Kaua'i and south of Maui (Mazzuca et al., 1999). Mazzuca et al. (1999) also noted that these strandings occurred along coastlines having an intermediate magnetic field and located near steep gradient anomalies. In addition, mass strandings occurred on the leeward shores, in areas of fringing reefs, shallow or gently sloping bottoms, suggesting that geomagnetic anomalies, coastal configuration and bottom topography may affect the animals' navigation abilities (Mazzuca et al., 1999).\n\nThree species, the pygmy killer whale, the melon-headed whale, and the striped dolphin were found with higher frequency in the stranding record as compared to their frequency during systematic aerial surveys by Mobley et al. (2000). These species are not necessarily cryptic (as compared to the species described earlier), although pygmy killer whales and melon-headed whales could be misidentified in the field. Balcomb (1987) describes both pygmy killer whales and melon-headed whales as being not particularly abundant in Hawaiian waters although present year-round. Balcomb (1987) also suggests these species to prefer the open ocean. This information suggests that a carcass may have a lower probability of reaching the shore thereby explaining the low incidence of strandings. Because all aerial surveys conducted in Hawaiian waters to date only covered areas within 25 nautical miles from shore, they may have missed the habitat of these open ocean species.\n\nStrandings suggested a seasonal and localized distribution for melon-headed whales which stranded mainly in the summertime. Melon-headed whales are found in Hawai'i year-round (Balcomb, 1986), and are seen regularly in large herds off the Waianae coast of 0'ahu, the north Kohala coast of Hawai'i, and the leeward coast of Lana'i (Shallenberger, 1981). Only two sightings were recorded during aerial surveys of the main Hawaiian Islands between 1993 and 1998 (Mobley et ai., 2000).\n\nIn contrast, striped dolphins, which stranded with a frequency second only to that of the spinner dolphin and Kogia sp., are rarely observed in Hawaiian waters (Shallenberger, 1981). Thus, the high incidence of striped dolphins in the stranding record is not reflected in the sighting record (Mobley et ai., 2000;Maldini, Chapter 4 of this dissertation). This discrepancy is difficult to explain. Schools of striped dolphins may not be properly identified at sea or may be mixed with other species. It is also possible that aerial survey studies to date covered waters too close to shore to detect this species. Its frequency in the stranding record may indicate the presence of a very large population offshore, and may also suggest a potential \"fragility\" of this species, which causes large but occasional death tolls. If large die-offs were to occur in the open ocean, the probability that a small number of individuals reached the shoreline of Hawai'i would be higher. It is unknown whether striped dolphins in Hawaiian waters are part of the same population found in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), where the species is widely distributed and for which estimates of population size are available (Wade and Gerrodette, 1993).\n\nFor all other species in the stranding database the stranding and the sighting record do not differ significantly, nor there is any reason to suspect that a cryptic life style or other biases may have affected their relative abundance in the records. An exception were spotted dolphins.\n\nSpotted dolphins are considered, by number of individuals, the most abundant odontocete found in nearshore waters around the Hawaiian Islands (Shallenberger 1981),\n\nand were estimated at 2,928 (CV=0.45) individuals in waters within 25 nautical miles of the main Hawaiian Islands (Mobley et al. 2000). Yet, they stranded only eight times in Hawaiian waters and only around 0'ahu. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, and there is no indication so far of a concentration of this species around 0'ahu.\n\nFalse killer whales were reported stranded in a localized area (Kailua) on the Island ofO'ahu. Balcomb (1987) reports that they are found around all the Hawaiian Islands although infrequently. Sighting data (Maldini, Chapter 4 of this dissertation) for 0'ahu support a localized distribution for this species around this island.\n\nIt is evident from the stranding record available for Hawaiian waters that strandings may be a useful tool to determine patterns of occurrence and distribution of marine mammals in a specific geographic area, but not a favorable substitute for properly designed field surveys and long-term studies. In addition, stranding data in Hawai'i suffer from the uneven effort deriving from the remoteness and sometimes inaccessibility of large portions of the coastline, and probably more so from the trade winds creating a bias in strandings towards the windward coasts. Nonetheless, the trend indicated that improved reporting, a more organized stranding network, and/or greater effort due to general education of the public have contributed to an increase in the number of events documented and to a more accurate depiction of the trends in occurrence and distribution.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nEstimating abundance of free-ranging animal populations has been a central question of many ecological studies. To decide how many gray seals to cull in Eastern\n\nCanada or what kind of impact a population of transient killer whales is having on endangered Steller sea lions in Alaska, it is necessary to establish how many individuals are found in the population to begin with. This subject has been at the center of much statistical debate because of the difficulties inherent in getting accurate numbers when dealing with free-ranging animal populations. Considerable research has been devoted to solving these issues and a statistical method known as \"distance sampling\" has been developed to provide fairly robust and reliable estimates of abundance in a variety of situations.\n\nThe current status of distance sampling in wildlife management is defined by a few recent publications (Buckland et at., 1993;Buckland et at., 2001;Thomas et at., 2002b), in which a firm statistical base for the topic is established, and areas for future research outlined. The analysis of data collected according to the distance sampling method is usually carried out using the software package DISTANCE (Laake et at., 1996;Thomas et at.,2002a).\n\nThis chapter provides the theoretical framework behind the distance sampling theory with special attention to its assumptions, choice of models and modifications of the method used during aerial surveys.\n\nThe use of the line transect method is generally recommended with sparsely distributed populations (such as marine and large terrestrial mammals), with populations that occur in well defined groups (such as herds or schools), and with populations that are detected through a flushing response such as many bird species. Line transect sampling provides a way to measure density and ultimately abundance.\n\nWhile classic census methods assume all objects in an area are counted and therefore measure density (D) in a straightforward manner as\n\nwhere 'n' is number ofobjects and 'a' is the area sampled, the distance sampling theory allows for the more common situation found when dealing with wild populations where only a proportion of the animals present is counted because many individuals go undetected. The distance sampling theory assumes that the probability of detecting an animal or a group of animals decreases as the distance from an observer increases. In addition, the distance sampling method allows for the size ofthe sample area to be unknown, as is the case in many studies. To estimate abundance using the distance sampling method, a set oflines or points are placed randomly over the study area, and an observer travels along the lines and measures perpendicular distances from the line to the animal(s) (line transect method), or remains stationary at established points and measures radial distances from a point to detected individuals (point counts). From these sets of measured distances, fairly robust and unbiased estimates of density can be derived if certain assumptions are met. The theory and assumptions behind this methodology are often complex.\n\nThe line transect method has proven to be the most useful in studies of cetacean abundance (Leatherwood et a!., 1978;Doh! et ai., 1986;Barlow et ai., 1988;Hiby et ai., 1989;Cockcroft et a!., 1992;Forney and Barlow, 1998;Mobley et ai., 2000;Mobley et ai., 2001). For this reason, the review of distance sampling methodology will be limited to line transects.\n\nIn the line transect method a population of objects is sampled using randomly placed lines, preferably oriented across the expected density gradient. Once a set of lines is placed, an observer travels along a line looking for the objects of interest with the assumption that 100 % detection occurs only on the center line (\"i.e.\", g(O)=l), while away from the line detection drops off according to a detection function g (x) which is the probability of observing an object given that it is 'x' distance from the line. The value of g(x) is always between zero and one (0 < g (x) < 1; Fig. 1) and is without units. This statement is intuitive since it is generally much easier to spot an object closer to the observer, than one at a distance.\n\nIn measuring abundance of cetaceans, it is important to recognize that animal size alters detectability, and therefore affects the shape of the detection function. The detection function for a humpback whale, which can be easily spotted a couple ofkilometers away, is different from that of a small dolphin for which maximum detection distance maybe less than one kilometer. Detection may also vary depending on other parameters such as cue production (for example a splash or birds overhead in the case ofmarine mammals), observer effectiveness (visual or hearing acuity, attention span, fatigue, training) and environmental variables such as poor visibility (fog or rain), glare, sea state, or speed of travel.\n\nDistance\n\nis the probability of detecting an object given it is at a distance x from the transect line.\n\nThe practical way to measure perpendicular distances from the centerline to the detected objects in the line transect method is to measure the angle (a) from the observer to the object at the time the observer makes the first detection, then measure the distance (r) from the observer to the sighting (Fig. 2).\n\nPosition of o~ject __........• w\n\nObserver.spOsition:::--~Ix Ifwe can estimate f(O), then we can estimate (a) as: a=1/f(0).\n\nThe equation for estimating density (D=n/2La) can be rewritten in terms off(O) as:\n\nD=nf(0)/2L.\n\nWe know (n) and (L), so we need to estimate f(O). The main problem in line transect estimation involves developing an appropriate model for f(x) and then using this model to estimate f(O). There are a variety of models and associated estimators that can be used to fit the probability detection function to the detection-distance data (Burnham et ai., 1980;Buckland et ai., 1993).\n\nIn order to obtain reliable density estimates a series of assumptions needs to be met:\n\nAssumption 1 Lines are randomly located or a grid of systematically spaced lines is randomly positioned in the study area.\n\nSystematic sampling has often resulted in higher precision than random sampling, provided that grids of systematic lines are also placed randomly (Burnham et al. 1993).\n\nSpecial attention should be given to ensuring that the area of interest is given equal coverage. Zig-zag lines, which are often used when the platform of observation is a plane or a ship, should have equal angles or be placed according to some rule that ensures equal coverage.\n\nThis is an important assumption, which, ifnot met, undermines the reliability of the distance sampling method. If objects on the line are missed the estimated density will generally be biased low. It is important to emphasize that there is no substitute to good design in ensuring that all objects on the line are detected. In the case of marine mammals, despite precautions and extra care taken in sampling the centerline, detection is often less than unity because of the tendency of animals to remain underwater even if present. For this reason, in the marine mammal field, a lot of research has focused on developing methodologies to cope with a g (0) < 1. The practice of \"guarding the centerline\" adopted by shipboard observers during marine mammal surveys can often become counterproductive by altering the shape of the detection function in a way that violates the \"shape criterion\" (the ideal or desired shape for a detection function to provide reliable estimates). Some animals, such as certain species of dolphins are attracted to the bow of ships and their numbers near the centerline could be overestimated resulting in a curve with a spike near the centerline and a sharp drop-off a short distance away. This type of detection function is hard to model.\n\nObjects are detected at their initial location.\n\nAt the time the observer makes a detection it is often difficult to determine whether an animal was already present within the observation area or if it moved within it before being detected. If such movement occurs it is important for it to be random and not a consequence ofthe presence of the observer. In addition, significant problems ensue ifthe movement in question is fast compared to the movement of the observer. In most cases the percent of observations not meeting the assumption is low and the effects of movement are not a big problem. If, by collecting ancillary data, it is determined that movements in response to the observer are an issue, the methodology used to collect data should be reviewed carefully.\n\nCollected measurements are exact.\n\nOnly good field technique can ensure that collected angles and distances are exact.\n\nOften, this can be obtained by good observer training and careful note taking. Nonetheless, there are situations where some rounding errors occur. During aerial and shipboard surveys, for example, it is often difficult to stabilize the measuring devices because the platform is moving and the display being read oscillates accordingly. The most common observer tendency is that ofrounding angles or distances to convenient values (generally multiples of five). This heaping can be minimized later on during data analysis by careful grouping ofthe data.\n\nIn other instances, systematic bias can occur when distances tend to be consistently over or underestimated by some systematic increment. The bias can be estimated and corrected using a calibration equation. When data are collected without a fixed width, a few values may be extreme and difficult to fit. Because these values are of very little use they should be truncated.\n\nDetections are independent events.\n\nIn general, models assume that objects are randomly and independently distributed throughout the study area. Iflines are randomly located this assumption is unnecessary unless objects occur in clusters. Marine mammals tend to travel in schools or herd, and, therefore occur in clusters (see next assumption).\n\nAssumption 6 For clustered populations, the probability of sighting a cluster (pod, school, flock, covey, etc) is independent of cluster size.\n\nBecause distance-sampling techniques sample distances and not objects or animals, each sighting, no matter how many individuals it compromises, is considered one distance if the individuals are aggregated in a cluster. Distance to a cluster is measured to its center, but the number of individuals in the cluster is recorded. Density when clusters are recorded can be easily calculated using the formula:\n\nwhere (Ds) is the density of the clusters and (Es) the average cluster size. Because the probability of detecting an animal is a function of group size, the detection function can be altered by the presence of large groups. A bias can result by the fact that small clusters may notbe detected so (Es) tends to have a positive bias. To deal with data affected by size-bias from clustered populations, which are common in cetaceans, data can be stratified by cluster size, cluster size can be treated as a covariate, or distance data can be truncated.\n\nThe AIC is defined as:\n\nAIC=-210g e (L) + 2q.\n\nThe expression -210g e (L) is a measure of how well the model fits the data while (q) is the number ofparameters in the model and a measure of the model complexity. Each added parameter penalizes the model so that the minimum value ofthe AIC identifies the model that best fits the data without having too many parameters.\n\nThere are also other methods to estimate model robustness such as the Likelihood Ratio Test and the Goodness of Fit test. For a thorough review of these methods refer to Buckland et at. (1993).\n\nThe software package DISTANCE provides three parametric key functions for the detection curve g(x), which provide reasonably good fit for most data sets. These models are: (1) the Uniform Model, (g(x)=l for ~w), which assumes that everything is equally detectable out to a truncation distance (x), (2) the Half-Normal Model, (g(x)=exp(-x 2 I2d)\n\nfor ~w), and, (3) the Hazard Rate Model, (g(x)=l-exp[-(x/o-r~] for ~w), which is the only model that will fit a variety of shapes for g(x) and is therefore model robust.\n\nThere are a variety of factors affecting the sightings of cetaceans at sea, such as weather conditions (\"e.g.\": visibility, wind force, sea state and swell), sun glare on the water, observer's experience and training, the size and height of the observation platform and its method ofpropulsion, the aids to sighting (\"e.g.\": type ofbinocular used, naked-eye), the size of the animals and/or their group size, the animals' behavior. Some of these factors can be mitigated during data analysis by using data elimination, truncation, stratification, or by including factors as covariates. Marsh and Sinclair (1989) recognized two categories of bias: (1) availability bias, and (2) perception bias. Availability bias occurs when abundance of cetaceans tends to be underestimated because animals can only be detected at or near the surface. This bias can be larger for species that spend a considerable time underwater. Correction factors based on the proportion of time a particular species spends underwater can sometimes be applied to reduce this bias (Barlow, 1999), but these corrections are not available for the majority of cetacean species and may be specific to a geographic locality. Perception bias is introduced when animals are missed by an observer even though they are at the surface at the time the survey platform passes by them. This bias is exacerbated by the use of untrained observers, observer fatigue and poor visibility conditions, and may also vary by species being higher with smaller cetaceans or species with more cryptic behavior. A few studies have attempted to correct this type ofbias by calculating the proportion of sightings missed using independent platforms along the same transect lines (Cockcroft et al., 1992;Forney et al., 1995;Laake et al,. 1997). In the case of poor sighting conditions, the bias can be minimized by excluding data collected during unacceptable conditions.\n\nAerial surveys are justa specialized form ofline transect sampling. This technique is generally used as a measure of relative abundance, recognizing that the technique is biased and that the bias cannot be removed or estimated but only held constant.\n\nThe difference between aerial transects and land or boat based transects is simply the way perpendicular distance from the line is calculated. In aerial surveys an observer located at an altitude (h) and looking down on an object measures the angle between the object and the horizon typically by using a clinometer. An object at the horizon has 8=0°, while an object directly on the line has 8=90°. The perpendicular distance (x) from the transect line in this case is calculated with the formula: LITERATURE CITED Akaike, H. (1985). Prediction and entropy. In: A Celebration ofStatistics. A.C.

Laake, CHAPTER 4\n\nThe Hawaiian Archipelago is isolated from any other landmass by approximately 4,000 kilometers of deep oceanic water and represents an oasis of productivity surrounded by a relatively unproductive environment with extremely patchy food resources (Venrick, 1969;Gilmartin and Revelante, 1974). In fact, differences in productivity between waters in the vicinity of islands and the open ocean are especially pronounced in tropical climates (Dandonneau and Charpy, 1985). Hawaii's inshore waters should therefore be attractive to local populations of cetaceans by providing an abundance of food as compared to the surrounding ocean.\n\nTwenty-four species of cetacean, nineteen of which are odontocetes have been reported for Hawaiian waters (Shallenberger, 1981;Tomich, 1986;Balcomb, 1987;Nitta, 1991;Mobley et al., 2000). Hawai'i is the breeding ground for a population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), which summers in British Columbia and Alaska, and, to some degree, Hawaiian waters are visited by whales from throughout the Pacific Basin (Darling, 1983;Payne and Guinee, 1983;Darling and McSweeney, 1985;Baker et al., 1986;Calambokidis et ai., 1997, Mate et al., 1998). Mysticetes other than the seasonal humpback whale are considered anomalous or rare in Hawai'i and include fin whales, Balenoptera physalus (Shallenberger, 1981;Thompson and Friedl, 1982;Nitta, 1991;Mobley et al., 1996), Brydes whales, Balenoptera edeni (DeLong and Brownell, 1977;Shallenberger, 1981), minke whales, Balenoptera acutorostrata (Shallenberger, 1981), and right whales, Balena glacialis (Herman et al., 1980a).\n\nWhen reviewing the available scientific literature on cetaceans in Hawaiian waters, it quickly becomes apparent that two species have been the focus of most studies in the region: the seasonal but endangered humpback whale (Cerchio et al., 1998;Mobley et aI., 1999 and2000;Craig and Herman 2000), and the locally abundant coastal spinner dolphin (Norris and Dohl, 1980; Norris et al., 1994; Ostman, 1994; Marten and   Psarakos, 1999; Benoit-Bird, 2003; Lammers, 2003). Little is known of the other cetaceans, mostly odontocetes, that inhabit Hawaiian waters (Rice, 1960;Pryor et al., 1965;Mobley et al., 1999;Mobley et al., 2000). Baseline population estimates for some odontocete species in inshore waters have been reported by Mobley et al. (2000) who have conducted aerial surveys of the main Hawaiian Islands between 1993 and 1998.\n\nIn a time when ocean resource management is becoming an issue, knowledge of abundance and distribution of existing biological resources is ever more critical. In Hawai'i, where the tourist industry is seeking new sources of revenue in dolphin watching, and long-standing local fisheries compete with odontocetes for increasingly small catches (Schlais, 1984;Nitta and Henderson, 1993), assessing the status oflocal species is essential.\n\nOur study focuses on the Island of 0'ahu, where anthropogenic impact is highest.\n\nOur goals were to: 1) identify species frequenting O'ahu's waters; 2) determine, where feasible, their relative abundance; 3) assess the seasonality of cetacean sightings; and 4) identify significant cetacean habitats around 0'ahu.\n\nAerial surveys are one of the most effective methods of obtaining information about abundance and distribution patterns of wild-ranging populations over large geographic areas and have been widely used for cetacean studies (Leatherwood et a/., 1978;Dohl et a/., 1986;Barlow et a/., 1988;Hiby et a/., 1989;Cockcroft et a/., 1992; Carretta and Forney, 1993;Forney and Barlow, 1998;Mobley et a/., 2000;Mobley et a/., 2001). The current study coupled aerial surveys with the line transect data collection method (Buckland et a/., 1993).\n\nWaters between the 0 and 500-meter isobath around the Island ofO'ahu were surveyed between September 1998 and April 2000. A typical survey departed from Honolulu Airport between 08:00 and 09:00, circumnavigated the Island ofO'ahu along pre-determined tracklines, and landed back at Honolulu airport.\n\nWe used a twin-engine Partenavia P-68 Observer aircraft owned by Tora Flight Adventure Club in Honolulu, Hawai'i (Fig. 2). The plane had a large bubble window in the front, and flat side windows. Despite its bubble-shape, the front window did not allow complete visibility below the aircraft, because of the location of the plane's instrumentation. The flat windows in the back were not suitable for viewing directly below, and this resulted in a blind area estimated to be between 70°and 90°vertical angle below the plane, the equivalent of aSS m strip on each side ofthe plane at 152 m altitude.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with an Avionics Apollo 50 radar altimeter and a Garmin GPS receiver. The GPS output to a laptop computer, which captured the positional data using LABVIEW software developed by Michael Feinholz at Oceanwide Science Institute on O'ahu. This software automatically recorded the plane's position at 3D-sec intervals.\n\nSighting time and location (as latitude and longitude) were recorded and flagged automatically when pressing the Fl key on the laptop. Altitude, environmental variables and sighting angles were recorded manually and later merged with the computerized data using time information.\n\nIn addition to the pilot, the plane was staffed with two observers and one data recorder. Sightings were made by the two rear observers, located on each side of the plane, and called out to the data recorder sitting next to the pilot. Two additional people occasionally sat behind the observers. Their role was to take pictures, keep notes or serve as back-ups.\n\navailable for this species). The plane was moved away from all humpback sightings as quickly as possible to maintain a distance of at least 305 m from this species.\n\nTable 1 -Definition of environmental variables and parameters used to determine the acceptable ranges for data used to generate distance estimates. These definitions were based on Mobley et al. (2000). The visibility scale used to judge whether or not to use data for analysis depended on a combination of the Beaufort state and glare. Data were considered acceptable when the visibility was good to excellent.\n\nExcellent 0-1 none Very Good 0-2 1-10% Good 0-4 11-25% Good 0-5 26-50% Fair 0-5 51-75% Unacceptable 0-8 76-100%\n\nThe flight pattern varied. During the first three surveys, north-south oriented transect lines were flown to explore the area (Mobley et a/., 2000;Mobley et al., 2001).\n\nThe next nine surveys used zig-zag lines because they covered inshore areas better. The pattern had to fit time and budgetary constraints while effectively covering the study area with approximately equal effort. With the start point of each line being in front of Pearl\n\nHarbor, randomly generated angles between 5°and 85°were selected to create a zig-zag pattern for each survey_ A line connecting two waypoints was defined as a leg.\n\nWaypoints intersected the 0 and 500 meters isobaths. The length of each leg was determined by the location of these intersections. This procedure resulted in tracklines I I Norj:h Shore :\"\"-' \"\n\nIr• ••....

Nonetheless, humpbacks were counted when sighted and a crude estimate of pod size could be obtained at a distance (over 305 mfrom any animal). Because sightings could not be investigated at close range, it is expected that school size may have been, at times, underestimated. The average sightings per kilometer of effort, and average number of whales per kilometer of effort (Beaufort <3) were then compared between years (1999 and 2000) and among strata using a Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nBecause the number of sightings for odontocetes was too small to determine the value of f(O) based on differences in the detection function for each species, data were pooled using similar criteria to those used by Mobley et al. (2000) during aerial surveys of Hawaiian waters, and by Forney and Barlow (1993) in California. This approach entailed using group size, body size and behavior to determine how to appropriately pool species into similar categories for analysis purposes. Data were pooled in the following groups: small odontocetes (including spinner dolphin, spotted dolphin, bottlenose dolphins and unidentified dolphins), and medium odontocetes (including pilot whale, Blainville's beaked whale, false killer whale and unidentified odontocetes). Mobley et al. (2000) placed bottlenose dolphins in a separate category together with rough-toothed dolphins based on significant differences in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing sighting frequencies versus distance for each species. Because only nine bottlenose dolphin sightings were recorded in our data, we preferred to use Forney and Barlow's (1993) approach and included this species in the small odontocete category. Because of the small sample size for all species combined we chose to perform an unstratified analysis.\n\nTo correct for the lower visibility conditions associated with wind and chop, the number of sightings per unit effort (kilometer) was calculated using data collected only during Beaufort 3 or less (Buckland et al., 1993). The average sightings per kilometer of effort were then compared among strata and season.\n\nSeasons were defined as \"humpback whale season\" (Jan-Apr) and \"off season\" (May-Dec). Because abundance estimates for odontocetes in Hawaiian waters are currently only available for the period January to April, when humpback whales are in the area (Mobley et aI. 2000), and because the presence of humpback whales may influence the distribution of other species, this study tested the hypothesis that there was a significant difference in odontocete sighting frequency between seasons (as defined).\n\nData were first tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, then tested using ANOVA. A Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedure (Tukey's Test) was run to compare pairwise between strata and season for odontocete data.\n\nAll available odontocete sightings were used to assess number of species present, average school size, spread in the data, and seasonality when possible. Sightings for humpback whales and odontocetes were visually compared to evaluate their occurrence relative to each other. An annotated species account was also included for odontocetes.\n\nTwelve aerial surveys of waters between the 0 and 500 meters isobath around the Island ofO'ahu were conducted between July 1998 and June 2000. Surveys covered 10 months of the year, 6,916 kilometers and 47 hrs of flight time (Table 2). Surveys were flown at an altitude which varied between 153 and 213 meters. Surveys were started only in ideal conditions with wind speed less than 15 knots. Nonetheless, weather varied around the island and often the wind picked up offshore and along the Windward Coast during a survey so that some legs experienced winds and seas higher than the accepted range for appropriate sighting conditions. Overall, 5,140 kilometers (or 74 % of the effort; Table 2) were flown in good to excellent visibility (as defined in Table 1) and\n\nBeaufort less than three. The remaining distance was also flownin good to excellent visibility but the Beaufort was greater than three (Table 2). Survey effort was proportional to the size of each stratum surveyed, and affected by the different weather conditions found within each stratum (Table 3). North Shore and Windward Coast surveys were affected by weather conditions more severely than South Shore, Waianae Coast and Penguin Banks (Fig. 4). This is not surprising since these areas are exposed to trade winds throughout the year, as it is typical of the windward and north facing coastlines of all Hawaiian Islands. When conditions were unacceptable (poor to no visibility as defined inTable 1, and high winds and/or rain making the flight dangerous) a portion of the survey was aborted, as was the case only on 1 Feb 2000, when winds and rain along the Windward Coast prevented the survey of that area and of Penguin Banks. This portion ofthe track was completed two days later (3 Feb 2000) in excellent weather conditions. These two days were considered one complete survey.  The overall effort resulted in 255 sightings (not number of animals). The majority ofthese (175) were humpback whales, 1 was a non-identified mysticete (possibly a humpback whale), 15.were unidentified odontocetes and 64 were odontocetes representing seven different species.\n\nNo mysticetes were sighted other than humpback whales, which were seen only between January and April, their breeding season, when sightings occurred 100% of the time, although occasional sightings may occur earlier or later. The effort during humpback whale season was 3,148 kilometers (2,136 kilometer with Beaufort 3 or less).\n\nSuch effort yielded 175 sightings (Fig. 5) corresponding to 317 whales (on average 0.082 sightings/km and 0.15 whales/km).\n\nPod size ranged between 1-8 whales. Ninety-five percent of the sightings were pods of one to three whales, with a single whale being more common (42% of sightings), then two whales (36% ofsightings), and lastly three whales (14% ofsightings). Average pod size was 2.00 (SE=0.09), and it did not significantly differ between 1999 and 2000 (Mann-Whitney U=3732; P=0.801). Ofthe 94 multiple whale pods, 10 included a calf.\n\nMore calves may have been present but were not detected (since sightings were not investigated at close range) and six ofthe calves were detected in the month of March.\n\nDuring the March 2000 aerial survey, whales were seen producing clouds of bubbles and moving in a circular manner underwater toward the surface in a manner suggesting bubble netting behavior. This behavior was seen twice in pods of two and four whales respectively.\n\n• --'. \". '\\ .\" . \"\"\\ \\ . '. , -. ..,. ' .. , ' 500~\\ \\. \"'\\ \\ .-._,!~,,-_. , . -', . Looking at the 1999-2000 data combined, the number of whales per unit effort (Fig. 6) shows a peak in February and March. The increase from January and subsequent decrease in April coincides well with the progression of the breeding season in Hawaiian waters, and does not deviate from trends observed in previous studies (Herman et al., 1980;Mobley et al. 1999;Au et al., 2000).\n\nThe differences in number of whales per unit effort by year and by stratum were compared using the surveys conducted on 25 February 1999 and 11 March 2000, since they were the closest in timing with respect to the progression of the humpback whale breeding season in Hawaiian waters, and had a similar Beaufort state across the survey (Table 2). The difference in the mean values between 1999 and 2000 was not great enough to exclude the possibility that it was just due to random sampling variability after allowing for the effects of differences in strata (F=0.880; P=OA01). In contrast, the difference in the mean values among strata was greater than would be expected by chance after allowing for effects of differences between years (F=39.808; P=0.002). The Tukey's multiple comparison procedure identified the differences between Penguin Banks and all other strata to be responsible for the significance of the result.\n\nIn addition, when all humpback season surveys were pooled, number of whales per kilometer of effort was significantly different among strata (F=6.582; P=0.002) after the data were normalized using the square root transform function. These differences were due to the higher number of whales per kilometer present in the Penguin Banks stratum (Tukey's multiple comparison).\n\nPB ww NS Stratum WA SS ' E 0 . 7 . ------------------, ffi ~. 0.6 Ẽ .Q 0.5 :i: lil a. 0.4 Ul Cl c: ~0.3 en .!!1 ~0.2 g 0.1\n\n\"8.

Odontocete sightings included, by frequency of occurrence (Fig. 8), pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus; 30%), spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris; 16%), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus; 14%), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens; 9%), spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata; 6%), beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris 4%), and rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis; 1%).\n\nMost abundant by minimum number of individuals encountered was the spotted dolphin (406 animals) and the least was the rough-toothed dolphin (1 animal). In this case, number of animals present was most likely an underestimate since the animal disappeared as soon as it was sighted and was not found again. In fact, rough-toothed dolphins are generally gregarious animals found in schools of 10-20 individuals (Leatherwood et al., 1988). School size is shown as a box plot (Fig. 8), which visually represents the spread in the data and shows the relative position of the median, the minimum and maximum values and the upper and lower quartiles. Spinner (x =11; SE=2), bottlenose dolphins (x =4; SE=l) and pilot whales (x =10; SE=2) had the narrowest spread, while wider spreads, signifying a larger variation in school size were present for spotted dolphins (x =61; SE=16) and false killer whales (x =11; SE=6). For false killer whales the highest group size encountered (300 animals) was considered an outlier and not used to calculate mean school size. Although false killer whales have been documented in herds of more than 100 individuals (Leatherwood and Reeves, 1988), a more typical group size is 10-50 (Carwardine, 1995).\n\nSpecies richness (defined as the number of species sighted) varied slightly around the island (Table 4). All seven species were sighted in Penguin Banks, six along the Windward coast (all except rough-toothed dolphins), four along the North Shore (spinner dolphins, false killer whales, dense beaked whales, and pilot whales), four along the Waianae Coast (spinner, spotted and bottlenose dolphins, and pilot whales), and only two along the South Shore (spinner and bottlenose dolphins). The frequency of odontocete sightings (expressed as number of sightings per kilometer surveyed) was higher during January-April than the rest of the year and peaked in the month of February, and in general mirrored the peaks in humpback whale presence (Fig. 11). 7 Jul 3 Nov 20 Jan 25 Feb 14 Apr 4 May 12 Jun 23 Aug 28 Sep 1 Feb 11 Mar 5 Jun 98 98 99 99 99 99 99 99 9900/300 00 Feb 00 Survey Date Sightings per kilometer were calculated only using data with Beaufort 3 or less. The line does not suggest a continuum between points but simply serves to enhance differences and similarities between the two categories of data.\n\nThe distribution of perpendicular distances for odontocete sighting data showed most distances were within 1000 m from the trackline. There was a blind strip averaging 100 m below each side of the aircraft. This blind area was, in fact, wider than expected based on the maximum angle measurable by the observers. As a result, data were left truncated at 100 m for abundance analysis. In addition, 15% of the observations were right truncated. Because of small sample size, abundance estimates for odontocetes have a high level of uncertainty. The unavailability ofa correction factor for g(O)<l, and the reduced visibility below the aircraft further reduce accuracy and increase the inherent underestimation in the data. In addition, it is assumed that the model selected accurately describes the behavior of the detection function near the transect line, which mayor may not be the case. An overestimate would result if the model estimated the detection on the  5).\n\n15S 0 20' 15S 0 157 0 40' Bottlenose Dolphin: Tursiops truncatus (Fig. 15) Sightings occurred primarily on the south side of 0'ahu in open waters.

The fact that three sightings of this species were recorded around 0'ahu indicates that it may be more abundant than previously believed. All three sightings occurred in extremely calm seas so that the animals could be easily spotted and observed.\n\nTheir surface intervals were of 1-2 minutes and the whales hovered at the surface with little forward movement. Once they dove they were not resighted. Rough-Toothed Dolphins: Steno bredanensis (Fig. 19) One sighting occurred on Penguin Banks. This was one individual which disappeared underwater immediately after it was spotted. The presence of only one individual is clearly an underestimate. , \" ........~\\ , , . . '.

Multi-species schools occurred seven times. Three were spinner-spotted dolphin aggregations were a small number of spinner dolphins was intermixed with a larger school of spotted dolphins. On\n\nPenguin Banks, all cetacean encounters appeared to be correlated in that one encounter soon followed another in a relatively small area.\n\nOf particular interest was the association between pilot and humpback whales. On 25 February, 1999 a group ofapproximately nine pilot whales was observed surrounding two adult humpback whales. One of the pilot whales was swimming directly on the nose of one of the humpbacks, a second whale appeared to be nudging the humpback whale on its left side, while the other pilot whales surrounded the animal. Because of the difficulty in keeping the scene in view it was difficult to witness the entire encounter but the interaction appeared to be confrontational, with the humpback whale trying to avoid the pilot whales by swimming in a zig-zag pattern. Another group of pilot whales was observed escorting another adult humpback on the same day.\n\nBottlenose dolphins were seen bow riding humpback whales or in close proximity of whale pods. Bottlenose dolphins were also found in close proximity to spinner dolphins and spotted dolphins or associated with pilot whales.\n\nAlthough other species of mysticetes have been historically recorded around the Hawaiian Islands, our surveys around 0'ahu detected only humpback whales. The period between January and April is typically considered the peak of humpback whale presence in Hawaiian waters (Craig et ai., 2000), with mid-February to mid-March being the absolute peak in abundance (Herman et aI., 1980;Mobley et ai., 1999;Au et ai., 2000),\n\nand sighting data from this study do not deviate from this trend.\n\nHennan and Antinoja (1977) and Mobley et al. (1999) reported that humpback whales are mostly found in waters less than 182 m deep. This conclusion is supported by the current study, since the majority of the sightings in the current study occurred in waters <50m deep near Ka'ena Point and Penguin Banks.\n\nThe distribution ofpod sizes for single animals (42%) and for \"threesomes\" (14%) in this study is similar to that reported by Hennan and Antinoja (1977) during aerial surveys of Hawaiian waters (41.5% \"singletons\" and 12% \"threesomes\"), while they found a lower incidence of pairs (26.1 %), and a higher incidence of larger pods (20.4%) than in the current study (36% and 9% respectively). Our results for pairs and larger pods, instead, mirror those of Mobley and Hennan (1985), who, working from shore stations and small boats, found that pairs (41 % of sightings) and \"threesome\" (23%) occurred more frequently than \"singletons\" (27%) and larger pods (9%). The differences could be an effect of the methodology used (i.e. aerial surveys versus boat surveys), or the result of variability between years and areas. In general, our results are consistent with the patterns observed in other studies indicating that pod sizes are small\n\n(1-3 animals), although social groups of up to seven animals have been reported (Hennan and Antinoja, 1977;Mobley and Herman, 1985;Bauer 1986). It is likely that a large portion of our sightings involving two individuals was composed of a mother and her calf and sightings of three individuals of a mother, a calf and a male escort (Herman and Tavolga, 1980;Tyack, 1981;Whitehead, 1982). We were not able to properly investigate all sightings so estimates of calf numbers are based on opportunistic observations at a distance. Overall, few calves were sighted in our study (10) and mostly in March (6). Bauer (1986) found that the percentage of pods with calves and the percentage of calves humpback whale feeding grounds (Benoit-Bird et ai., 2001;Benoit-Bird, 2003).\n\nFurthermore, this biomass is available to the whales within 50-100 m from the surface at night, which may explain why the whales have rarely been seen feeding in Hawai'i (Benoit-Bird et ai., 2001). The occurrence of feeding in Hawaiian waters may be supported by the observations of bubble netting behavior on Penguin Banks during the current study, although bubbling may also be associated with agonistic encounters and other social behaviors (Forestell et ai., 1977). Several observations of potential feeding behavior have also been reported by opportunistic observers to the Department of Land and Natural Resources in Hawaiian waters (Walters, personal communication) and by Salden (1989). The biological distinction between breeding and feeding grounds has been challenged by other authors (Salden, 1989;Baraff et ai., 1991;Gendron, 1993). It is therefore important to start investigating the role of humpback whale habitat in Hawaiian waters in light of these observations.\n\nThere was no significant difference in number of whales per unit effort between 1999 and 2000, although an increase of 21 % in raw counts per unit effort was registered between 25 February 1999 and 11 March 2000, the two most comparable surveys based on the timing of the humpback whale breeding season in Hawaiian waters. Although raw counts are no substitute for abundance estimates obtained using the distance-sampling method (which was not possible in this study because of permit restrictions) the registered increase provides some support to recent findings that the population in Hawaii is increasing. The rate of increase has been estimated at approximately 7% per year (Mobley et ai., 1999; Mobley et ai., 2001), a rate much smaller than the increase suggested in this study. The higher rate of increase, which is the result of a rough estimate rather than the result of appropriately designed surveys, may also be a factor of the constantly shifting distribution of humpback whales, which are known to move between islands so that number of whales seen during one day may be very different than the number of whales seen the next day in the same area. Mate et al. (1998) have shown that humpback whales move constantly between islands throughout the season with travel distances per individual ranging from 30 to 1,860 km, and that distribution and abundance shifts faster than previously thought. For example, a whale visited Penguin Banks and five islands (820 km) in 10 days (Mate et al., 1998). For this reason, a number of surveys within the same season may provide improved estimates of abundance, by moderating the effects of these variations.\n\nThe frequency of encounter of odontocetes around 0'ahu was overall low relative to area surveyed. Only seven of the 19 species of odontocetes reported for Hawaiian waters by Shallenberger (1981) were sighted. Since surveys were limited to waters less than 500 m in depth, much ofthe sperm whale's habitat, which generally includes waters as shallow as 200 m (Carwardine, 1995), but more typically from 500 to 1800 m or deeper (Balcomb, 1989), may have been missed.\n\nThe absence of other species in the sighting record may be an artifact of the methodology used. Pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, for example, were never sighted during our surveys but are known to occur around O'ahu, especially along the Waianae coast (Maldini, personal observation) with possibly higher frequency than predicted. This species small size, dark coloration and generally evasive behavior, spending only brief times at the surface, increases the probability that any occurrence may be missed by an observer at altitude. Pygmy sperm whales are believed to be more common than dwarfs but distinguishing the two species at sea is almost impossible. Between 1949 and 1995, eighteen strandings of Kogia sp. were recorded (Tomich, 1986;Nitta, 1991;Maldini, Chapter 2 of this dissertation). Of these, six occurred along the windward coast 0'ahu.\n\nMore surprising is the lack of sightings of melon-headed whales which are generally found in large aggregations especially off the Waianae coast ofO'ahu (Shallenberger, 1981) and, despite their dark coloration, these whales should not escape an observer at altitude. Eight strandings of melon-headed whales, all around O'ahu, were reported between 1949 and 1995 (Nishiwaki and Norris, 1966; Maldini, Chapter 2 ofthis dissertation).\n\nThe pygmy killer whale is known to occur in Hawai'i but is considered rare. Nitta (1991) documented five strandings on Maui and the Big Island. Pryor et al. (1965) reported that pygmy killer whales have been observed several times off the lee shores of O'ahu. Mobley et al. (1999) never saw this species during their aerial survey effort between 1993 and 1998, and reported two sightings in 2003 (Mobley, unpubished data), suggesting this species is rare.\n\nThe distribution of odontocetes around 0'ahu and Penguin Banks needs to be interpreted in the context of the distribution of food patches in the study area. Since waters surrounding Hawai'i constitute a continuum, O'ahu is only a portion of the range used by odontocetes moving within the envelope of the near-island waters. Because of the difference in productivity patterns between the near-island water mass and the barren offshore areas east and west of Hawai'i (Venrick, 1969;Dandonneau and Charpy, 1985), most odontocete species probably move within the water mass directly influenced by the islands, where food availability is higher. Koslow (1997) points out that the physiology, morphology and behavior of species which are found near seamounts and islands are more similar to species associated with other geographically distant seamounts and islands than to species found in the nearby open ocean. The near-island water mass and its associated productivity create natural geographic boundaries which probably define odontocete movement patterns and seasonal distribution. Although this scenario does not exclude movements outside these natural boundaries, especially by deeper water species, it suggests that the probability of finding odontocetes inside the more productive near-island water mass is higher than the probability of finding them outside of it. This scenario also supports the hypothesis that Hawaiian odontocete stocks are separate from stocks found in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) and that exchanges between these stocks, although possible, may be infrequent.\n\nMovements of odontocetes within the near-island envelope of productivity are dictated by the fine (meters to a hundred meters) and coarse (one to one hundred kilometers) scale at which mesopelagic community patches are found within the nearisland water mass. Benoit-Bird (2003) found that the horizontal component of the movement of the boundary layer in Hawaiian waters may be a more a better predictor of .the distribution of potential predators, since its location relative to the shoreline is consistent regardless of night or coastline surveyed. This relative predictability is an advantage to animals that depend on this food resource. Temporal scales overlap with the geographical distribution of mesopelagic food patches. According to Stommel (1963) fine scale geographical patterns correspond to a temporal scale of minutes to hours and coarse scale of hours to a day. This implies that, to find food, odontocetes may have to move long distances (several to hundreds of kilometers) between patches within a short period oftime (hours to a day) and may explain why the probability of finding animals in any particular area at any point in time is low, with some notable exceptions.\n\nThe distribution of spinner dolphins is more predictable than that of other species because their existence is tied to the shallow inshore waters where they rest (Norris at al., 1994), and to the diel cycle ofthe mesopelagic boundary layer closer to shore (Benoit-Bird, 2003) so that their movements may be somewhat restricted by the combination of these two factors. Given that spinner dolphins are generally found close to shore during the day, our ability to detect their presence from aerial surveys was tied to how well the transect lines could cover inshore areas where the animals are generally found. Because of the inshore-offshore zig-zag pattern of the aerial survey tracks, the amount of time spent in areas of shallow water «50m), with the exception of Penguin Banks, was overall much less than the time spent in waters between 50 and 500m. Spinner dolphin daytime habitat was not properly covered by the aerial survey design and many sightings around Q'ahu were probably missed for this reason. To properly address spinner dolphin distribution patterns around 0'ahu, boat-based surveys and helicopter surveys circumnavigating the island are probably more suitable. However, the sightings recorded conform to the prediction that spinner dolphins are generally found close to shore, and, when offshore, they are often mixed with schools of spotted dolphins.\n\nBottlenose dolphins, may rely on a more variable set of resources and may also forage during the day near the slope of the islands or over shallow reefs feeding on medium sized fishes (Balcomb, 1987). Their adaptability and prey switching ability are characteristics that allowed them to become widespread throughout the near-shore waters of the world's oceans. Bottlenose dolphins are also widespread in Hawaiian waters, both nearshore and offshore (Rice, 1960;Shallenberger, 1981;Baird et ai., 2001). Mobley et ai. (2000) estimated apopulation of approximately 743 bottlenose dolphins around the main Hawaiian Islands. Baird et ai. (2001) estimated a population of 134 individuals between Maui, Lana'i and Kaho'olawe. Our study estimated approximately 11-61 individuals between 0'ahu and Penguin Banks, although the reliability of this estimate is low. Based on preliminary work by Baird at ai. (2002), movements between islands may be limited, and bottlenose dolphins may prefer areas of shallow «200m) water. Bottlenose dolphins were observed foraging during the daytime in areas of shelf breaks (Maldini, personal observation) near O'ahu and Nitta and Henderson (1983) documented interactions between bottlenose dolphins and the fisheries implicating the dolphins in the stealing of baitfish from fishing gear. Being more opportunistic foragers and traveling in small groups (Baird et ai., 2002), bottlenose dolphins are probably less dependent on the mesopelagic boundary layer and on the offshore patchiness of food resources, which allows them to establish high fidelity to restricted areas.\n\nMost other species of odontocetes encountered in Hawaiian waters are pelagic and depend, to a great extent, on shifting productivity patterns within the near-island envelope. Their distribution patterns are therefore less predictable, and may change both daily and seasonally. The number of sightings for most pelagic species in this study's sample was too small to detect particular trends in distribution over time and space. An exception was the pilot whale, which was common and abundant throughout the windward and north shore coasts of 0'ahu and was occasionally seen on Penguin Banks (Fig 14). All sightings were of animals traveling in subgroups suggesting that feeding may occur at night while the daytime is used to move between areas.\n\nNight feeding is consistent with the diel migration of the mesopelagic boundary layer to shallower waters where it becomes available to predators (Reid et al., 1991;Benoit-Bird et al., 2001). This community is not only preyed directly upon by smaller odontocetes such as spinner (Norris et al., 1994), spotted dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins (Barros and Wells, 1998), but is also utilized by larger species of fish such as tuna (He et aI., 1997), billfish (Skillman, 1998), and bottom fish (Haight et al., 1993), which are, in tum, food for larger species of odontocetes such as false killer whales (Stacey et al., 1994) and pilot whales (Seagars and Henderson, 1985).\n\nPenguin Banks is an area where sightings of odontocetes occur with significantly higher frequency than in all other areas around O'ahu. On Penguin Banks productivity patterns are higher and more predictable than in surrounding areas. Turbulence and vertical mixing occurring in the deeper channel between 0'ahu and Moloka'i (Ka'iwi Channel), which allows large volumes of water to flow through being pushed by the westward current driven by trade winds, cause nutrients from deep water to spill over the shallow bank. The importance of channels between islands in generating turbulence which causes eddies of higher productivity on the leeward side ofthe islands has been emphasized by Smith (1967).\n\nA large number of cetaceans was concentrated in a small area within Penguin Banks during aerial surveys conducted when humpback whales were present in Hawaiian waters. All sightings appeared to be interrelated, with some degree of association between different species. It is possible that the association between humpback whales and odontocetes in these waters is caused by humpback whales acting as Fish\n\nAggregating Devices (FADs), and therefore attracting odontocetes to them. In fact, a humpback whale was observed traveling near the north shore preceded and followed by a large school of fish, possibly tuna, swimming directly underneath it. Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) and other floating structures are known to attract a variety of fish (over 333 species belonging to 96 families have been recorded in the literature) (Castro et al., 2002). In Hawaii, FADs have been successfully used to attract tuna (Higashi, 1994;Brill et al., 1999). These devices are much smaller than a humpback whale, yet they are extremely effective. It is therefore possible that a large whale has the same aggregating effect on fish.\n\nOther associations with humpback whales by odontocetes may be predatory in nature, such as those observed between humpbacks and pilot whales near Penguin Banks.\n\nInteractions between humpback whales and pilot whales have been documented by Ciano and Jorgensen (2000), who witnessed several individual pilot whales flanking a humpback whale in Norwegian waters. The interaction described was very similar to the one witnessed in Hawai'i except that the reaction of the humpback whales could not be properly assessed from the plane. It is clear that some of the large odontocete species such as short-finned pilot whales (Ciano and Joergensen, 2000) and false killer whales (Palacios and Mate, 1996) do attack larger whales, but the frequency and extent of these attacks is currently not known.\n\nIn conclusion, the factors involved in determining the distribution patterns of Hawaiian cetaceans, odontocetes in particular, are far from simple and are still poorly understood. Although aerial surveys on a consistent basis are a good method to look at present in the water but the sighting was lost before any of the observers could verify the amount. Given the nature of the injury it was assumed that the dolphin did not survive the attack, which was therefore defined as successful.\n\nIn a few seconds the two animals disappeared underwater and we lost the location of the sighting. Subsequently, two attempts were made to reposition the plane on the exact location of the initial sighting to find the shark again with no success.\n\nThe strategy used by the tiger shark during the attack seems to confirm previous observations that successful attacks on cetaceans occur more frequently from the side/rear, while the higher incidence of wounds and scars on the back/frontal regions of the body of survivors indicates this is a less effective site of attack (Heithaus, 2001a). In the case reported, the severing of the tailstock effectively ensured the immobilization of the victim which was left unable to escape. Interestingly, another published report of a tiger shark attack on a bottlenose dolphin calf at Monkey Mia, Australia shows a photograph of the dead calf with a severed tail, and witnesses to the attack suspect the tail was severed before the shark took a second fatal bite into the belly of the animal (Mann and Barnett, 1999). Other observations also support the hypothesis that many attacks on odontocetes are directed to the tail (Arnold, 1972;Cockcroft, 1991;Long and Jones, 1996). If successful attacks are generally as quick and flawless as the one witnessed in the current study, it is not surprising attacks are missed by potential observers.\n\nThe attacked dolphin appeared to detach from the orderly diamond formation of the school before the attack began. Whatever the reason for this tactical error, it reinforces the importance of school cohesion and coordination as a defense mechanism against predation. school contribute to \"confuse\" the predator's search image and give any individual in the school the advantage of a few precious seconds that may be the difference between life and death. Therefore, some aspects of predator evasion in cetaceans may not be very different thanin schooling fish.\n\nOn the other hand, cetaceans have developed very sophisticated sonar systems, which allow them to efficiently scan the water ahead in search of prey and as an early warning signal for predators. Besides foraging, predation pressure may have been a\n\nshaping force in the development of cooperation in cetacean schools (Norris and Schilt, 1988). Norris and Dohl (l980a) describe a dolphin school as an Sensory Integration System (SIS) where the coordination of perceptions helps each individuals \"perceive\" at all times the position of all other individuals within the school envelope, and facilitates responses to information gathered outside the envelope (such as the presence of food or of a predator). As part of an SIS each individual depends on the other to contribute information gathered within its sensory distance, and the sum of the information provided by each school member constitutes the framework used to coordinate the movements and reactions of the school as a whole. Without the cooperation of each individual within the school this system would not work. As part of an SIS, a school may become an efficient mechanism for long-range predator detection.\n\nWithin this framework other cetaceans may prove to be more efficient predators having the advantage ofthe same sophisticated long-range detection system. Transient killer whales, for example, which feed exclusively on other marine mammals, counteract the ability of their prey to detect them at a distance by traveling in small, tight groups and by staying completely silent possibly using hearing more than echolocation to find their food (Barret-Lennard et al., 1996). In addition, cetacean predators may also rely on cooperation to successfully kill their prey.\n\nSharks on the other hand rely on chemical, electrical and visual cues to find their prey. Their success in killing a dolphin may rely in opportunity, speed and stealth. Heithaus (2002a) during a study in Australian waters using direct observation via a \"Crittercam\" found that tiger sharks feeding on a variety of prey (mainly fish, turtles and sea snakes) rarely engaged in high-speed chases, and generally did not attack prey that were vigilant. et al. (1994) present a report by Springer, which illustrates a possible cooperative effort by sharks to kill a common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) by surrounding a school for several hours and flanking the dolphins until an opportunity is provided. It is common in the open ocean to find multi-species aggregation where sharks and dolphins all follow large schooling fish (Au, 1991). The continued presence of sharks around dolphin schools may provide opportunities for predation although cetaceans do not appear to be the main staple of any shark species. The young, old and debilitated animals are the most likely victims of this opportunistic predation pressure.\n\nIn a recent study of the dynamics of tiger shark predation in a subtropical seagrass ecosystem, Heithaus (2002b) found that the presence of tiger sharks may shape the habitat use decisions by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). In fact, when sharks were absent in cold winter months, dolphin distribution matched the distribution of their food. Conversely, when tiger sharks were abundant during the summer, the distribution of foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that oftheir food (Heithaus 2002a).\n\nThese findings suggest that even a low degree of predation may be enough to shape the iongimanus) has been classified as an occasional predator (Heithaus, 2001a). In Hawai'i, dolphins were found in 7% of stomachs from large tiger sharks (>3m), and in 2% of stomachs from smaller (2-3m) sharks (Lowe et ai., 1996). It is unclear what proportion of these dolphin parts is actually consumed alive versus scavenged as there is not published data on the subject. Because tiger sharks are common in Hawaiian waters (Holland, personal communication), predation by a fraction of the population on odontocetes may exert enough pressure to become an important factor in the daily life of these marine mammals. Future research efforts should strive to better understand the relationship between sharks and dolphins, and perhaps be able to derive quantitative information about the impact of shark predation on dolphin populations.\n\ninteractions between humpback whales and pilot whales may be predatory, as pilot whales have been documented to harass humpback whales in other areas of the world. In conclusion, Hawaiian waters are home to a variety of cetacean species of which little is known to date, despite their relative accessibility and their importance to the Hawaiian ecosystem. It is our duty to make sure future threats to their environment are minimized by adopting preventive measures which include a thorough knowledge of their ecology.\n\n2000 Tursiops truncatus 1 La'i'e O'ahu\n\nstelo pepel tutru steeo gloma kogia stebre phyma steat psera ziea Total Mokule\n\n.s::."
