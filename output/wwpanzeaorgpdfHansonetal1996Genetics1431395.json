    "abstract": "Understanding which genes contribute to evolutionary change and the nature of the alterations in them are fundamental challenges in evolution. We analyzed regulatory and enzymatic genes in the maize anthocyanin pathway as related to the evolution of anthocyanin-pigmented kernels in maize from colorless kernels of its progenitor, teosinte. Genetic tesb indicate that teosinte possesses functional alleles at all enzymatic loci. At two regulatory loci, most teosintes possess alleles that encode functional proteins, but ones that are not expressed during kernel development and not capable of activating anthocyanin biosynthesis there. We investigated nucleotide polymorphism at one of the regulatory loci, c l . Several observations suggest that cl has not evolved in a strictly neutral manner, including an exceptionally low level of polymorphism and a biased representation of haplotypes in maize. Curiously, sequence data show that most of our teosinte samples possess a promoter element necessary for the activation of the anthocyanin pathway during kernel development, although genetic tests indicate that teosinte c l alleles are not active during kernel development. Our analyses suggest that the evolution of the purple kernels resulted from changes in cis regulatory elements at regulatory loci and not changes in either regulatory protein function nor the enzymatic loci. D ISCERNING the type of genes involved in adaptive evolution and the nature of the alterations in these genes are fundamental challenges for evolutionary biology. Several authors have proposed that the evolution of new phenotypes more cften involves changes in regulatory genes than in the numerous downstream genes under their control\n(GOODRICH et al. 1992;\nDOEB  LEY 1993). This is an especially attractive model for macroevolutionary changes because it allows for the coordinate activation of multiple downstream genes via a single (or small number) change in their upstream regulator(s), which seems more probable than multiple independent changes at each downstream gene. Testing this model requires study systems in which both regulatory and target genes are known and in which one can use genetic approaches to identify the genes involved in phenotypic evolution.\nTo investigate the roles of regulatory us. target genes in evolutionary change, we have chosen the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway of maize ( h a mays L. ssp. mays). Several features make this an attractive system",
    "full_text": "' Present address: Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Elm-for evolutionary study. First, this pathway controls a phenotype, anthocyanin-pigmented kernels, that is common among maize landraces but unknown in the wild progenitor of maize, teosinte (Zea spp.) . The evolution of anthocyanin-pigmented kernels is most certainly the result of human selection that favored the brilliant hues of purple, red, and blue that anthocyanin produces over the far less colorful anthocyaninless kernels of teosinte. Second, the structural and regulatory loci in the pathway have been characterized at both the molecular and genetic levels. Thus, one can simultaneously assay changes at the different levels of the regulatory hierarchy. Third, because maize and teosinte are fully interfertile, one can use genetics to identify the genes that control the phenotypic differences between them.\n\nThe anthocyanin pathway of maize includes eight known enzymatic genes ( a l , a2, bzl, bz2, c2, chi, pr and whp) that catalyze the biosynthesis or transport of anthocyanin, and five regulatory genes (b, GI, pl, r, and v p l ) that govern the tissue-specific expression of anthocyanin synthesis (COE et al. 1988;HOLTON and CORNISH 1995). Available genetic stocks enable one to determine the allelic composition of a new type of maize or teosinte at most of the above loci.\n\nAmong the loci in the anthocyanin pathway, we have chosen c l for molecular evolutionary analysis. The structure and function of the e l locus have been studied in remarkable detail, and a number of e l alleles have been characterized at both genetic and molecular levels. The wild-type C1 allele contains three exons and two introns (Figure 1) and encodes a protein of 273 amino acids in length (PAz- ARES et al. 1987). The wildtype protein functions as a transcriptional activator of structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway (PAz-ARES et al. 1990;GOFF et al. 1991). Critical to our study, functional assays have identified the elements in the cl promoter necessary for its expression during kernel development (HATTORI et al. 1992).\n\nStudy of evolutionary questions in maize and teosinte is facilitated by extensive research on their systematics (WILKES 1967;KATO 1976;GOODMAN 1978;ILTIS and DOEBLEY 1980;MCCLINTOCK et al. 1981;ZIMMER et al. 1988). The genus Zea consists of four species of outcrossing perennial and annual grasses native to Mexico and Central America. The genus is divided into two sections: section Luxuriantes, which contains 2. diploperennis, 2. perennis, and Z. luxurians, and section &a, which contains a single highly polymorphic species, Z. mays. DOEBLEY (1990a) defined four subspecies within Z. mays: (1) ssp. pamiglumis, a teosinte from southwestern Mexico, (2) ssp. mexieana, a teosinte from central and northern Mexico, (3) ssp. huehuetenangensis, a teosinte from western Guatemala, and (4) ssp. mays, the cultigen maize, which probably shares its closest relationship to ssp. pamiglumis (APPENDIX).\n\nIn this article, we take a two pronged approach to understanding how the anthocyanin-pigmented kernels of maize evolved and how selection for this trait may have acted on e l . First, we use genetic tester stocks to ask whether teosinte lacks the necessary regulatory or enzymatic functions needed to produce purple kernels. Second, we examine nucleotide polymorphism at e l in maize and teosinte to ask if maize and teosinte differ for known cisregulatory elements and how selection and other forces have affected the pattern of polymorphism at c l . Results from these two approaches suggest that the evolution of anthocyanin-pigmented kernels in maize resulted largely from changes at the regulatory loci including selective elimination of one class of e l haplotypes from the maize gene pool.\n\nAllelic diversity: Allelic diversity at the loci in the anthocyanin pathway was determined by crossing a diverse selection of teosintes onto tester stocks for a l , a2, bzl, bz2, el, c2, p r and r.\n\nEach tester stock camed a recessive allele at one of these loci and dominant alleles at the other loci in the pathway. All testers also carried the recessive alleles at bl, $1 and yl, and all were constructed in the hybrid W23 X K55. For each test, a teosinte sample plant was used as the pollen parent and the tester as the female parent. In all tests, if the teosinte sample plant carried a functional (dominant) allele at the test locus, then purple kernels should develop on the tester stock. Alternatively, if the teosinte carried a recessive allele at the test locus, then white kernels should develop, except for the ptester, for which p.\n\nwas indicated by red kernels.\n\nThe cl locus has several genetically defined allelic variants: CI, the functional or wild-type allele; Cl-Z, a dominant inhibitor of transcriptional activation; el-n, a recessive null allele; and el?, a recessive allele expressed only during seed germination and only in the presence of light (COE et al. 1988). To distinguish between white kernels resulting from\n\nCl-1 and white kernels resulting from the recessive alleles, white kernels from the test crosses were grown and the plants selfed and backcrossed to a tester with purple kernels. If C1-Z was present in the teosinte sample plant, then 50% of the kernels on the purple kernel tester will be white, whereas if a recessive allele was present, then 0% of the kernels will be white. Similarly, kernels on the selfed plants will be 3/16 purple if C1-Z is present us. 9/16 purple if there was a recessive. These figures are 3/16 and 9/16 rather than 1/4 and 3/4 because all teosintes also possess rrather than R. Recessive el alleles were further classified as el$ (positive) or cl-n (negative) by germinating the kernels from crosses with the c l tester stock in the presence of light (CHEN and COE 1977). cl$ induces the production of anthocyanin during germination with light, while cl-n does not.\n\nThe r locus has both kernel and plant components with the following designations: r-g (white kernels-green plant), Rg (purple kernels-green plant), r-r (white kernels-red plant) and R-r (purple kernels-red plant) (COE et al. 1988). The test described above assayed the kernel component of r. To score the plant component, kernels from the test crosses on the r tester (r-g) were grown to small seedlings. Red color on the coleoptile or tip of the first leaf indicates the presence of a functional plant component, while purely green seedlings indicate its absence.\n\nSequence sampling: Sequences of the cl locus from 26 individuals were isolated by PCR (Table I). Because teosinte and maize are highly polymorphic, outcrossing plants, it was anticipated that many individual plants from natural populations of teosinte and open-pollinated maize landraces would be heterozygous at cl. DNA from heterozygous plants is less suitable than DNA from homozygous plants as a substrate for PCR since it contains a mixture of two haplotypes that will confuse reading autoradiographs and may result in inaccurate sequence data. For this reason, two strategies were employed to obtain DNA samples possessing only a single c l haplotype. The \"F2\" method involved crossing plants of the maize and teosinte sample populations to a maize tester stock. A single F, plant from each cross was self-pollinated to generate an F2 population. Southern hybridization analysis of F2 individuals using a cloned portion of c l and low copy number sequences ( u m c l 0 5 , umcll3 and b z l ) that flank c l enabled the identification of plants homozygous for the c l sample allele. The \"gel\" isolation method involved digestion of DNAs from Sample plants with BamHI, which does not cut in c l , and Southern hybridization using a clone of c l as the probe. This procedure enabled us to identify heterozygous individuals and to excise restriction fragments from an electrophoretic gel that possessed only a single c l haplotype. In addition to these two\n\nTABLE 1 Taxa and collections analyzed for cl nucleotide sequence 1397 Taxon Race Country Collection\" Methodb Haplotype Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mays Z. mays ssp. mexicana Z. mays ssp. mexicana Z. mays ssp. mexicana Z. mays ssp. mexicana Z. mays ssp. mexicana Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Z. luxunans Z. luxurians Z. diploperemis Z. diploperemis U.S. Inbred Hickory King U S . hybrid Jala Olotillo Harinoso de Ocho Pira Assiniboine Enano Gigante Corioco Altiplano Acoma Pueblo Chalco Central Plateau Chalco Chalco Nobogame Balsas Balsas Balsas Balsas Balsas Guatemala Guatemala ---USA USA USA Mexico Mexico Mexico Venezuela Peru USA Ecuador Bolivia Bolivia USA Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico Guatemala Guatemala Mexico Mexico w22-LC' PI: 311237 W23 X K55 G Ja1 42 G Chs 56 G: Nay 24 G: Ven 485 H: 1468d PI: 213793 G: Ecu 969 G: Bov 396 G: Bov 903 PI: 218167 D: 479 D: 482 I&D: 401 B: Nobogame K: 77-13 P: 11065 I&C: 81 K: 67-20 C: 10-78 I: G36 I: 30900 I: 1190 I: 2549 K: 67-22 Gel F2 Gel Gel Gel Gel Total Gel Gel Gel Gel Gel F2 F2 F2 Gel Gel Gel F'L Gel Gel F2 Total Total F2 Total -1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 7 7 7 8 1 7 8 10 15 1 11 12 13 16 7 9 1 14 ~a Collections are designated by a single letter for the collector/curator followed by a collection designation.

The method by which DNA for PCR was isolated (see M A T E U S AND METHODS).\n\nSequence from P M -~s et ai. (1987). DNA for this sequence was extracted from a partially carbonized archaeological maize kernel from the Pancan site, Junin Province, Peru. This kernel (ID No. 198G2555) was provided to us by Dr. CHRISTINE HASTORF and dates between 550 and 900 A.D. strategies, three sequences were isolated by PCR amplification with \"total\" DNA of individual teosinte plants grown from seed collected from natural populations, and one sequence was amplified from DNA extract from an archaeological kernel (Table 1). In sampling the taxa, an attempt was made to represent their geographic diversity.\n\nPCR primers were designed to amplify much of the promoter region of the e l locus and some of the coding region (Figure 1). The 5' primer (CACTGGGGATCCTTAGTTACT-GGCATG) was designed to hybridize to a position 380 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. The 3' primer ( C A T A E TACCAGCGTGCTGTTCCAGTAGT) was made specific to sequence in the third exon, -580 bp downstream from the ATG start codon. These primers contain B a d 1 (5' primer)\n\nand KpnI (3' primer) restriction sites that were used for cloning. The PCR-amplified molecules were ligated into the vector pUC19 and transformed into the Escha'chia coli strain DH-5a. For sample sequences isolated by PCR of DNAs from the gel and F2 methods, 10 or more independent pUC clones were obtained and pooled for DNA sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0, U.S. Biochemical, Inc.). The pooling strategy was employed to reduce the chance of introducing PCR-generated errors into the sequence. Any single clone might contain a PCR error; however, the same error is unlikely to occur in any two independent clones. Thus, in the pool of 10 or more independent clones, any PCR errors will be represented in 10% or less of the template for the sequencing reaction and should not be visible on the autoradiograph. All sequences were determined in both directions using a series of internal primers.\n\nA number of maize el sequences are available in the Genbank data base. Most of these sequences were isolated because of the mutant phenotype they confer, and so most were not included in our \"random\" sample of alleles. However, we did include one previously published sequence in our sample, the dominant wild-type allele, C1 ( P A Z -~S et al. 1987). With this sequence, our maize sample of e1 consists of 13 sequences (Table 1).\n\nSequence analysis: Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed by the neighbor-joining method (SAITOU and NEI 1987), using the KIMURA (1980) two-parameter model to estimate distances between sequences. The data were resampled 500 times for bootstrap analyses. Nucleotide diversity was summarized by the statistic 19 (WAITERSON 1975) and confidence intervals around 0 were calculated using the recursion method of KREITMAN and HUDSON (1991).\n\nTests for selection were based on the methods of TAJIMA (1989) andHUDSON et al. (1987) (the HKA test). The latter were performed using average pairwise differences as the measure of divergence. The probability of observing the HKA statistic under the null hypothesis of neutrality was determined by simulation of the coalescent process, using the program of HILTON et al. (1995). Simulations were a parametric bootstrap into which estimates of the parametersJ 19, and T were incorporated (see HUDSON et al. 1987), and probabilities were based on 2000 parametric bootstraps. Only third position substitutions and substitutions within intron and flanking regions were considered in HKA tests.\n\nWe used the painvise method of GAUT and CLECC (1993) to test for homogeneity of substitution rates along nucleotide sequences. This method uses a likelihood ratio statistic to test for homogeneity in s, the number of nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide site, along the length of a gene. This test requires the a pm'om' partitioning of sequences into regions.\n\nIn this study, genic regions were defined by intron/exon boundaries.\n\nTests for genetic subdivision between samples were based on the resampling procedure described by HUDSON et al.\n\nWe surveyed allelic diversity in teosinte at six enzymatic ( a l , a2, bzl, bz2, c2, and pr) and two regulatory ( c l and r ) loci in the anthocyanin pathway (Table 2). Dominant or functional alleles predominate at all enzymatic loci, although recessive alleles were observed at a2, bzl and pr in low frequency, 0.07, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively. This was the expected result since teosinte produces anthocyanin in various vegetative tissues (J. DOEBLEY, personal observation). The results for the regulatory loci are strikingly different in that the recessive or nonfunctional alleles predominate (Table 2). At r, we observed only the recessive kernel component among the 45 plants tested. At cl, the recessive allele was most common (0.84) ; however, we also observed the dominant C1 (0.05) and the dominant inhibitor C1-I (0.11). Cl-I had a restricted distribution occurring at a moderately high frequency in ssp. mexicana (0.23), while it was absent from all other taxa except one collection of ssp. pamiglumis. Moreover, within ssp. mexicana, Cl-I was found only in collections from the Valley of Mexico (Race Chalco teosinte) and it was in all collections from this region.\n\nThe recessive cl can be subclassified into two forms: c l p (positive) for kernels that turn purple when germinated in the presence of light and cl-n (negative) for kernels that remain white when germinated in the presence of light (CHEN and COE 1977). We tested 35 of the c l alleles and found both c l p and cl-n at frequencies of 0.51 and 0.49, respectively. Both c l p and cl-n were present in ssp. pamiglumis and ssp mexicana. The r locus has a second component that regulates anthocyanin production in vegetative tissues (COE et al. 1988). We tested 40 r alleles and found both r-r (white seed; red plant) and r-g (white seed; green plant) at frequencies of 0.97 and 0.03, respectively.\n\nNucleotide polymorphism in the cl locus: The sample of a single sequence from each of 27 individuals resulted in 16 distinct haplotypes (Table 1; Figure 2).\n\nHaplotypes 1, 7 and 8 were found in more than one individual, with haplotypes 1 and 7 found most frequently. Haplotype 1, the wild-type allele, was found in maize, ssp. pamiglumis, ssp. rnexicana, and Z. diploperennis. Haplotype 7 was found in maize and 2. luxun'ans, and haplotype 8 was found in maize and ssp. mexicana.\n\nFigure 2 provides a summary of the polymorphism found in cl. Two nucleotide substitutions result in amino acid replacements, and both of these replacements are conservative with regard to charge and hydrophobicity. For example, the amino acid replacement in haplotype 11 substitutes neutral and hydrophobic tryptophan with neutral and hydrophobic leucine, and the amino acid replacement in haplotypes 3 and 4 sub- stitutes an acidic residue (glutamic acid) with another acidic residue (aspartic acid). Three synonymous substitutions are found in the third position of codons; the remainder of polymorphic sites are in the introns and 5' region.\n\nInsertion and deletion (indel) polymorphisms are found throughout noncoding regions of cl, but the insertion and deletion polymorphisms in the promoter region are particularly interesting. SCHEFFLER et al. (1994) noted indels in two regions of the promoter and denoted them Box I and Box I1 (Figure 2). In a study of functional differences among cl haplotypes, HATTOIU et al. (1992) demonstrated that the deletion of the \"gtgtc\" motif in Box I inhibits cl expression during seed maturation. In our study, this Box I deletion was found only in haplotypes from wild taxa. Indels in Box I1 also affect expression. In our survey, a Box I1 motif like that found in the cl-n and c l p alleles was found in haplotype 12, and a new Box I1 motif was found in haplotype 10. In addition, a new insertion was found between Boxes I and I1 in haplotype 7.\n\nClass I and Class 11 haplotypes: Examination of Fig-\n\nure 2 shows that the haplotypes found in maize (haplotypes 1-8), together with haplotypes 9 and 10, have very few differences between them. There are at most seven differences between haplotypes within this group. On the other hand, comparison of this group to the remaining haplotypes (12-16) reveals a great many more\n\nTABLE 2 Anthocyanin loci in teosinte R-g r-g Collection\" A1 a1 A2 a2 Bzl bzl Bz2 bz2 CI Cl-I c l C2 c2 Pr pr R-r r-r Zea diploperennis Zea luxurians I: 1190 1 0 B: Progress0 1 0 I: G5 2 0 I: G 3 6 3 0 I: G 3 8 1 0 I: G 4 2 2 0 Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis I: G120 1 0 Zea mays ssp. parviglumis B&K: 1 3 0 B&K: 4 1 0 B&K: 6 1 0 C-0: Ejutla 2 0 C: 10-78 2 0 K: 67-15 1 0 K: 67-20 \" P: 11065 1 0 PI: 384063 4 0 B: Salado 1 0 Zea mays ssp. mexicana C: 18-78 \" D: 479 2 0 D: 481 3 0 D: 482 1 0 D: 625 2 0 D: 642 3 0 D: 643 I&D: 401 1 0 K: 67-22 1 0 B: Nobogame 2 0 P: 11066 1 0\n\nNumbers in the table refer to the number of teosinte plants with a particular allele. 0.5 was used in cases where a teosinte (pollen) plant was heterozygous, resulting in ears from the test cross with half colored and half colorless kernels.\n\nCollections are designated by a single letter for the collector/curator followed by a collection designation. Collectors/curators are as follows: B, Beadle; C, Cervantes; GO, Cobia-Olmedo; D, Doebley; I, Iltis; K, Kato; P, Puga; PI, USDA Plant Introduction Station.\n\nThis accession had small purple blotches on the kernels, an effect resembling that of PI-Blotched allele of pZl. 'These tests produced only pale blue kernels, suggesting that these teosintes possess an additional modifer of c2 activity.\n\nsubstitutional differences. This observation suggests that the haplotypes can be divided into two distinct groups.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, sequences representing all 16 haplotypes were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Bootstrap analysis provides strong (97%) support for partitioning the c l haplotypes into two discrete groups (Figure 3). The first group, which contains haplotypes 1 -10, includes all the haplotypes isolated from maize and some haplotypes isolated from teosinte. We denote these the \"class I\" haplotypes. The other group, consisting of haplotypes 11 -16, was found only in teosinte. We call these the \"class 11\" haplotypes. The two classes of haplotypes can be discriminated by a number of molecular features. All class I1 haplotypes share both the deletion of the Box I gtgtc motif and a 4 b p deletion at sites -123 to -126 in Box 11. The class I1 haplotypes also share many substitution polymorphisms relative to class I haplotypes, particularly in intron 1 (Figure 2).\n\nThe region encompassing Boxes I and I1 is functionally distinct and important to gene expression (HATTORI et al. 1992; SCHEF-FLER et al. 1994). Given the importance of this region, the amount of indel variation is surprising (Figure 2). It is reasonable to ask if there have been significantly more indel events in this short promoter region relative to other noncoding regions? To address this question, we must first make two assumptions: (1) each indel variant represents one and only one indel event and\n\nB 0 * E 2 1 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 1 c 11 li 12 14 1 E IC -* -E G 1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 11 14 13 15 16 l a l a -5'UT EX1 IN1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 11111 1 5 3 3 3 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 5 5 5 4 4 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 3 6 4 3 2 0 0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 4 1 0 9 8 7 2 1 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 3 9 0 5 4 6 4 6 1 gccatgcttatattgaaaatgtgtc . . . . . . g tgca . . . . . . . . . . tgc . . . . \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-\"\"_ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-\" \"_ \"_\" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . a \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" . . . . \"_ \"\"_ \"_ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \" \" _\" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"\"_ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\"-9\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \"_ atgcac . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ---. . . . \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" _\" \" \" \"\"_ . . . . . . \"_ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \" _\" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"\"_ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\"\"\"\"\"-\"\"\"\"\"\"\" _\"\n\n\"\"_ . . . . . . 7 8 2 4 4 8 1 9 2 5 1 9 5 6 4 5 0 1 2 0 1 2 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 7 7 2 1 9 8 9 0 1 9 0 5 ctatg..tggccc\n\n. .\n\n-----------\n\n. .\n\n-----------. . (2) each nucleotide site has an equal probability of out noncoding regions. Using these assumptions, there being the start-point for an indel event under the null are 17 total indel events in noncoding regions (Figure hypothesis that indels are equally distributed through-2). Six of these indels are found in the promoter region\n\n11 parv 13 parv 1 J 15 rnex 14 dip A H 0.1% 3 maize _ I 4 maize -5 maize -7 maize, rnex, lux 7 ,-10 rnex --8 maize, rnex 99 -9 lux -1 maize, rnex, parv, dip 80 2 maize -6 maize FIGURE 3.-An unrooted neighbor-joining phylogeny showing the relationships among haplotypes.

If indels occur randomly throughout noncoding regions, the number of indels within the promoter region would be distributed as a binomial random variable with n = 17 and p = 32/(32 + 591) = 0.051 (as per LEICHT et al. 1995). Using this approach, the probability of observing at least five indels in the promoter region is 0.001, suggesting that indels are overrepresented in the cl promoter.\n\nRecombination: Recombination can affect variation in the number of substitutions or indels among regions of a gene. For this reason, it is of interest to examine the role of recombination in diversification of cl haplotypes. We used the algorithm of HUDSON and K A P w (1985: Appendix 2) to estimate the minimum number of recombination events in a sample of genes. Using this method, there are no detectable recombination events in the sample of maize cl sequences. There are also no detectable events in the sample of five ssp. mexicana sequences. However, three recombination events are estimated to have occurred in the sample of the five pamiglumis sequences. If one applies the algorithm to the entire sample of 27 sequences (which requires the assumption that all 16 haplotypes have had the opportunity to recombine), there is evidence for only three recombination events.\n\nRecombination in maize cl sequences can be compared to recombination in other maize loci. In Adhl, recombination is clearly a potent force in generating haplotype diversity (GAUT and CLEGG 1993); the algorithm of HUDSON and K A P w (1985) detects a minimum of nine recombination events in a sample of six Adhl alleles, each of which is =2083 bp in length. Similarly, a minimum of five recombination events are found in a sample of 12 maize Adh2 alleles (GOLOUBI-NOFF et al. 1993), each of which is only =331 bp in length. Thus, more recombination events are detectable in both Adhl and Adh2 than in cl, despite a much smaller sample size in Adhl and much shorter sequences in Adh2. These results suggest either that recombination is more frequent in the two maize Adh loci than in cl, or that recombination events are difficult to detect in maize cl sequences because of relatively low levels of polymorphism (see below).\n\nNucleotide polymorphism and divergence among maize loci: Nucleotide diversity has been sampled at a number of maize loci. clear genome (SHATTUCK-EIDENS et al. 1990). It should be mentioned that Adhl, Adh2, and cl were sampled over a broad geographic range; the anonymous loci were sampled only from U.S. inbred lines (SHATTUCK-EIDENS el ul. 1990).\n\nThe c l locus is the least polymorphic locus that has been sampled in maize to date (Figure 4). Is the relative lack of variation in cl a function of neutral mutation rates, or does the lack of variation reflect a reduction of polymorphism due to selection? This question can be addressed using the HKA test to compare r, the ratio of intraspecific polymorphism to interspecific divergence, among loci. The HKA test investigates whether these ratios are heterogeneous among loci by comparing the fit of their estimates to an equilibrium neutral model (HUDSON et al. 1987). We applied the HKA test to cl, Adhl, and Adh2 data, using sequences from either Z. luxunans or Z. diploperennis to measure divergence (Table 3). In neither case did tests reject the equilibrium neutral model at the 95% level. However, several features of the data suggest that HKA results must be interpreted with caution (see DISCUSSION). We also a p plied the test of TAJIMA (1989) to maize cl data. This test did not indicate significant deviation from an equilibrium neutral model ( D = -0.753; P > 0.05). 4 presents 8 for cl for three subspecies of Z. mays. The sample of sequences from maize contains less variation than those from ssp. pamiglumis and ssp. mexicana. However, 95% confidence intervals for 8 overlap, and thus we cannot conclude that 8 is heterogeneous among these taxa at cl. The three subspecies of Z. mays may have diverged within the past 75,000 years (APPENDIX), so that the gene pools of these taxa could be relatively homoge-\n\nTABLE 3 Polymorphism and divergence in maize loci Locus Z. diploperemis Z. luxurians c l Adhl Adh2 c l Adhl Adh2 Polymorphism (%)(I 0.37 2.13 3.47 0.37 2.13 3.47 Divergence (%) ' 1.22 2.39 2.98 0.48 2.57 2.71 Ratio, rc 0.30 0.89 1.16 0.77 0.83 1.28 HKAd 0.104\n\n~~ \"Polymorphism was measured as average pairwise differences per nucleotide site between maize alleles based on sample sizes of 13, 6, and 12 sequences in c l , Adhl, and Adh2, respectively.\n\n'Divergence was measured as average painvise differences per nucleotide site between maize alleles and the alleles from the comparison taxa (Z. luxun'ans or 2. diploperennis) based on sample sizes of two sequences, one sequence, and two sequences per comparison taxa for c l , Adhl, and Adh2, respectively.\n\n'Ratio of polymorphism within maize to the divergence between maize and the outgroup.\n\nProbabilities under HJSA tests examining all three loci, based on 2000 simulations of the coalescent process.\n\nneous. In addition, interspecific gene flow between taxa may retard the process of divergence. For these reasons, it is of interest to assess whether nucleotide sequence data at the c l locus provide any evidence of genetic subdivision among the three subspecies. Application of the method of HUDSON et al. (1992a) reveals evidence for subdivision between samples of maize and ssp. parviglumis sequences ( P = 0.000) but no evidence for subdivision between maize and ssp. mexicana (P = 0.390). There is weak evidence for subdivision between ssp. pamiglumis and ssp. mexicana (P = 0.063).\n\nIntrogression: All Zea taxa can hybridize, and isozyme studies provide evidence for introgression both between maize and Z. luxurians and between maize and Z. diploperennis (DOEBLEY et al. 1984). Thus, it is possible that the presence of a c l haplotype in more than one taxon is indicative of introgression. However, shared haplotypes can also reflect very recent divergences among taxa. We attempt to discriminate between these two hypotheses to determine whether introgression must be invoked to explain shared haplotypes.\n\nWe ask the question: Given rates of molecular evolution, divergence times between taxa and no introgression, does one expect to find zero differences between sequences from the different taxa? The only available estimate of the divergence time between maize and mexicana is = 75,000 years\n\n(APPENDIX) ; this number reflects the minimum divergence time between sequences in TABU 4 Comparisons of a for cl in &a Taxa ma nb e 8 o. oz5 0 o. 975 ssp. mays 709 13 0.004 0.002 0.014 ssp. mexicana 694 5 0.012 0.005 0.055 ssp. paruiglumis 684 5 0.015 0.006 0.069 *Number of silent nucleotide sites compared. 'Number of alleles in the sample. the absence of introgression. Although little is known about absolute rates of nucleotide substitution in the c l locus, estimates of substitution rates in plant nuclear loci vary from 5-30 X lo-' synonymous substitutions per site per year (WOLFE et al. 1987; GAUT and CLEGC 1991). We make the conservative assumption that cl evolves at the low end of this range. Given the divergence time and the evolutionary rate, does one expect to find zero differences between maize and mexicana sequences in the absence of introgression, or must introgression (which reduces the divergence time) be invoked to explain the fact that identical sequences were found in two taxa?\n\nWe answer this question by simulating sequence evolution using the substitution model of KIMURA (1980) with the 4.7:l transiti0n:transversion ratio observed in our c l data (Figure 2). Given the evolutionary rate ( 5X lo-' substitutions per site per year) and a divergence time between hypothetical ssp. mexicana and maize sequences (75,000 years in the absence of introgression), we simulated the evolution of pairs of 960-bp sequences. Out of 1000 simulated sequence pairs, over 50% of the pairs had no differences between them. These simulations reveal that identical sequences in maize and ssp. mexicana are not unexpected, even in the absence of introgression, given the divergence time and the rate of nucleotide substitution. These results indicate that introgression need not be invoked to explain sequence identities among any of the subspecies of Z. mays.\n\nThis analysis can be applied to the sequence identity observed between 2. mays and species in the section Luxuriantes. The available estimate of divergence times from isozyme data suggests that the two sections of the genus Zea diverged = 135,000 years ago (APPENDIX).\n\nWith this divergence time, our simulations reveal that 20% of sequence pairs have no differences between them, suggesting both that identical haplotypes are not significantly rare (i.e., expected in frequencies < 0.05), and introgression need not be invoked to explain Evolution of Anthocyanin Synthesis 1403\n\nshared haplotypes among taxa from different sections of Zea.\n\nA number of points must be made about these analyses. First, these analyses do not reject the hypothesis that introgression has occurred but simply suggest that introgression need not be invoked to explain the fact that identical sequences were found in different taxa. Second, divergence time estimates may be inaccurate. Third, these analyses are heavily assumption laden. Ideally, one would use a coalescent approach, which accounts for correlations due to phylogenetic relationships among sequences and considers haplotype frequencies, to examine whether multi-sequence profiles are consistent with a lack of introgression. However, given that there is evidence for selection at the c l locus (DISCUSSION), an equilibrium neutral coalescent model is not appropriate, and it is therefore difficult to select an appropriate coalescent model for study. Finally, because we apply the relatively rapid synonymous rate to the entire 960 bp when in fact much of the gene evolves at the much slower nonsynonymous rate, the likelihood of finding identical sequences in the different taxa should be even greater than our test indicates.\n\nAllelic diversity at cl: Teosinte possesses dominant functional alleles at high frequency at all enzymatic loci that we assayed (Table 2). In contrast, at the two regulatory loci ( c l and r ) , recessive alleles incapable of activating the anthocyanin pathway during kernel maturation predominate. At r, the dominant function allele for kernel color was absent; however, because we sampled only 45 plants, there is a clear possibility that functional r alleles exist in teosinte at low frequency. At c l , dominant C1 was observed in a single teosinte population. This may indicate either that C l is native to teosinte or it may represent a recent introgression event from maize.\n\nOur observations on allelic diversity at the anthocyanin loci in teosinte enable us to make several inferences about the evolution of the purple kernel phenotype. First, the evolution of this trait in maize must have been accomplished by changes at the regulatory loci rather than the enzymatic loci. This conforms to predictions that regulatory loci are key players in the evolution of new phenotypes (GOODRICH et al. 1992;DOEBLEY 1993). Second, the evolution of purple kernels required selection for functional alleles at both cl and r. This requirement raises the intriguing possibility that C1 and R are harbored in different teosinte populations and that the evolution of purple kernels was accomplished when maize cultivators recombined existing allelic variation, creating a population that possessed functional alleles at both loci. Third, once functional C l and R alleles were combined, a variety of colors could be produced by combinations with other teosinte alleles such as pr to produce red kernels.\n\nThe nature of the changes in rand cl involved in the evolution of purple kernels can be inferred from our genetic tests. For cl, teosinte possesses the cl? allele at high frequency, indicating that many teosintes make functional C1 protein, but only during germination and not during kernel maturation (CHEN and COE 1977). Similarly, teosinte possesses the functional plant component (r-T allele) at r indicating that teosinte makes functional R protein, but only in vegetative tissues and not in the kernel. These observations suggest that purple kernels evolved not by changes in the protein products of these genes since teosinte makes both functional proteins, but rather by changes in their cisregulatory elements that enabled their activation during seed maturation. These inferences are consistent with much prior research that has shown that the different tissue specific patterns of anthocyanin expression result from cisregulatory differences among alleles at regulatory genes (LUDWIG et al. 1990;HATTORI et al. 1992; RADI-CELLA et al. 1992;PATTERSON et al. 1995).\n\nIntrogression: Introgression can substantially impact the amount of polymorphism at a locus (RIESEBERG and WENDEL 1993). The issue of introgression arises for c1 because haplotypes 1, 7 and 8 were found in more than one taxon and all species of &a are interfertile. We take a new approach to investigate whether introgression or retention of an ancient haplotype explains this distribution. We calculated the probability that the haplotypes could have survived since divergence from the common ancestor without accumulating any mutational differences. Our simulation results indicate that the divergence times are sufficiently small for cl haplotypes to have been retained without alteration since the divergence from the common ancestor. Thus, introgression need not be invoked to explain the shared haplotypes. Our analysis does not preclude the possibility that introgression has occurred, but our approach to this question provides an objective criterion by which introgression and ancient retention can be distinguished. Given the historical interest in introgression and the growth of molecular sequence data for Zea and other genera, the probability that the haplotypes could have survived unaltered since divergence should be considered before introgression is inferred.\n\nThe case for reduction in polymorphism due to selection: While both class I and class I1 haplotypes were observed in teosinte, our maize sample contains only class I. Does this skewed distribution of haplotypes reflect the effects of past selection to eliminate class 11 haplotypes from the maize gene pool? Assume that haplotypic variation is neutral and partitioned into the maize and teosinte gene pools such that class I and class I1 variants enter the gene pools randomly from the common ancestor. This simple model, in which allelic types sort randomly into gene pools, is consistent with previous findings that suggested that the common ancestor to Zea species was highly polymorphic with lineage sorting partitioning variation among taxa (GAUT and CLEW 1993;GOLOUBINOFF et al. 1993). Class I1\n\nhaplotypes are found at a frequency of 0.58, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.30-0.88 (using the normal approximation), in our teosinte samples. If the process of lineage sorting is roughly equivalent among taxa, the probability of seeing no class I1 haplotypes in a maize sample of 13 alleles is quite low [ P (no class I1 haplotypes) = (1 -0.58)13 < 0.0011. This result holds even when the lower bound estimate of class I1 frequency is used [ P (no class I1 haplotypes) = (1 -0.30)13 = 0.011. Although the \"lineage sorting\" model on which these estimates are based is quite simplistic, these calculations tend to suggest that class I1 haplotypes are underrepresented in the maize gene pool. One explanation for this underrepresentation is that selection has acted to remove class I1 haplotypes from the maize gene pool.\n\nIt should be noted that two class I1 alleles (the cl-n and c1-p alleles) have been isolated from maize. These two alleles were isolated because of their mutant phenotypes, the lack of anthocyanin pigmentation in kernels (SCHEFFLER et al. 1994). For this reason, they were not included in our random sample of maize alleles. However, inclusion of these haplotypes in the above analysis does not dramatically alter the conclusion that class I1 haplotypes are underrepresented in the maize sample (data not shown).\n\nIf selection has acted to reduce polymorphism in the c l locus of maize, it is important to consider its nature. Our sample of maize alleles contains only class I haplotypes, but these class I haplotypes likely predate the origin of maize. Among the class I haplotypes found within maize, the maximal number of nucleotide differences between sequence pairs is seven nucleotides. If c l evolves within the range stated for plant nuclear genes (WOLFE et al. 1987), then the two most different haplotypes found in maize diverged =140,000-850,000 years ago. While these estimates have large variances, they suggest that the oldest class I haplotypes found within maize diverged before the domestication of maize a7500 years ago (ILTIS 1983).\n\nThe age of class I haplotypes in maize suggests that reduced polymorphism at the c l locus is not the result of a selective sweep in maize, where a new mutant has arisen and swept to fixation in the maize lineage. This view is bolstered by the nonsignificant TAJIMA (1989) test, which has reasonable power to detect a sweep due to hitchhiking selection (BRAVERMAN et al. 1995). Rather, it suggests that selection has acted to reduce the frequency of class I1 haplotypes in maize. Selection could be on c l itself or on a linked locus. If selection is on the c l locus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that anthocyanin pigmentation in maturing kernels has been selected during or after domestication.\n\nHKA tests: Several lines of evidence suggest that polymorphism at c l in maize has been reduced as a result of selection, but HKA tests do not reject the null hypothesis of equilibrium neutral evolution (Table 3). A number of features of the HKA test, as applied here, suggest that a lack of rejection of the null hypothesis should not be viewed as evidence to support neutrality.\n\nFirst, the HKA test probably lacks power with these data. Lineage sorting has played a substantial role in partitioning variation among &a taxa, so that the depth of allelic lineages within a taxon can be far greater than the time of divergence between taxa. In this case, both polymorphism and divergence measures have large variances, resulting in low statistical power to reject the null hypothesis. Second, the model used in the HKA test does not include introgression, and thus by applying this model, we have implicitly assumed that introgression does not occur (or occurs at very low levels) between maize and the comparison taxa (Z. diplqberennis and Z. luxurians). This is a questionable assumption, because introgression has been reported between maize and both comparison taxa (DOEBLEY et al. 1984). The effect of introgression on HKA tests is not clear, as the effect will vary with the magnitude and direction of introgression.\n\nSystematics of Zea: Analysis of isozymes and chromosomal knobs suggest that ssp. pamiglumis is the closest relative to maize (APPENDIX). However, subdivision tests suggest that maize and ssp. mexicana are closely related at the c l locus, while maize and ssp. pamiglumis are genetically subdivided. Are these observations inconsistent with the hypothesis that ssp. pamiglumis is the closest relative to maize? The answer is no. First, it is apparent that lineage sorting is an important evolutionary process in E a , such that gene trees may not reflect species' relationships. The inference of relationships in a lineage sorting system is further clouded by selection because selection on c1 appears to have biased the partitioning of alleles into gene pools. Second, the possibility of interspecific gene flow confounds the inference of relationship by phylogenetic descent. Assume that maize and ssp. pamiglumis are closest relatives. If introgression occurs frequently between maize and ssp. mexicana and infrequently between maize and ssp. pamiglumis, then molecular phylogenies will not reflect the phylogenetic \"truth\" of a maize-ssp. pamiglumis clade. This could be the case with our c l data since ssp. mexicana hybridizes frequently with maize while ssp. pamiglumis does not (WILKES 19'77;DOEBLEY 1990b).\n\nMolecular and phenotypic evolution: One model for the evolution of purple kernels in maize could be that new mutation at c l in maize after its divergence from teosinte led to the activation of anthocyanin synthesis during kernel maturation. Both our sequence data and allelic survey suggest that this was not the case. First, we demonstrate that dominant C1 exists in teosinte, albeit as a rare allele (Table 2). Second, many teosinte c l alleles produce a functional c l protein as indicated by the presence of cl? at a frequency of 0.51, and eight of 14 teosinte sequence samples possessed the gtgtc motif in Box I required for c l expression during kernel maturation (Figure 2). Thus, teosinte contains the necessary components of cl to activate anthocyanin synthesis in the kernel. If new mutation was not involved, how did colored kernels evolve? The simplest explanation would be that both class I (including C l ) and class I1 haplotypes existed in teosinte before the origin of maize. Then, during or after the domestication of maize a preference for colored kernels by ancient agriculturalists caused selective elimination of class I1 haplotypes, which lack the Box I gtgtc motif, and a corresponding increase in the frequency of class I haplotypes, which contain this motif and thus can activate the pathway during kernel maturation. Paradoxically under this scenario, a reduction in haplotype diversity would be associated with an increase in phenotypic diversity since the presence of C1 (plus R ) in maize would uncover variation at other anthocyanin loci (Table 2), producing different shades of purple, blue and red. In teosinte, with only GI (or C1-I) and r, variation at these other loci should have no visible effect of kernel color. This scenario is consistent with both our sequence data and allelic survey.\n\nAnother possibility is that intragenic recombination at cl has played a role in the evolution of colored kernels. Consider three observations. (1) Eight of the 14 teosinte cl samples possess the gtgtc motif in Box I of the promoter that is required for the production of anthocyanin during kernel maturation (Figure 2). (2) Fifty-one percent of the recessive cl alleles observed in the allelic survey were of the cl? class, indicating that they encode a functional protein.\n\n(3) Only one teosinte population from the allelic survey possessed the dominant C l (Table 2) despite the fact the necessary promoter and protein moieties are relatively common in teosinte. These observations can be reconciled if teosinte alleles fall largely into three groups: those with functional promoters (it?., with the gtgtc motif) and disfunctional proteins (class I haplotypes and C1-I or cl-n alleles), those with nonfunctional promoters and functional proteins (class I1 haplotypes and cl?alleles), and those with nonfunctional promoters and disfunctional proteins (class I1 haplotypes and cl-n alleles). If this is the case, then dominant C l could have evolved by a recombination event that combined the gtgtc motif with a functional protein coding region. Since our sequence data do not cover the full coding region of the gene, they can not confirm nor refute this possibility.\n\nFinally, there is an apparent conflict between our sequence data and allelic survey since three of 14 tee- sinte samples had sequences identical to the functional CI allele of maize, although functional C l alleles were rare in the allelic survey. There are at least two possible explanations for this apparent conflict. First, since our sequence data do not cover the full coding region, it is possible that, although some teosinte alleles are identical to maize C1 for the part of cl we sequenced, they possess lesions in 3' regions we have not sequenced, rendering them incapable of activating anthocyanin synthesis. Second, the GI-like teosinte alleles may possess distant 5' or 3' regulatory sequences or methylation patterns that render them inactive. Phenomena of this nature have been demonstrated or inferred for band pl ( COCCIOLONE and CONE 1993;PATTERSON et al. 1995).\n\nTripsacom pilosum Zea diploperennis Zea perennis Zee Iuxurians ssp. huehuetenangensis ssp. mexicana 8 t ssp. mays ssp. parviglumis B Zea luxurians ssp. huehuetenangensis Race Central Plateau ssp. mexicana Race Nobogame ssp. mexicana Race Chalco ssp. mays ssp. parviglomis ssp. parviglumis Jalisco C z Zea luxurians ssp. huehuetenangensis ssp. mexicana Race Nobogame ssp. mexicana Race Chalco ssp. mexicana Race Central Plateau ssp. mays ssp. pamiglumis  (1984).

Both isozyme and knob data indi- times for Zea taxa: Isozyme data can be used to estimate divergence times among taxa with the formula t = D/&, where tis time, D is genetic distance, and a is the mutation rate (NEI 1975). Mutation rates for isozymes are estimated to vary from to 10\" (NEI 1975). We apply this method of estimating divergence times to isozyme data for Zeu (DOEBLEY et ul. 1984). The results can vary widely depending upon a; however, there are independent criteria for selecting the appropriate value for a. (1) The archaeological record establishes that maize existed (i.e., had diverged from teosinte) by 5000 B.P. (SMITH 1995), thus values for a that yield divergence times for maize-ssp. pamiglumis smaller than this are clearly inaccurate. (2) Agriculture did not exist in the New World before 15,000 years ago (SMITH 1995), thus values for a that yield dates larger than this are not credible. Applying these criteria, lop6 appears to be the appropriate a, since lop7 would place the maize-ssp. pamiglumis divergence at 185,000 B.P. and lop5 would place it at 1850. Table 5 presents divergence times for &a taxa. We emphasize that these estimates are based on numerous assumptions, such as a mutation rate that is homogeneous over time and across taxa, that can not be verified. Nevertheless, they provide reasonable first estimates of the divergence times for Zeu taxa.\n\nGenetics 143: 1395-1407 (July, 1996)"
