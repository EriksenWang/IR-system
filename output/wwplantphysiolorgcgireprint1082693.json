    "abstract": "Examination of an ammonium sulfate-enriched fraction (70-1 00% saturation) of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a high molecular m a s complex (280 kD) in soybean (Glycine max) seedlings. This complex cross-reacted with antibodies raised against soybean class I low-molecular-mass (LMW) HSPs. Dissociation of the complex by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the complex to contain at least 15 polypeptides of the 15to 18-kD class I L M W HSPs that could be detected by staining, radiolabeling, and western blotting. A similar LMW-HSP complex was observed in mung bean (Vigna radiafa L.; 295 kD), in pea (Pisum safivum 1.; 270 kD), and in rice (Oryza sativa 1.; 310 kD). l h e complex was stable under high salt conditions (250 mM KCI), and the integrity was not affected by 1 % Nonidet P-40 and 3 & n L RNase treatment. l h e size of the isolated HSP complex in vitro was conserved to 55°C; however, starting at 37.5\"C, it changed to higher molecular forms in the presence of soluble proteins. l h e isolated HSP complex was able to protect up to 75% of the soluble proteins from heat denaturation in vitro.",
    "full_text": "The induction of HSP synthesis in response to thermal stress occurs in a11 organisms that have been examined, ranging from bacteria to humans (Schlesinger et al., 1982;Vierling, 1991). Whereas the physiological functions of HSPs have not been clearly established, these proteins are well correlated with the acquisition of thermotolerance in a time-and temperature-dependent manner. Under HS conditions the expression of the LMW HSPs in soybean (Glycine max) is increased, yielding final concentrations of up to 1% of the total cellular proteins (Hsieh et al., 1992). Based on this correlation, it has been hypothesized that accumulation of HSPs is a n essential component of a process that prevents heat damage (Lin et al., 1984; Key et al., 1985;  Kimple et al., 1990). Some HSPs become selectively localized in cellular organelles in a temperature-dependent fashion and relocate to the cytoplasm after a 28°C incubation period (Lin et al., 1984). Isolated mitochondria with associated HSPs are functional in oxidative phosphorylation under thermal stress, suggesting that association of HSPs with organelles provide protection from heat damage (Chou et al., 1989). Stabilization of soluble proteins can be demonstrated in vitro by an HSP-enriched fraction (Jinn et This work was supported by grants NSC 83-0211-B002-232 and NSC 83-0211-B002-294 from the National Science Council of Taiwan.\n\n* Corresponding author; e-mail chuyung@ccms.ntu.edu.tw; fax 886 -02-391 -8940. al., 1989); such HSP-enriched fractions are exchangeable among soybean, mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) in providing protein thermostabilization (Jinn et al., 1993). In soybean, depletion of the 15-to 18-kD HSPs in the HSP-enriched fraction resulted in the loss of the thermostabilizing ability, and this ability was again restored when these HSPs were added. The protection provided by these HSP-enriched fractions is effective mainly for membrane-associated proteins (Jinn et al., 1993).\n\nThe LMW HSPs of plants and a11 other eukaryotes have a conserved carboxyl-terminal region homologous to the a-crystallin of the eye lens at the amino acid sequence leve1 (Ingolia and Craig, 1982;Augusteyn and Koretz, 1987;Lindquist and Craig, 1988). The LMW HSPs in vertebrates (Arrigo and Welch, 1987;Merck et al., 1993), Drosopkila (Arrigo and Pauli, 1988), yeasts (Bentley et al., 1992), and recently in plants (Clark and Critchley, 1992;Helm et al., 1993;Chen et al., 1994) were shown to form higher order structures similar to the native molecular mass of a-crystallin.\n\nIn this study, we show by nondenaturing 5 to 20% PAGE that isolated class I LMW HSPs in soybean exist in an HMW complex of 280 kD. The subunit composition of this purified class I LMW-HSP complex was determined. We also show that this class of HSPs functions as molecular chaperones in thermostabilization by interacting with soluble proteins following heating in vitro.\n\nSoybean (Glycine max cv Taita Kaoshiung No.@, mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), pea (Pisum safivum L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Tainong No. 67) were used in this study.\n\nA11 seeds were surface sterilized in 10% Clorox for 10 min, rinsed thoroughly in water, and then germinated in a rol1 of moist paper towel at 28°C in a dark growth chamber (Lin et al., 1984).\n\nOne-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (1970) by using continuous 13.75% (w/v) acrylamide gels. For two-dimensional IEF/ SDS-PAGE, the method of OFarrell (1975) was used.\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 108, 1995 One-dimensional, nondenaturing PAGE was carried out without SDS in nondenaturing conditions on 5 to 15% or 5 to 20% linear polyacrylamide gradients. To overcome any potential problem of slow migration, electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for at least 20 h at 4°C (Anderson et al., 1972;Lasky, 1978). Protein staining and fluorography were performed as described previously (Jinn et al., 1989).\n\nFor immunoblotting, proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to Immobilon PVDF transfer membranes (Millipore) with Gly electrode buffer according to the method of Towbin et al. (1979). Protein bands crossreacting with the LMW-HSP antibodies were identified by reaction with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat antirabbit IgG (Dakopatts, Denmark). Bound antibodies were visualized by reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium according to the manufacturer's specification (Bio-Rad).\n\nTwo-day-old seedlings of soybean, mung bean, and pea without cotyledons and 5-d-old rice seedlings without endosperm were incubated in a medium containing 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 1% Suc at the indicated temperature with gentle shaking. Seedlings were harvested and homogenized with a Polytron in 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, containing 0.5 M SUC, 0.1 M KC1,30 mM MgCl,, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF. The homogenate was filtered through a layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem), and the filtrate was then centrifuged at 300,OOOg for 90 min, as described previously (Jinn et al., 1989) for the preparation of the PRS.\n\nThe PRS was fractionated by 70 to 100% saturation with AS. The precipitate was pelleted, dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH 8.8, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer D), and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer as described previously (Jinn et al., 1989).\n\nThe HSP-enriched protein fraction was further separated under nondenaturing conditions by using a linear gradient of 5 to 20% nondenaturing PAGE. The protein band equivalent to the class I LMW-HSP complex was cut out, eluted with Tris-Gly buffer using an Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad, mode L422), and dialyzed against buffer D overnight. AI1 experimental procedures were carried out at 4°C.\n\nThe HSP-enriched protein fraction prepared from 70 to 100% AS saturation or the purified class I LMW-HSP complex was added to 3H-labeled soluble proteins prepared from the PRS of non-HS seedlings, and the mixture was heated at 55°C for 30 min with shaking. The denatured proteins were pelleted at 16,0008 for 15 min, and the radioactivity in the pellet was measured after suspension in Laemmli's sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970).\n\nFor measurement of 3H-or 35S-labeled proteins, a sample aliquot was blotted on a 3MM filter paper and processed as described by Mans and Novelli (1961). Proteins were measured according to the method of Lowry et al. (1951).\n\nLMW HSP has been described by Hsieh et al. (1992).\n\nPreparation of the antibody raised against a soybean\n\nThe class I LMW HSPs of soybean were enriched from a PRS by 70 to 100% AS fractionation and separated on a nondenaturing 5 to 20% gradient PAGE (Fig. 1). Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1A) detected one major protein band that accumulated to a detectable leve1 with a molecular mass of 280 ? 30 kD in the 70 to 100% AS fraction (lane 6 compared with lane 5). Under these conditions, one major [35SlMet-labeled protein band with the same size was also observed (Fig. lB,lane 6). This major band was characterized as a class I LMW-HSP complex because it immunoreacted with class I LMW-HSP antibodies from soybean (Fig. lC, lane 2). The molecular size of this protein band, referred to as the class I LMW-HSP complex, was reproducible after elution from the nondenaturing gel and re-electrophoresis (Fig. lD, lane 3).\n\nThe subunit composition of the soybean class I LMW-HSP complex was examined using one-and two-dimensional PAGE (OFarrell, 1975). The Coomassie blue-stained gels and the fluorogram in Figure 2, A, B and C, D, respectively, revealed the purity of the LMW-HSP complex. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A, C, and E) and two-dimensional gels (Fig. 2, B, D, and F) were used to examine the subunit composition of the LMW-HSP complex. At least 15 polypeptides ranging from 15 to 18 kD were found in this complex. Soybean LMW-HSP antibodies immunoreacted with a11 of the 15-to 18-kD polypeptides in this LMW-HSP complex, confirming that the complex is composed of 15-to 18-kD, LMW-HSP subunits only (Fig. 2, E and F). Nondenaturing gradient PAGE as the first dimension followed by SDSdenaturing PAGE as the second dimension (Clark and Critchley, 1992) revealed that this 280-kD LMW-HSP complex has a 15-to 18-kD protein as a major band, and other HMW HSPs, such as 82, 72, and 68 kD, with their native mass (from 150-115 kD) are minor components (Fig. 3B).\n\nAlthough a diverse array of LMW HSPs are synthesized in soybean, mung bean, pea, and rice (Mansfield and Key, 1987), the size of a native LMW-HSP complex ranges from A and B, The total soluble proteins from PRSs were fractionated into 0 to 70% and 70 to 100% saturation by AS.

In soybean there are at least 15 polypeptides of 15-to 18-kD LMW HSPs in the complex, and the molecular mass of the native form is 280 ± 30 kD (Fig. 4, lane 1); in rice, about 11 polypeptides of the 15-to 18-kD LMW HSPs are detected in this complex by two-dimensional PAGE, and the mass of the native form is 310 ± 10 kD (Fig. 4, lane 2); in mung bean there are at least 15 polypeptides of 15-to 18-kD LMW HSP subunits, and the molecular mass of the native form is 295 ± 20 kD (Fig. 4, lane 3); in pea there are at least 8 polypeptides of 15-to 18-kD LMW HSP subunits, and the molecular mass of the native form is 270 ± 30 kD (Fig. 4, lane 4).\n\nThe class I LMW-HSP complexes from different plant species vary in the number of different subunits but share a similarity in size of the native form. The conserved size of the complex may therefore be important for its functions.\n\nTo investigate the size and half-life of soybean HSP complexes during recovery, seedlings were heated (40°C for 3 h) and then transferred or planted at 28°C for varying time intervals. No change in the size of the native complex was detected after recovery at 28°C for 1 to 24 h (Fig. 5A). Planted seedlings were observed for up to 4 d at 28°C after heat treatment and still contained HSP complexes of 280 kD, suggesting that the stable form of the complex is 280 kD. An LKB laser densitometer was used to quantify this HSP complex (Hsieh et al., 1992); the half-life of the HSP complex in the cytoplasm was at least 3 d (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Since arsenite and the amino acid analogs azetidine or canavanine were shown to induce synthesis of a whole family of HSPs at 28°C in soybean (Lin et al., 1984;Edelman et al., 1988;Nover, 1990), we examined the formation of the HMW complex under these treatments. It is clear, as shown in Figure 6, lanes 2, 3, and 4, that the size of the higherorder structure formed during stress treatments with these chemicals at 28°C was the same as that formed during HS (shown in lane 1).\n\nThe isolated soybean HSP complex itself was very heat stable for 15 min at 42.5, 45, and 50°C (Fig. 7A, lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively) and was unaffected under high salt or detergent treatment such as 250 mM KC1, 1 % Nonidet P-40, 250 mM KC1 plus 1 % Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 7B, lanes 2-4), or 3 jag/mL RNase treatments (Fig. 7A, lane 5). But the complex was sensitive to 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 2 h. Under these conditions the size decreased from 280 to 210 kD (Fig. 7B, lane 5) and could be restored to 280 kD again by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanoI at 4°C overnight (Fig. 7B, lane 6). In the presence of high salt concentrations and nonionic detergent, the complex keeps its integrity, suggesting that strong ionic interaction and hydrophobic forces stabilize these higher-order structures (Chen et al., 1994). But we In the western blot (E and F), proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS or two-dimensional PACE, then blotted to Immobilon PVDF membrane, and reacted with the class I LMW-HSP antibodies, and the antibodies were detected by assaying alkaline phosphatase conjugated to the second antibody.

Merck et al. (1993) demonstrated the structural and functional similarities of bovine a-crystallin and mouse LMW HSP25; when mixed and dissociated in 6 M urea, the proteins had the ability to form mixed oligomers and combined with any aA-crystallin, aB-crystallin, and HSP25 subunits. In Figure 7C, the LMW-HSP complex from soybean, rice, and the mixture (lanes 1, 3, and 5, respectively) were dissociated in 6 M urea at 30°C for 2 h, followed by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8,1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol at 4°C overnight (lanes 2, 4, and 6). Dissociation of the LMW-HSP complexes was reversible (lanes 2, 4, and 6) and exchangeable (molecular mass of the mixture in lane 6 was between 280 and 310 kD). Using 6 M urea demonstrated that the LMW-HSP complex of soybean and rice kept the higher-order structure of 280 and 310 kD and may have played a similar functional and physiological role in vivo in heat-stressed plants.\n\nIn our earlier reports (Jinn et al., 1989(Jinn et al., ,1993)), we showed that a soybean HSP-enriched fraction (70-100% AS-saturated fraction) from seedlings treated at 40°C for 3 h and then allowed to recover at 28°C for 4 h protected approximately 50% of PRS proteins against denaturation at 55°C for 30 min in vitro. Another 70 to 100% AS-saturated fraction from a 40°C (3 h) -> 45°C (30 min) treatment, which was depleted of the 15-to 18-kD HSPs (Lin et al., 1984), did not provide any thermoprotection, even in the presence of HMW HSPs in this fraction. These data suggest that only the 15-to 18-kD HSPs are required for thermoprotection of soluble proteins. In the present study, we used the LMW-HSP complex that contains no HMW HSPs to test thermoprotection of soluble proteins. The LMW HSPs provided a very significant thermostabilization of soluble proteins (Table I) against heat denaturation at 55°C for 30 min, and the degree of protection was proportional to the amount of this protein added (Table II). Up to 75% of the total soluble proteins were protected from heat denaturation by the addition of the LMW-HSP complex.\n\nThe LMW-HSP complex was added to the total soluble proteins from the PRS of 28°C seedlings, and this mixture was heated for 15 min at different temperatures, including 28, 30, 32.5, 35, 37.5, 40, 42.5, and 45°C. The size of the LMW-HSP complex started to increase beginning at 37.5°C (Fig. 8, lane 4) and became more evident as the temperature was increased (Fig. 8, lanes 5-7). This result correlated with the in vivo experiments by Lin et al. (1984). The size of the LMW-HSP complex by itself did not change up to 45°C with 15 min of heating (Fig. 7A, lane 3). However, the LMW-HSP complex apparently aggregated/interacted with soluble proteins after heating above 37.5°C for 15 min, thus causing the size of the LMW-HSP complex to change and increase in molecular mass. The size change of the LMW-HSP complex was irreversible during recovery at 28°C for 4 h, even when an ATP regeneration system was added (Fig. 9A, lane 5). This differs from the in vivo experiments that demonstrate that HSPs relocalized to the cytosol after heat stress was released (Lin et al., 1984). This protein interaction caused by heating also occurred with heterologous soluble protein systems, such as from mung bean (Fig. 9B, lane 1) or pea (Fig. 9B, lane 2). These results confirmed our previous report that the HSP-enriched fractions were exchangeable among soybean, mung bean, and rice for thermostabilization (Jinn et al., 1993). However, the LMW-HSP complex did not interact with BSA or chicken egg albumin (Fig. 9B, lanes 3 and 4). But, for now we do not know which kinds of proteins in the soluble protein fractions could interact with the HSP complex.\n\nIn the previous study of HSPs in soybean, the class of 15to 18-kD HSPs that shuttle between the cytoplasm and  Proteins were analyzed by western blot as follows: A, 28°C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after the heat treatment in lanes 1 to 5, respectively; B, 28°C for 6 h and 1, 2, 3, and 4 d after the heat treatment in lanes 1 to 5, respectively. Total soluble proteins loaded were based on equal tissue amounts.

In this study, we used this preparation to demonstrate that these HSPs form a higherorder structural complex. The presence of the 15-to 18-kD class I LMW HSP in the 280-kD complex was confirmed by Coomassie blue staining, radioisotope labeling, and western blot analysis of two-dimensional PAGE gels. Other HSPs, ranging from 110 to 30 kD, formed lower molecular mass complexes, although occasionally the 22-to 24-kD HSPs were found in the higher complex form. The composition of the class I LMW-HSP complexes in seedlings of rice, pea, and mung bean differed in the numbers, pi, and molecular mass of the individual LMW HSPs present, but the complexes formed had similar molecular structures in the native gels. Interestingly, recombinant rice 16.9-kD HSP expressed in Escherichia coli (C.H. Yeh, unpublished observations) alone forms a native complex of 310 kD. This suggests that the size of a native complex is not controlled by the number or size of the class I HSPs. This complex formation is not the consequence of HS as shown by treatment with arsenite and amino acid analogs at 28°C. The 25-kD HSP of mouse and the 28-kD of mammalian cells were found in HMW complexes of 400 to 800 and 200 to 800 kD (Arrigo et al., 1988), respectively. In the case of Drosophila, the four LMW HSPs of 22, 23, 26, and 27 kD also formed an HMW complex with RNA with properties similar to those of ribonucleoprotein particles (Arrigo and Ahmad-Zadeh, 1981). The relative LMW complex that we observed in this study appears to be different from the complex reported by Nover (1990) of large aggregates called HS granules. Although they proposed that the HS granules are formed under severe HS conditions by assembly of pre-HS granules, our native complex is different from the pre-HS granules in molecular mass and composition.\n\nThe soybean 280-kD HSP complex isolated from the nondenaturing PAGE is stable up to 250 mM KC1 and 1% Nonidet P-40, but it is denatured by 0.1% SDS and 6 M urea. This complex is also heat stable, and the size of the native complex is unchanged by heating up to 50°C. However, in the presence of soluble proteins either from soybean, mung bean, or pea, as the incubation temperature of the mixture exceeds 37.5°C, the complex changes to the higher molecular form. In general, 37.5°C is the temperature at which the denaturation of proteins in vivo begins. These in vitro observations may offer an explanation of the earlier reports that the class I LMW HSP localized in the organellar fractions, depending on the severity of the HS treatments (Lin et al., 1984) and the thermostabilization (Jinn et al., 1989(Jinn et al., , 1993)). Since the HSP complex alone does not change its molecular size upon heating, the formation of a complex in the organelles is more likely due to interaction of the HSP complex with the target proteins rather than aggregation of the HSPs themselves. The higher molecular mass complex The class I LMW-HSP complex induced by amino acid analogs of azetidine, canavanine, and arsenite. Two-day-old soybean seedlings were treated at 28°C for 24 h with 5 mM azetidine (lane 2), with 5 mM canavanine (lane 3), and with 75 II.M arsenite (lane 4). Seedlings treated at 40°C for 2 h, followed by 28°C for 4 h, were used as a reference (lane 1).

C, Reformation of the LMW-HSP complex of soybean and rice after dissociation with 6 M urea was examined by silver nitrate stain.

In contrast, the relocalization of this HSP complex in vivo to the cytoplasm is dependent on energy (NaF or anaerobiosis inhibited relocalization, C.Y. Lin, unpublished results). So it may need some factor(s) that is absent in these in vitro studies. We are now investigating the protein candidates that interact with the HSP complex.\n\nWe reported earlier that the HSP-enriched protein fraction prepared from the PRS of HS soybean seedlings provided thermostabilization of normal soluble proteins. These experiments were carried out based on the model proposed for the biological role of HSPs by Minton et al. (1982), which suggests that HSPs may act as heat-stable proteins to nonspecifically stabilize other proteins that are highly susceptible to inactivation or denaturation by heat.\n\nTo 1 mg of 3 H-proteins from the PRS (600,500 cpm), 1 mg of the 70 to 100% AS fraction from seedlings of two different treatments was added; the mixtures were heated at 55°C for 30 min. After the heat treatment, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min. The pellets were suspended in 250 /nL of Laemmli's sample buffer, and 25 ;u.L of duplicate samples were assayed for radioactivity. Each result is presented as the mean ± SE, n = 2.\n\nTo 500 /ig of 3 H-proteins from the PRS (197,500 cpm), different amounts of purified class I 280-kD LMW-HSP complex were added; the mixtures were heated at 55°C for 30 min. After the heat treatment, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min. The pellets were suspended in 100 ;u,L of Laemmli's sample buffer, and 10 yuL of duplicate samples were assayed for radioactivity. Each result is presented as the mean ± SE, n = 2.\n\nAddition of 280-kD LMW-HSP Complex US No addition 5 10 25 50 75 100 Proteins Denatured cpm (%)\n\nUnder our standard assay condition, approximately 50% of the soluble proteins that are normally denatured by heating at 55°C for 30 min were protected when the HSPenriched fraction was added. Subsequently, under closer to natural physiological temperature conditions, we obtained the same results by decreasing the heating temperature to 35°C for 16 h or 40°C for 9 h (Wu, 1992). Depletion of the 15-to 18-kD HSPs in the HSP-enriched fraction resulted in the loss of the thermostabilizing ability, and when the 15to 18-kD HSPs were recovered in this fraction, the thermostabilizing ability was again restored (Jinn et al., 1993).\n\nIn this study the isolated soybean 280-kD HSP complex was used to test the biological role for the class I LMW HSPs in stabilizing heat-sensitive proteins as we have shown with the HSP-enriched fraction. We demonstrate here that the class I LMW HSPs in plants, which shuttle between the cytoplasm and cellular organelles during HS and recovery from HS, are responsible for functioning as molecular chaperones. The thermostabilization ability is dependent on the concentration of the HSP complex that is added. A molecular chaperone-like function was also shown for a mouse HSP of 25 kD (Jakob et al., 1993).\n\nAlthough the physiological function of HSPs remains unclear, we have shown previously that synthesis and accumulation of LMW HSPs and their cellular localization are strongly correlated with the acquisition of thermotolerance in soybean seedlings (Lin et al., 1984). With the studies presented here using the isolated class I LMW-HSP complex, we may be able to establish a potentially important role for this class of HSPs in the protection of plants from thermal stress. It will be interesting to discover the in vivo significance of these observations on the ability of class I LMW-HSP complex to stabilize protein solubility in vitro.
