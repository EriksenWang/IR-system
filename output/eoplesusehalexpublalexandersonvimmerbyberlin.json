    "full_text": "Within this area lies the conspicuous Vimmerby moraine, for which we have used the terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide ( Be) exposure dating technique to derive the exposure age of six glacially transported boulders.\n\nThe six Be cosmogenic ages are internally consistent, ranging from 14.9±1.5 to 12.4±1.3 ka with a mean of 13.6 ±0.9 ka. Adjusting for the effects of surface erosion, snow burial and glacio-isostatic rebound causes the mean age to increase only by c. 6% to c. 14.4 ±0.9 ka.\n\nThe Be derived age for the Vimmerby moraine is in agreement with previous estimates for the timing of deglaciation based on radiocarbon dating and varve chronology. This result shows promise for further terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide exposure studies in southern Sweden.  -11 (Middleton et al. 1993). Uncertainties propagated at ±1s level including all known sources of analytical error. c Exposure ages calculated using the CRONUS-Earth 10 Be-26 Al exposure age calculator version 2 (http://hess.ess.washington.edu) assuming no prior exposure and no erosion during exposure. The quoted values are for the 'Lm' scaling scheme which includes palaeomagnetic corrections (Balco et al. 2008). Uncertainties are ±1s (68% confidence) including 10 Be measurement uncertainties and a 10 Be production rate uncertainty of 9%, to allow comparison with ages obtained with other methods. Values in parentheses are uncertainties based on measurement errors alone, for sample-to-sample comparisons.\n\nThis project was financed by the Geological Survey of Sweden.\n\n2 . b Measured at SUERC-AMS relative to NIST SRM with a nominal value of 10 Be/ 9 Be = 3.06 x 10"
