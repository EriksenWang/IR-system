    "abstract": "Finite-amplitude, axially symmetric oscillations of small (0.2 mm) liquid droplets in a gaseous environment are studied, both experimentally and theoretically. When the amplitude of natural oscillations of the fundamental mode exceeds approximately I0oń of the droplet radius, typical nonlinear effects like the dependence of the oscillation frequency on the amplitude, the asymmet'ry of the oscillation amplitude, and the interaction between modes are observed. As the amplitude decreases due to viscous damping, the oscillation frequency and the amplitude decay factor reach their asymptotical values predicted by linear theory. The initial behaviour of the droplet is described quite satisfactorily by a proposed nonlinear inviscid theoretical model.",
    "full_text": "The problem of oscillating droplets has been an object of intense study for more than a century, both to gain a theoretical understanding (Kelvin 1890;Chandrasekhar 1959Chandrasekhar , 1961;;Reid 1960;Prosperetti Ig77,I980a, Ó) and also in view of various technological applications (Valentine, Sather & Heideger 1965;Strani & Sabetta 1988). The first mathematical model of linear droplet oscillations in vacuum in the case of an inviscid fluid is due to Rayleigh (1879). The generalized linear solution of the problem which includes the influence of a surrounding medium is given by Lamb (1932). The solution describes the instantaneous deformation of the droplet shape by an infinite series of the surface spherical harmonics, where each term of this function corresponds to one independent natural oscillation mode. The axially symmetric form of t'his solution is where Ę(cos 0) arc the Legendre polynomials, rBo is the unperturbed radius of the droplet, cł, is the instantaneous amplitude of the /th mode of oscillat'ion, and d is the polar angle of the spherical coordina,te system with its origin at the centre of the spherical drop. The frequency O, of the lth oscillation mode of a liquid drop in vacuum or in air is given by o?:\n\nwhere o is the surface tension of the droplet medium and p is its density. Subsequent linear analyses have included the viscosity of the droplet (Chandrasekhar 1959;Reid 1960)and,later, viscous effects of an outer fluid (Miller & Scriven 1968).

However for low-viscosity liquids (e.g. water, ethanol) and relatively Iarge droplets (fi. ) 50 pm) in dynamically inactive surroundings the general description simplifies and the so-called irrotational approximation, previously obtained by Lamb (1932), applies. Then, the decay time and the oscillation frequency are given by ,,:,ęffi1\n\n(3) and\n\nOr: a/I_(Q,r,)_27ź.\n\n(4)\n\nThe viscosity, lr, of the fluid reduces the natural oscillation frequency. This effect is of second order so that the frequency shift for low-viscosity liquids is negligibly small. Equation (3) shows that damping increases very quickly for higher oscillation modes. Therefore, in most cases the description of the droplet oscillation given by (1) is limited to the first few modes.\n\nIn their normal mode analysis of the initial motion of the viscous droplet in vacuum Chandrasekhar (1959), Prosperetti (1980rł' ó) and Brosa (1988) found that for each surface mode an infinite discrete frequency spectrum exists. This is apparently due to the viscosity, which is responsible for the vorticity generation by a free moving surface. Hence, the initial behaviour of a viscous droplet may apparently deviate from the least-damped normal modes (Prosperetti 1977) which are described by a damped harmonic oscillation. Ilowever, asymptotically with time only these modes remain' Prosperetti (1980Ó) shows that'these viscous effects become negligibly small if the dimensionless viscosity4 l@,rR,)ź < 0.1..Ihis condition is fulfilled in the experiments presented here, therefore it is assumed that for small oscillation amplitudes the irrotat'ional approximation given by ( 3) and (4) still applies.\n\nNonlinear oscillations of a droplet were analysed by Tsamopoulos & Brown (1983), but only for the case of inviscid liquids. Looking for strictly periodic oscillations they have found that the oscillation frequency of the fundamental mode decreases with increasing amplitude. The effect of small viscosity was incorporated into a nonlinear numerical study by Lundgren & Mansour (1988). They found that viscosity may have a relatively large effect on t'he behaviour of t'he higher oscillation modes, changing their near-harmonic resonance coupling with the fundamental mode I : 2.\n\nExperimental measurements performed by Trinh, Marston & Robey (1987), Hiller & Kowalewski (1989rł) for small osciłlation amplitudes confirm the values of o, predicted by the linear theory for the fundamental mode. The only experimental work dealing with large-amplitude oscillations of droplets that we could find is that of Trinh & Wang (1982). Their experiment was performed on drops suspended in a neutrally buoyant and immiscible liquid. The results confirm qualitatively the predictions of the above nonlinear theories, i.e. the decrease of the oscillation frequency with increasing amplitude.\n\nThe lack of available experimental data concerning the nonlinear behaviour o1' droplets oscillating in air encouraged us to undertake the present investigation. The present study of nonlinear droplet dynamics is an inherent part of the method of measuring dynamic values of surface tension developed in Hiller & Kowalewski (1989rł). Unfortunately, both of the above-mentioned theoretical analyses have very limited applicability to our experimental studies of the droplet oscillations. The first one (Tsamopoulos & Brown), with its accuracy limited to second-order effects, does not provide a method of checking the accuracy of the results obtained. The second Large-arupl,itud,e osci,llations of li,quid, d,roplets IgI analysis (Lundgren & Mansour) seems to be rather difficult to be implemented practically for the measurements of dynamic surface tension as it is a pure-numerical m9lhod and comparison of its results with our experimental data would requi\"e additional surface parameterization. Hence, in the -following, we will describe the experimental method and results obtained for free oscillating droplets, followed by a new nonlinear model of inviscid droplet oscillations, which ullorv. us to analyse the experimental data.\n\n2.L The apparatus and, methocl The overall experimental arrangement is shown schematicaily in figure 1. The droplets were generated by the controlled breakup of a laminar jlt disch\"arging from a convergent nozzle into a gaseous environment' The p'\"...,.ó inside thi pienum chamber of the nclzzle is modu]ateri by a piezocerńnic transducer, described previously (Hiller & Kowalewski 1989o). Tńe resulting jet perturbations are proportional to the voltage Ć/ V-no applied to the transducer] Iiy p.op\". choice of the modulation, practicalĘ lrro''odi.p\"'.ed droplets oscillating in^axially symmetric modes are generated during the breakup process of the Jei. rne ,\"q,,i.ń a.opt\"t radius, within the range 100 to 300 pm, is óntainea by varying the jet raclius *ńi.ł, is about half that of the droplets. once a droplet is a\"ta\"ńa \"t,o-it,\" liquid jet, it becomes an isolated mass of fluid suspended iń space. Any subsequent motion of.this isolated mass depends-primarily on the .o'ń\" funsión forces and the velocity distribution in the fluid at the instant of breakoff from the jet. The initial velocity distribution and subsequent accelerations created by the surface tension force produce, owing to the viscosity, damped oscillatory ńotion of the droplet unti1 it reaches its equilibrium spherical shape.\n\nInitial deformations of the droplet observed after its detachment from the jet are illustrated in figure 2. As the droplet velocity is relatively small (a few m/s) the influence of aerodynamic forces on its shape is assumed to be negligibly small. The droplet is observed through a-microscope ln rrlght field illuminatńn] A pulsed light-\n\nemitting-diode (LED)-is used as a light source (stasicki, Hiller & Meier 1g90;. ihe exposure times are below 0.2 ps.

All further processing of the images (image analysis and shape fitting) takes place on 7łVAX II and IBM3090 computers respectively.\n\nTwo methods of imaging are applied. First is a multi-exposure method, shown in figure 2. This method. described in detail previously (Hillór & Kowalew*ti tosoa;, p-rovides high temporal and spatial r\".ol.rtior. for about one oscillation period. However, to extend the observation time, a rather tedious matching procedure to combine phases of separate observations clone at different distances from the nozzle is required. Therefore, to facilitate observation ofthe droplets during longer perioJs a second recording method, based on a beat-frequency stioboscopic tech-niqie, was feve.lgred, For this purpose a digital phase-scanning device (Hiller, Kowalewski &   Stasicki 1989) is used to change óontinuously the ph\"ase of the pulses triggering the LED drive' relative to the phase of the jet ńodulating deque,'\"y.\"iho*-th\" stroboscopically observed phenomena slowĘ change theń phase u.'d th\"i, d\"- Freunn 2. llultiexposure of an oscillating droplet observed a short time after its generation.

This is possible as the rcproducibility of the droplets generated by the controlled jet breakup is extremely high. Using this technique, the images of the droplet were recorded periodically by an image processor and stored on a hard disk of the computer. Usually sequences of 200-300 images are taken. The recording time of one image is 3.6 s (time needed to save one image on the disk). The'real time'resolution, controlled by the beat frequency, is kept in the range of 10 30 prs. It allows the registration of several periods of droplet oscillations in one sequence of images.\n\n2.2. Analys'is o;f the droplet'images As we can observe onl;. the projection of a droplet, we must assume that its shape is convex and axially symmetric with respect to the nozzle axis, and that the axis of svmmetrv is parallel to the plane of observation (i.e. the sensor area of the camera). The three-dimensional form of a droplet is then completely defined by its contour R(0,t). We assume also that a limited number of modes (l-u\") suffrces to describe the deformation of the droplet and that its volume remains constant (incompressible fluid). To fulfll the last condition we have to modify (1), replacing unity by a volume correction term d(ć). This term is a function of time l only. The momentarY description of the droplet surface by Legendre polynomials remains unaffected and is given by r r \\ R(0,t): n.{łttl + f a,(t)P.(cosa)}'\n\n(5)\n\nThe first expansion term is l:2 as / : 0 and I : 1 describe respectively the volumetric pulsation and the translatory motion of the droplet. The value of ó(l) is calculated from the following equation:\n\n#RŻ-zn |, R,(0:t) sin Odd : 0'\n\nJo 3\n\nThe value ofó, in practice, is very close to unity and therefore introduces only a slight modification into (1). However, this correction is needed for a precise determination of the volume of the droplets, which is not known a priori in the experiments. X'or fg1 il. Becker, W.

The accuracy of m\"usured droplet coordinates is directly proportion'al to the resolution of the opiicul system, whicL amounts to one pixel in the image plane' In our experiment's thó droplet images have mean d.iamet,ers of about 250 pixels (t,he format, of the sensor being 7t6 x 53isquare pixels). Owing to the short exposure time (200 ns) the blur due tolhe droplet motion is smaller than one pixel and can be neglected. Thus a single point oflhe image is defined with.an accuracy better than O.5o^. The mean fittńg J,ro. is typically 0.3 pixels for oscillation amplitudes up to az:0.5. Hence, *\" ln\"uy estimaie the error of the measured droplet, radius to be smaller than 0.2oń.\n\nThe other source of possible errors is t'he presence of non-axially symmetric m^odes of oscillation. These *iil appeu, as fluctuations of the droplet radius 'Eo obtained from the fitting procedure and such data are not the subject of further analysis' owing to the high ipatial resolution of the imaging system_even-small changes of the droplet radius due to its evaporation can be observed and measured. In t'he present' experiment with ethan'ol droplets of about 200 pm radius moving in t'he air, the móasured rate of radius con1raction was below 2 x I}_a m/s. It corresponds t,o approximately a 1.5o/o vańation of the oscillation frequency o, during 10ms oL-.errration time. This effect was taken into account when analysing the observed oscillations of the droplets (see Appendix A). The instant of image exposure is determined with an u\"i.r\"u\"y of O.l'/, of the oscillation period of the droplet'\n\nThe experiments were performed with ethanol (95%) (denatured with methyl- ethyl-ketone) as a aroptet medium.

Depóncling on the nat'ure of the applied initial jet disturbance a satellite-droplet *itt -\"tg\" with the following or the leading droplet at some distance from the nozzle. This changes the droplet mass and generates an additional perturbation of its surface. Chaudhary & Maxworthy (1g80) have demonstrated that varying the jet perturbation frequency and amplitude, and adding the third harmonic to the fundamental enables one to control the behaviour of the satellite drops and in some cases effects their elimination. The complete elimination of satellites requires large amplitudes of the jet perturbation whicL initiate stronglv nonlinear oscillations of the generated droplets.\n\nIn the fcrllowing we present results obtained for an oscillating droplet generated at relatively small perturbation amplitude in the presence of a satellite droplet, and a droplet created without a satellite using large perturbation amplitudes with the fundamental frequency accompanied by its third harmonic.  :2,8,4 and 5 respectively. The values of -Bo and a, are obtained from a series of 179 images of the droplet with the help of the fitting procedure described in $2.2. The mean undisturbed radiusło of the droplet. calculated as an arithmetic mean of the values ło, is equal to I77 pm' The droplet is generated at' a relatively small perturbation amplitude of the jet. The input voltage of the jet modulator [/ is equal 1 Vnn. The registration of the droplet oscillations begins shortly after it merges with a satellit\" droplet. The initial amplitude of the second mode (figure 3rł) is about 0.3, whereas the amplitude of the third mode (figure 3ó) is about 3 times smaller. In accordance with (3) the viscous damping becomes stronger with increasing mode number, as can be also seen from figure 3(c,d,), where the higher modes l:4,8 are displayed.\n\nAt first glance, the waveform of the oscillations for / : 2, 3 seems to be that of a damped harmonic oscillator. A more careful analysis, however, reveals small variations of the oscillation period and an asymmetry between the positive (prolate) and negative (oblate) displacements. This type of oscillation may be simulated by introducing into the equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator a restoring force with a symmetric term (i.e. depending on even powers of the displacement). Using an asymptotic expansion for small amplitudes, we obtain the following time- dependent approximation for a,: at(t):'4,sin$'Io,[(I-(a,r,)-,)łłą.,A?]t+l,}+f,A?, (7)\n\nThe amplitude damping is given by A,(t):,4o,exp (-t/r,).\n\n(8)\n\nHere, the term with a, accounts for the amplitude dependence of the oscillation frequency. p, represents the asymmetry of the amplitude ar(t), and Qo is the phase angle. A slight decrease of the droplet radius due to evaporation, observed during longer time sequences, is compensated with help of the normalization function ly'(f) defined in Appendix A (A 1).\n\nThe six free parameters: a7, l3,,,,, ś),, Tt', and,4o, were used to fit (7) and (8) to the measured values of the instantaneous amplitudes a, and au. The fitting procedure is based on the quasi-Newton optimization method mentioned earlier.

For comparison the corresponding values of the linear theory, calculated from (2) and (3) bv inserting measured values of o and lt, are written in brackets.\n\nThe observed weak increase of the oscillation frequency is well described by the parameter ar.

Therefore even a small energy transfer between the funclamental and a higher mode changes appreciably the enórgy balance of the last one.\n\nSummarizing, the asymptotic approximation óquations ( 7) anci ( 8) cannot be applied for the determination of the variation of the frequency of the first few consecutive oscillations after the break-off of the droplet. However, they describe well the asymptotic variation of the frequency of the łundamental mo<le for a 1onq enough series of droplet oscillations. As we mentioned earlier, there exists . p.u.;i;;j demand for a precise determination of the instantaneous values of'surface tensio' using large-amplitude droplet oscillations, and therefore it was necessary to develop a theorctical model taking in account all the nonlinear effects. As a first attempt, th'e full theory of the nonlinear inviscid clroplet oscillations will be described and its features compared with our experimentui fir.dir.g..\n\nAlthough the theoretical analysis of clroplet oscillations for inviscid and irrotational fluid motion is generally of limited applicability for the stucly of real liquids, the usefulness of the invisci<l linear model iór the asymptotic description of the oscillations of low-viscosity droplets justifies our attempt to use an inviscid approximation for the nonlinear modelling. The numerical meihod we use is a least- squares approximation to the kinematic and normal stress boundary conditions. The simple parameterization of the dropret surface (equation ( 5)) allows us a straightforward comparison of numerical results with the experimental data.\n\nWe analyse the motion of a droplet of an inviscid and incompressible liquid in vacuum, or in a gas of negligible density.

Moreover, it can be shown that during oscillations the centre of mass moves forward and backward in our coordinate system.

To keep track of the overall accuracy, the total oscillation energy of the droplet (sum of kinematic and potential one) and all related minimi- zation errors are monitored (see Appendix B). X'or a typical calculation with 300 time steps (two periods of the fundamental mode) the fluctuation of the total energy is below 1%. This calculation requires about 20 minutes CPU time on an IBM 3090- 300E.\n\nThe reliability of the theoretical model was tested by comparing its results with the trajectories published by Lundgren & Mansour (1988), who calculated numerically the nonlinear oscillations of low-viscosity droplets. For this purpose we simulate the initial conditions given by these authors as an example in their paragraph b.1 (p. 499), i.e. a4(t:0) :0.3 and a, u(r:0) : dr_u\\:0) :0. The comparison of the obtained trajectories for the first three even modes (uneven modes are not excited) is displayed in figure 7. The numerical analysis of Lundgren & Mansour, based on the boundary-int'egral method, describes a droplet surface with 101 points. This corresponds to the surface parameterization with a large number of modes. In spite of the fact that our description of the surface displacements is limited to 5 modes, and that the viscous effects are neglected in our calculations, it can be seen that the displayed oscillation trajectories are very similar to those reproduced from their paper. This confirms the adequacy of our model but also suggests that small viscosity effects incorporated in their model are mainly responsible for the amplitude decay and have a relatively small effect on the mode interactions.\n\nTsamopoulos & Brown (1983) and Dtirr & Siekmann (1987) have studied, respectively analytically and numerically, non-viscous droplet oscillations. Both calcula,tions confirm that nonlinearity of the fundamental mode is mainly characterized by a decrease of the oscillation frequency with increasing amplitude. In figure 8 data describing this dependence are recalculated from both papers and compared with those obtained from t'he present calculations and experiments.\n\nAlthough such a comparison has limits, it is worth noticing that all theoretical models predict a very similar dependence of the oscillation frequency on the amplitude, indicating their mutual consistency. The data evaluated from experi- ments (where the viscous damping was responsible for the decrease of the amplitude) are generally below the theoretical values.\n\nThe presented calculations have been carried out for an inviscid liquid. Therefore, to compare quantitatively numerical results with experiment we must limit our attention to a single period of the fundamental mode, during which damping effects ? 0.30 0.15 a20 -0.15 -0.30 0.06 0.03 aB0 -0.03 -0.06 0.06 0.03 a40 -0.03 -0.06 0.04 \\a) 0.02 a50 -0.02 -0.04 0.02 \\D) 0.01 a60 -0.01 -0.02 (d) 036912 Time (Ą) '^i' i;i1i1ffi U) 0.04 (Ć) 5 o.o.l h ^^ĝ r uur ,F o.o1 0 0369rf Time (Ą)\n\nFreunn 9(a-e).

The potential energy of the droplet in equilibrium is set to 0;time unit Ę is defined in the text.\n\nare not too strongly manifested. However, to illustrate nonlinear effects better, we display in figure 9 several periods of the calculated and measurerl oscillations. The numerical calculations in figure 9 are compared with the experimental result's of figure 3. The calculation, performed for physical paramet'ers characterizing the droplet (radius, density and surface tension), begins at to:0.59 ms, defined by the moment when the amplitude a, reaches its first maximum. The initial values of a, ,(t) and rż'_'(lo), evaluated from experimental data, are (0.283' 0.017, 0.015, 0.006) and (0, -0.085' 0.109, -0.061) respectively, whereas au(fo) and rż,u(ło) are taken equal to zero. As we can see, during almost one period of oscillation the calculated trajectories of the deformation amplitude ar(t) agree very well with experimental data. For longer time, owing to damping the discrepancies of the amplitudes begin to be evident. However, both the period of oscillation (or, more aptly, the location of amplitude extrema) and the general form of ar(t) coincide very well with displayed experimental point's. It is also worth noticing the similarities with the experimental data manifested by the higher surface modes a,(l) and an(l). x.or example a,(ź) shows a frequency modulation which appears simultaneously in the experimental and calculated curves. Furthermore, the nonlinear behaviour of on(l) is characterized by an amplitude modulation, which can be observed for both curves in figure 9(c).\n\nSimilarly to the experimental observations, in the calculated oscillations the nonlinear effects become most evident for higher (l > 2) modes.\n\nTo confirm the applicability of the theoretical model for the prediction of the surface tension of the liquid, the surface tension was calculated iteratively. The surface tension defines the characteristic time Ą needed for the calculation of the time derivatives of the initial velocities dr_u(to). We start the calculation at the point where dz: 0 with an arbitrary value of surface tension. Then, the first period of the calculated oscillation trajectory ar(l) is compared with the experimental data and a nerv value of the time unit Ą, hence of the surface tension, is used to calculate the velocities dr-u(td. Repeating successively calculations until the period of ar(l) does not change (three times was sufificient in our case), the final value of the surface tension is found. For the data of figure 3 the surface tension was found to be 22 mNr/m, this is, remarkably, closer to the physical value than the asymptotic estimate of 19 mN/m, obtained for the same data using the linear approximation of equations ( 7) and ( 8).\n\nBoth experimental and analytical results indicate that for amplitudes of the fundamental mode exceeding I0oń of the droplet radius nonlinear effects cannot be neglected in the analysis of droplet oscillations. For short periods, the nonlinear effects observed in our experiments can be well predicted by the proposed inviscid theoretical model, confirming its applicability for prediction of the surface tension from large-amplitude oscillations of low-viscosity droplets.\n\n1.\"\" i^t* o-DI 48 510 511 6If 713 814 914 10 14 l-u\" i.u' o-DI 48 510 511 [612 | 7 13 814 914 10 t4 E(Er) 3.129 x 10 'Ż 3.152 x 10 'Ż 3.187 x 10 'Ż 3.187 x 10 'Ż 3.183 x 10 'Ż 3.182 x 10-' 3.182 x 10 'Ż 3.181 x 10 ': 3.181 x 1O-'Ż max ((X.\",)!) 1.5x10'z 4.6x10 \" łt.6 x 10-3 1.2x103 1.2x10 3 4.3 x 10-o 2.9x10 4 3.1x10 a max(A,E/E) 2.1 xI0 2 3.8 x 10-3 2.7x10 3 2.7 x lO-3 1.2 x 10-3 9.6 x 10-a 7.8x10 1 6.1 x 10-a 5.2xto ą max ((X,\",)!) 2.3 x I0-z 7.8x10 \" 6.1 x10 3 2.1 x 10-3 1.3x10 \" 1.3x10 3 1.7 x 10 3 rnax (ff1\"r) 1.6x10'Ż 3.6x10 3 2.4x IO \" 2.4x10 B 1.1 x 10-3 5.6x104 6.1 x 10-a 3.4x10 a 4.2x10 a CPLT (min) 2 4 6 6.5 10 18 60 80 max ((X.\",)!) max ((X.\",)!) 6.1x10 3 1.1x10 2 1.6x10 3 8.4x10 3 4.6x10 4 2.5x10 3 4.5r l0 a 8.8x l0 a 1.7tl0a 6.2xlOa 1.1x|0ł !'$x|Qa 7.i < l0-5 l.l x lO-a 3.7x105 l.lxl0a 3.7x105 l.Sxl0a\n\nT,r.sr'n 1.
