    "abstract": "Cnidarians, like sponges, are an ancient group, relatively simple in structural organization, wholly aquatic, and most greatly developed in the sea, where they occur from the shore to abyssal depths, both in the plankton and the benthos. At the seashore, cnidarians are confined with few exceptions to lower tidal levels or below because, like the sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians, they are not adapted to withstand exposure. But in contrast to these latter groups, which are mostly all filter feeders, cnidarians are primarily predators. Their success seems to be explained by two devices for food-getting and defense-tentacles and cnidocysts, by an effective means of distribution, the ciliated planula larva, and in many cases (most Scyphozoa, many Hydrozoa) by a free-swimming sexual medusa.",
    "full_text": "Hydrozoa, of which there are roughly 3,000 species (Schuchert 1998), are abundantly represented in the intertidal zone by \"hydroids,\" the sessile polypoid stages of these cnidarians. Hydroids vary tremendously in form, from tiny individuals to large and showy colonies. The life cycles of hydrozoans (plate 38) often include a sexual M E D USA stage, which exists free in the plankton, but even some hydroid colonies exist free-living in the plankton. In the intertidal, the medusa stage is more commonly retained upon the polypoid generation as an attached M E D USOI D or as an even more reduced S POROSAC.\n\nThe existence of free-living medusa stages in some life cycles has led to difficult problems in taxonomy. In many cases, the polyp and the medusa of a single species have been described under different genus and species names, some of which have persisted in common usage even after the two forms have been recognized as stages in the life cycle of one species. We provide separate keys for the attached polypoid, or \"hydroid\" forms, for the hydromedusae, and for the siphonophores. The polyp phase is chiefly encountered in intertidal collecting, while medusae and siphonophores are generally taken in plankton tows or by dip-netting in pools, in harbors around floats, or among Zostera or macroalgae, and all might be collected by snorkeling or scuba diving.\n\nThe hydroids, apparently a nonmonophyletic group, include representatives of the subclasses ANTHOATHECATA (also known as ANTHOMEDUSAE), LEPTOTHECATA (also known as LEP-TOMEDUSAE), and LIMNOMEDUSAE, which account for almost all local species of hydroids and their medusae. Also included among the hydroids are the calcareous \"hydrocorals,\" which are represented intertidally on this coast by one species of the family Stylasteridae, namely the lavender, encrusting Stylantheca porphyra. Subtidally, species of the stylasterid genus Stylaster occur as pink, encrusting and branching growths.\n\nThe anthoathecate family Porpitidae is often abundantly represented on our beaches by the blue \"by-the-wind sailor\" Velella (plate 43A), which may be blown ashore in vast numbers. Its floating hydroid colonies are composed of a series of gastrozooids, gonozooids bearing medusa buds, and dactylozooids surrounding a central mouth.\n\nThe pelagic colonial SIPHONOPHORA are now placed in the pelagic hydromedusae (Bouillon and Boero 2000;Collins 2000Collins , 2002;;Marques 2001;Marques and Collins 2004), but they receive their own key here for ease of identification. Hydromedusan affinities were earlier suggested by Petersen (1979Petersen ( , 1990) ) and Schuchert (1996). Siphonophores have a much more complex organization than other hydromedusae (Totton 1965, Kirkpatrick and Pugh 1984, Pugh 1999, Bouillon et al. 2004). Each colony has a distinct form, size, and arrangement of its members. The colony, which may be supported by a float, forms a complex array of polyps and medusoids specialized for feeding, swimming, reproduction, or other functions. When collected in plankton tows and preserved in formalin, these colonies fragment into bits, on which much of the identification has traditionally been based. Onshore currents and winds carry the floating hydroid Velella, as well as some siphonophores, to our coast, but both are more characteristic of oceanic waters.\n\nThe subclasses NARCOMEDUSAE and TRACHYMEDUSAE consist of hydromedusae that lack a polyp stage in the life cycle; these medusae are occasionally taken in our plankton, but most are essentially oceanic forms. Many of the holoplanktonic siphonophores, narcomedusae, and trachymedusae are considered to be cosmopolitan species. Molecular studies will eventually reveal the amounts of gene flow between animals  Hydroid polyps show considerable polymorphism, and the zooids may be of several different types, named according to their specialized function: nutritive GASTROZOOIDS, generative GONOZOOIDS, or defensive DACTYLOZOOIDS. The term HYDRANTH is used to designate the terminal part of a nutritive zooid but does not include associated perisarcal structures such as the HYDROTHECA. The hydranth is therefore entirely coenosarcal, consisting of the body, hypostome, mouth, and tentacles.\n\nThe term GONOSOME is used to include all the specialized generative zooids of the colony and the perisarcal structures associated with them; the term TROPHOSOME refers to the rest of the colony. In thecate hydroids (such as Obelia), the gonosome includes the asexual generative zooids or BLASTOSTYLES, which produce sexual zooids-MEDUSAE, MEDUSOIDS, or SPOROSACSby budding, together with the GONOTHECAE or cases enclosing the whole set.\n\nThe sexual zooids are termed GONOPHORES by some, or are referred to in general as the \"medusoid\" stage or generation, in contrast to the \"hydroid\" or polyp(oid) stage. However, Fraser (1937) uses gonophore as a synonym of blastostyle, but often includes the budding sexual zooids and the protective theca as well. We and others call this assemblage a GONANGIUM, a term Fraser uses to mean gonotheca. Such a reproductive element of a colony (blastostyle with buds and protective covering, if any) is occasionally still spoken of as a \"fruiting body.\" The term \"gonophore\" is used, therefore, with the most diverse meanings, and we need to know with which of these meanings it is used in each case. Dr. Light remarked that, \"This necessity of using terms whose meanings differ with the author, while annoying for the moment, affords very excellent intellectual experience.\"\n\nThe sexual zooids produce gametes from which, by fertilization, arise zygotes that develop into PLANULA LARVAE. Each larva can give rise to a new individual polyp or hydroid colony (or, in the case of species that do not produce polyps, will develop directly into a new medusa). All the zooids of a given colony are derived from a single zygote; hence the sexual zooids of a colony are clones, all of the same sex, and we speak of the colony as being male or female (in a few cases, colonies are hermaphroditic).\n\nThe generalized hydromedusa (plate 39) is a free-swimming animal consisting of a gelatinous BELL that can range from bellto saucer-shaped with all gradations between. The outer sur-face of the umbrella is known as the EXUMBRELLAR SURFACE, the inner as the SUBUMBRELLAR SURFACE. From the center of the subumbrellar surface hangs the MANUBRIUM, which can be of various lengths and, in some species, is mounted upon a gelatinous PE D U NCLE. The oral opening is terminal on the manubrium. It frequently carries lobes (often spoken of as \"lips\"), frills, or tentacles, all of which are liberally provided with cnidocysts. Where the manubrium joins the bell or peduncle there is usually a gastric cavity. RADIAL CANALS arise from the gastric cavity and course along the bell to the margin, where they join the ring canal. There are usually four radial canals, but other numbers commonly occur (e.g., six, eight, numerous). In a few species the radial canals are branched, while in others CE NTR I PETAL CANALS rise upward from the RING CANAL but may not reach the stomach.\n\nHydromedusae and siphonophores are typically \"craspedote\"that is, they possess a VELUM or membrane that partly closes off the subumbrellar space at the level of the bell margin (plate 39). The velum is occasionally lacking, as in Obelia (plate 38B-38D).\n\nThe bell margin is usually simple and unscalloped. Tentacles usually arise from the bell margin and may be simple, few, or many in number, occurring singly or in groups, or they may be branched (e.g., Cladonema, plate 54F-54I) or rudimentary. The margin may also be provided with specialized sense organs. Chief among these are OCELLI and STATOCYSTS. Ocelli occur as dark pigmented spots, usually one on each tentacle bulb, if present. Statocysts are MARGINAL VESICLES, or open pits, or dangling marginal clubs containing one or more concretions known as STATOLITHS.\n\nMedusae are almost always of separate sexes, although most siphonophores are hermaphrodites. The gonads are epidermal structures on the radial canals, peduncle, or manubrium.\n\nMany of the characteristics customarily used in the classification of hydrozoans are now recognized as varying markedly with environmental conditions and developmental stage, the result of which means that many species should be reexamined and their validity established (e.g., Boero 1987, Widmer 2004). In addition, for many species the complete life cycle is still not known, resulting, as noted above, in a curious double taxonomy in which polyp and medusa of the same animal have been described under separate names. Thus, the polyp originally named Lar is now known to give rise to the hydromedusa Proboscidactyla, and when such life cycles are established, the older name takes precedence. For many species, the polyp is known, but not the medusa, or vice versa.\n\nPositive identification of many hydrozoan polyps cannot be made unless the fixed gonophores or sexually mature medusae associated with them are known. Specimens such as these are presently best keyed out only to genus. Some hydroids, including Proboscidactyla spp. and Cladonema spp., can be identified to species only if their medusae are raised to maturity because the species-distinguishing features lie only in the medusan portion of the life cycle (see both keys in this case for positive identification). Russell (1953), Naumov (1969), Kramp (1961), Millard (1975), Calder (1988Calder ( , 1991Calder ( , 1997)), Cornelius (1995a, b), and Vervoort and Watson (2003) are of particular help for those who wish to pursue the taxonomy of the group.\n\nFor hydromedusae that cannot be identified by the following key, the most useful single reference is Russell (1953). The serious student will also find Kramp (1961) of great assistance because that monograph defines all families and genera of medusae known through 1960 and gives a brief diagnosis of each species. Kramp 1968) are a little less inclusive, but they provide illustrations and keys not found in the 1961 synopsis. Totton (1965), Kirkpatrick and Pugh (1984), and Pugh (1999) are indispensable for detailed study of siphonophores. Although it covers a different geographic region, a monograph on hydrozoa of the Mediterranean by Bouillon et al. (2004) has extensive descriptions of hydroid, hydromedusa, and siphonophore morphology (including a few species present or introduced on the West Coast) and good illustrations; this monograph includes descriptions of many families described in the past 50 years and not in Kramp (1961). Some of these important monographs are now available online at no cost (see \"References\" at the end of this section).\n\nHydrozoans are best examined alive, but it is frequently necessary to anesthetize them. To do so, a solution of magnesium chloride (73.2 g of MgCl 2 • 6 H 2 O per liter of fresh water) is recommended in the proportion of 10-40% added to the water containing the animals. Relaxation will take several minutes. Preservation for general morphological studies should be in 5-10% formalin, which tends to dissolve the statoliths of medusae but leaves the structure of the statocyst intact. For histological work, Bouin's fixative is recommended. Specimens for molecular studies should be preserved in 95% ethanol.\n\nFollowing is a combined glossary containing terms used for hydroid polyps, hydromedusae, and siphonophores. The hydroid polyps selected for inclusion in this key are those species found in the intertidal or the shallow subtidal in our area, or those raised from their medusae in the lab, whose field distribution is unknown. Hydromedusae and siphonophores selected for inclusion in the keys are those found near shore over the same geographic range-note that a few of these species are oceanic but may occasionally drift in from the high seas and have previously been collected in the study area.\n\nIn the unified annotated species list that follows the three keys, we have attempted to integrate the separate taxonomies of hydroid polyps and their medusae. Families used in the species list are a composite, found mostly in Kramp (1961), Totton (1965), Bouillon (1994), Bouillon et al. (2004), and adopted by Cairns et al. (2002).\n\nPlates refer to polyp plates 40-49. . . 8 6.

PUGH HYDROZOA SUBCLASS ANTHOATHECATA (also known as ANTHOMEDUSAE and ATHECATA) ORDER FILIFERA BOUGAINVILLIIDAE Bougainvillia muscus (Allman, 1863). Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Calder, (1988, pp. 24-25). The name replaces B. ramosa (van Beneden, 1844), which is an invalid junior homonym. Probably introduced, present in bays and harbors. Remarkable color illustration of hydroid and medusa from Naples in Brinckmann-Voss 1970, plate 9. *Bougainvillia spp. Hydroid and medusa. Unidentified hydroids of Bougainvillia occur in San Francisco Bay, and may be introduced species. Other Bougainvillia, of the same or different species in Bodega Harbor, have been collected and raised by J. T. Rees and C. E. Mills.\n\nGarveia annulata Nutting, 1901. Hydroid. Hydroids conspicuous, with bright orange to yellow colonies and deeper orange gonophores (Torrey 1902;Fraser 1937;Haderlie et al. 1980-color photograph 3.6, plate 15). Rocky intertidal zones of the open coast, especially in late winter and spring, frequent on sponges and coralline algae; also reported subtidally to 117 m; Alaska to the Channel Islands (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)).\n\nGarveia franciscana (Torrey, 1902) (ϭBimeria franciscana). Hydroid. A robust and conspicuous fouling species, abundant on floats and pilings in areas of low salinity in the San Francisco Bay area. Female gonophores a distinctive blue-purple, with a red-orange spadix. Lower intertidal and shallow subtidal. Reported in harbors from San Francisco Bay to San Diego (Torrey 1902;Fraser 1937Fraser , 1948)). Introduced, but original provenance unknown.\n\nRhizorhagium formosum (Fewkes, 1889). Hydroid. Synonyms in Hochberg and Ljubenkov (1998, p. 9). A small and poorly known species, growing on gastropod shells and other hard substrates. Intertidal to 550 m; San Francisco Bay to Baja California (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998).\n\n*Unidentified bougainvillioid(?). Hydroid and possibly medusa. Hand and Jones (see below) described and illustrated a light, flesh-pink, translucent hydroid collected from 10 m off Point Richmond in San Francisco Bay that underwent curious asexual reproduction involving changes in polarity. The tiny polyps (1-1.5 mm in length) supported four to 12 filiform tentacles inserted in a single cycle at the base of the proboscis. Bavestrello et al. (see below) observed a similar hydroid in the Genoa Aquarium that underwent both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with medusae and which they placed in the superfamily Bougainvillioidea; see Hand and Jones 1957, Biol. Bull. 112: 349-357;Bavestrello et al. 2000, Sci. Mar. 64 (Suppl. 1): 147-150.\n\nBythotiara stilbosa Mills and Rees, 1979. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Known only from newly released medusae collected off docks in Mason's Marina, Bodega Harbor, and raised in the laboratory. Some bythotiarid polyps are symbiotic in tunicates, including Bythotiara huntsmani (Fraser, 1911) in Washington and British Columbia. See Mills and Rees 1979, J. Nat. Hist. 13;285-293. Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 25. Calycopsis nematophora Bigelow, 1913. Medusa (hydroid unknown).

Medusa (hydroid unknown). An oceanic species of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans that is occasionally found near shore.  (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Haderlie et al. 1980-see color photograph 3.7, plate 15).\n\nEudendrium spp. Hydroid. Species of this genus are characterized by typically styloid gonophores, trumpet-shaped hypostomes, and absence of desmonemes in the cnidome. Identification based on gross morphology alone is questionable and should include examination of cnidocysts. Various species of Eudendrium have been reported from the region, but the absence of information on cnidocyst complement makes these identifications uncertain (see Marques et al. 2000a, Zool. Meded., Leiden 74: 75-118;Marques et al. 2000b, J. Zoology, London 252: 197-213).\n\nClava multicornis (Forsskål, 1775) (ϭC. leptostyla L. Agassiz, 1862). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Edwards and Harvey 1975, J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U.K. 55: 879-886. This species is included in the family Hydractiniidae here following Schuchert (2001a); molecular studies show that Clava and hydractiniids should be assigned to the same family. A cold-water species largely inhabiting the intertidal zone of bays and estuaries, sometimes forming large colonies due to stolonal growth. Hydranths and male gonophores pink, those of the female purple. Whether this well-known Atlantic hydroid still occurs in San Francisco Bay (its only known West Coast location) is uncertain.\n\nFirst reported in 1895 from San Francisco Bay (to which it was introduced in ship fouling), it is unclear when it was last seen in the Bay. Light et al. (1954) noted that it was \"abundant on Fruitvale and Bay Farm Island bridges, Oakland, in spring,\" but we find no further actual records in the past 50 years. We did not find it in surveys of San Francisco Bay between 1993 and 2004.\n\nHydractinia armata Fraser, 1940. Hydroid. Female gonophores bearing only a single egg. Found in association with H. milleri (Fraser 1946) Hydractinia milleri Torrey, 1902. Hydroid. Female gonophores bearing only a single egg. Colonies often growing in patches, sometimes covering several square centimeters on rocks exposed to breakers of the open sea (Torrey 1902). British Columbia to central California in the lower intertidal (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Haderlie et al. 1980).\n\n*Hydractinia spp. Hydroid. Additional species of Hydractinia occur in the region (R. Grosberg pers. comm.).  Cordylophora caspia (Pallas, 1771) (ϭC. lacustris Allman, 1844). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 15;2004, p. 346). Hydroids phenotypically variable, in part related to salinity (Roch 1924, Z. Morph. ökol. Tiere 2, 350-426). Eggs develop into planulae within the gonangia (see Schuchert 1996). Restricted to areas of brackish or fresh water. Colonies occurring on a wide variety of substrates including pilings, barnacles, floats, and tubes of the polychaete Ficopomatus; abundant in the San Francisco Bay Delta and recorded in Lake Merced on the San Francisco peninsula. Thought to be Ponto-Caspian in origin, it appears to have a remarkable temperature breadth (if only one species is involved), being introduced in ship fouling from British Columbia to Panama in the shallow subtidal.\n\nTurritopsis sp. Hydroid and medusa. Previously identified from San Francisco Bay as Turritopsis nutricula McCrady, 1857; but from Schuchert's (2004) revision of the genus Turritopsis, it is now evident that there are several similar-looking species, so we do not attempt here a specific identification of this seemingly non-native species. Turritopsis medusae still found occasionally in San Francisco Bay in the late 1990s (these to 8 mm tall, with about 25 tentacles and pale red manubrium), but the hydroid has not been recorded there since 1940; San Francisco Bay, 0-9 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). What was previously seen as a widely introduced single species, usually in estuaries and bays, with affinities to warmer waters in many locations worldwide, has now been identified as at least four species, some or one of which may be quite widely introduced.\n\nSeveral species of Pandeidae have been assigned in the past to Perigonimus, a junior synonym of Bougainvillia (see Calder 1988). These are now referred to genera such as Amphinema, Leuckartiara, Neoturris and Catablema (Bouillon 1985;Calder 1988).\n\nAmphinema platyhedos Arai and Brinckmann-Voss, 1983. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Rare; known from deep water in British Columbia and southern California. Compare with other Amphinema medusae (below) in the area.\n\nAmphinema turrida (Mayer, 1900). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Rare; known from surface waters from Monterey Bay south into Mexico; Pacific and Atlantic. The two stout yellow tentacles and folded gonads that extend most of the way down the radial canals are distinctive. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 26.\n\nAmphinema sp. Hydroid and medusa. Hydranths bright orange-red; when disturbed, they bend over nearly 180º towards the substrate. This hydroid resembles Amphinema rugosum (Mayer 1900) in having medusa buds on the hydrocaulus (Schuchert 1996), but the medusae showed significant differences from A. rugosum. Colony occurred on non-native encrusting bryozoan Watersipora sp. on floating docks in Bodega Harbor. Medusa known only from rearing in the laboratory from field-collected hydroid. See Rees 2000, Sci. Mar. 64 (Suppl. 1): 165-172. Probably introduced.\n\nAnnatiara affinis (Hartlaub, 1913). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Genus name was created by reversal of Tiaranna in which this species was originally placed. A species that has been infrequently collected in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans; considered to live in deep water, but several medusae have been found near the surface in Monterey Bay. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 26. Halitholus spp. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Similar to and usually smaller than Leuckartiara, there are at least two undescribed Halitholus species on our coast. Color photograph in Mills andWrobel 1998 and2003, p. 27.\n\nLeuckartiara octona (Fleming, 1823) (ϭPerigonimus repens [Wright, 1857]). Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 68). Stolonal colonies on shells of gastropods including Hima mendica and Callianax biplicata. Colony form varies according to the host shell and the amount of friction to which it is subjected. The best-developed colonies, sometimes with branches and producing gonophores, are usually found on the upper surface of the shell where there is no abrasion (Torrey 1902;Millard 1975). Alaska to tropics, including San Francisco Bay (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946, as P. repens), as P. repens). L. octona medusae collected in Bodega Bay and Bodega Harbor by Rees (1975). Medusae that meet this description except are two times larger (to 40 mm tall) and with up to 72 tentacular rudiments are sometimes very abundant offshore in central California near Monterey. This species, said to occur all over the world, likely represents a species complex, especially considering its specialized shallowwater habitat association with gastropods.\n\n*Leuckartiara spp. Hydroid and medusa. Other species of Leuckartiara with Perigonimus-like polyps that are not L. octona are occasionally collected in our area. The shape of the apical projection on Leuckartiara and other pandeid species is rather plastic and, tempting though it may be, is not the best diagnostic character to use when trying to make identifications. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 27.\n\nNeoturris breviconis (Murbach and Shearer, 1902). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Known from both the North Pacific and North Atlantic, occurs on the West Coast from the Bering Sea to Monterey Bay. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 28.\n\nNeoturris fontata (Bigelow, 1909). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Medusa collected only once, at the surface near the coast, Baja California (Bigelow 1909, Mem. Mus. Comp. Zool. Harvard 37: 1-243, pls. 1-48; Kramp 1968, p. 49).\n\nNeoturris pelagica (A. Agassiz and Mayer, 1902). Medusa (hydroid unknown). North and South Pacific, including coast of California; rare.\n\nNeoturris sp. (undescribed). Medusa (hydroid unknown) that corresponds more or less to N. pileata (Forsskål, 1775) except for its enormous size (to 80 mm tall, whereas N. pileata [see hydromedusa plate 56G] is described as 40 mm tall) and the very broad, distinctive, tablike diverticula off its radial canals has been collected infrequently offshore in southern California (C. E. Mills, unpublished observations); a record of \"N. pileata\" off Vancouver Island (see Kramp 1968, p. 50) may be the same species.\n\nPandea conica (Quoy and Gaimard, 1827). Medusa (hydroid unknown). With characteristic, usually pointed bell, to 21 mm high, a shelf species perhaps, but occasionally encountered near shore in California; found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean (Kramp 1961(Kramp , 1968). Remarkable color illustration of hydroid and medusa from Naples in Brinckmann-Voss 1970, plate 11.\n\n*Pandea rubra Bigelow, 1913. Medusa (hydroid unknown). A larger (to 75 mm high and wide) flat-topped deep sea species that occurs off California (as well as in the Atlantic and Antarctic) with characteristic deep red gut, gonads, tentacles and subumbrella; unlikely to be found near shore (compare with P. conica) (Kramp 1961(Kramp , 1968).\n\nStomotoca atra L. Agassiz, 1862. Medusa (hydroid unknown). A common near-shore medusa on the entire West Coast that swims in a sinusoidal pattern trailing its two long tentacles, feeding primarily on other small hydromedusae (Mills 1981). Many have attempted to raise its hydroid in the lab: the stolons elongate, but hydranths do not develop (Volker Schmid pers. comm.); the hydroid may be symbiotic on another organism. It is unlikely that our temperate West Coast S. atra is conspecific with the Papua New Guinea medusa of the same name. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 28.\n\nHydroids of the various species of Proboscidactyla strongly resemble each other and are differentiated largely on the basis of medusoid characters (Millard 1975). The family has been classified among the Limnomedusae by several authors (e.g., Kramp 1961;Naumov 1969;Millard 1975;Bouillon 1985Bouillon , 1995a)). Following Petersen (1990), Schuchert (1996), and others, we assign it to the Anthoathecata because of the presence of a stolon system, desmoneme cnidocysts, and the absence of statocysts in the medusae. Gastrozooids in all species of Proboscidactyla are arranged in a circle around the rim of the tube of a sabellid polychaete host. The two tentacles of each hydranth are directed toward the opening of the tube, and the asymmetrically placed pad of cnidocysts on the hypostome is oriented away from it. Polyps are active, securing food from the tentacles of the sabellid or consuming spawned eggs of the host. In bending over periodically towards the central axis of the polychaete tube, with the two tentacles extended and the hypostome resembling a human head, a hydranth resembles a person praying. Nonfeeding polyps sometimes occur some distance from the tube rim. The association of Proboscidactyla spp. with its polychaete substrate is obligatory: planulae settle and develop only on the worm tube (Hand 1954-see below;Millard 1975;Rees 1979-see below).\n\nProboscidactyla circumsabella Hand, 1954. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid found at Pacific Grove, on tubes of the sabellid Pseudopotamilla ocellata (and rarely on P. intermedia), on rocks at low tide; medusae known from Monterey Bay (see Hand andHendrickson 1950, Biol. Bull. 99: 74-87 andHand, 1954, Pacific Sci. 8: 51-67).\n\nProboscidactyla flavicirrata Brandt, 1835. Hydroid and medusa. A northern species occurring from China and Japan to central Oregon, where it is rare. Hydroid known from Friday Harbor commensal on the sabellids Schizobranchia insignis and Pseudopotamilla ocellata. For life cycle, see Hand 1954, Pac. Sci. 8: 51-67 andRees 1979, Can. J. Zool. 57: 551-557; for host specificity and description of larvae settling on sabellid worm tubes, see Campbell 1968, Pac. Sci. 22: 336-339 andDonaldson 1974, Biol. Bull. 147: 573-585; for medusa feeding behavior and diet, see Mills (1981) and Costello and Colin (2002). Photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 38.\n\nProboscidactyla occidentalis (Fewkes, 1889). Hydroid and medusa. Hydroids on tubes of sabellids (Potamilla neglecta and Pseudopotamilla intermedia) from a kelp holdfast, La Jolla, 12-15 m; medusae known from Santa Cruz Island, La Jolla, and San Diego Bay (see Hand 1954, Pac. Sci. 8: 51-67). PROTIARIDAE *Protiara sp. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Two medusae collected in July in Bodega Bay (Rees 1975, p. 252a) and several others collected May through July in Yaquina Bay (1969( -1974, R. J. Larson, personal communication), R. J. Larson, personal communication). The Oregon specimens reached 5 mm in bell height and appear to be an undescribed species (see hydromedusa plate 54E) (R. J. Larson, personal communication).\n\nRathkea octopunctata (M. Sars, 1835). Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 59). Medusa known from Alaska to central California; the miniscule hydroid, seldom seen, is described by Schuchert (1996). The medusae go through a period of asexually producing more medusae from the manubrium walls before sexual gonads develop in the same location. Reported from around the world. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 28.\n\nStylantheca porphyra Fisher, 1931 (ϭAllopora porphyra). Hydroid. Colonies forming vivid purple calcareous encrustations varying in size from tiny patches to large sheets (Haderlie et al. 1980). On exposed, rocky coasts, Monterey Bay and vicinity, low intertidal (Cairns 1983, Bull. Mar. Sci. 33: 427-508 (taxonomy); Alberto Lindner pers. comm.). The commensal polychaete Polydora alloporis forms distinctive paired holes in the colony.\n\n*Stylaster californicus (Verrill, 1866) (ϭAllopora californica). Hydroid. The common sublittoral, branched representative of the alloporas, frequently seen by snorkelers and divers at Carmel, color ranging from orange to pink into purple. See Ostarello 1973, Biol. Bull. 145: 548-564 (natural history); color photograph in Haderlie et al. 1980, 3.17, plate 18. Unpublished molecular work by Alberto Lindner and Steve Blair indicates that this branched form is conspecific with S. porphyra, above, and possibly with other species further north; the S. californicus name has precedence (pers. comm.).\n\nCandelabrum fritchmanii Hewitt and Goddard, 2001. Hydroid. Hydranths large (total body length to 100 mm when relaxed, to Ͻ20 mm when disturbed or contracted), with clasper tentacles attached to developing embryos in the blastostyle-bearing region, at least during the reproductive season. Colony attached to hard substrate by laterally flattened, basal hydrorhiza (this often with short, tentacular processes); naked attachment tentacles with chitinous pads also arise from the hydranth base. Under intertidal boulders in southern Oregon. Feeds on idoteid isopods and small gammarid amphipods; life cycle includes an actinula. See Hewitt and Goddard 2001, Can. J. Zool. 79: 2280-2288. Note: Hand and Gwilliam (1951, J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 41: 206-209) described solitary Candelabrum sp. from Pigeon Point, San Mateo Co., California. These specimens are similar to solitary C. fritchmanii, but owing to their lack of reproductive structures, cannot be specifically identified based on morphological characters alone.\n\nThe medusae of Cladonema are benthic, adhering to substrates by specialized, adhesive tentacles. The hydroids are frequently introduced accidentally to aquaria (Brinckmann-Voss 1970) and * ϭ Not in key.\n\nGRBQ188-2777G-CH10 .qxd 5/3/07 03:48 PM Page 156 Techbooks (PPG Quark) can be kept for long periods (as many as 30 years, Russell 1953, p. 108). The medusae are exceptionally long-lived (several months) for such small species. The taxonomy of the genus is confused (Rees 1979-see below). In coastal California, two groups of species are distinguishable based on the hydroids: Cladonema californicum and C. radiatum (polyps with two whorls of tentacles, one capitate and the other filiform), and Cladonema myersi and C. pacificum (polyps with capitate tentacles only). Two different groups are recognized from the medusae: C. californicum in one, and C. myersi, C. radiatum and C. pacificum in another (Rees 1949-see below;Kramp 1961;Rees 1979Rees , 1982-see below;-see below;Hirohito 1988). A combination of characters thus distinguishes the three species.\n\nCladonema californicum Hyman, 1947 (californica is a misspelling). Hydroid and medusa. For life cycle, see Rees 1979, J. Nat. Hist. 13: 295-302. Medusae present all year clinging to shallow eelgrass or Ulva in bays and harbors (see Hyman 1947, Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 66: 262-268). The medusae feed on benthic fauna associated with eelgrass and seaweed, capturing prey passively while remaining attached to the plants, but they swim actively when disturbed. Medusa found from British Columbia to Long Beach; hydroid known from Bodega Harbor. For lab culture, feeding, carbon, and nitrogen budgets, see Costello 1988, J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 123: 177-188;Costello 1991, Mar. Biol. 108: 119-128;Costello 1998, J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 225: 13-28. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 29.\n\nCladonema myersi Rees, 1949. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroids on coralline algae; can be kept in aquaria for long periods (see Rees 1949, Proc. Zool. Soc. London 119: 861-865). Described from La Jolla, where the hydroid, releasing medusae, was found in 1934.\n\nCladonema pacificum Naumov, 1955(ϭC. uchidai Hirai, 1958; see Hirohito 1988 for its complex taxonomic history). Hydroid and medusa. Found in display tank at the University of California, Berkeley, with material in the tank from San Francisco Bay and presumed to occur there (Rees 1982, Pac. Sci. 36: 439-444). Originally described from the Sea of Japan. An introduction from east Asia (Rees 1982 above).\n\nCladonema radiatum Dujardin, 1843. Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 131). European species common amongst the eelgrass Zostera in Padilla Bay, Washington, adjacent to oil refineries on March Point, and likely to occur elsewhere on the West Coast because of frequent tanker traffic to refineries up and down the West Coast. Spectacular color illustration of hydroid and medusa in Brinckmann-Voss 1970, plate 5. Introduced.\n\nCorymorpha palma Torrey, 1902. Hydroid. Synonyms in Hochberg andLjubenkov (1998, p. 13). We follow Petersen (1990) and Schuchert (1996) in assigning this species to Corymorpha. In being an easy species to cultivate in the laboratory, aspects of its behavior, developmental biology, associations with algae, and statocysts have been investigated (see Haderlie et al. 1980 andHochberg andLjubenkov 1998, for references;color photograph in Haderlie et al., 3.4, P15). A southern species ranging at least north to Santa Barbara Channel, lower intertidal to 60 m; occurring where currents are moderate in turbid bays and estuaries, and on muddy bottoms offshore (Fraser 1937;Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998).\n\nEuphysa spp. Hydroid and medusa. A group of boreal (North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic) species that are commonly found as far south as Washington and occasionally are col-lected at least to central Oregon (R. J. Larson unpublished observations). Discussion of synonomies and northeast Pacific species in Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980: 6-9). Euphysa tentaculata medusae have only three tentacles at maturity (4-6 mm bell height); E. flammea and E. japonica both have four tentacles at maturity (about 1 cm tall) and are indistinguishable at that point. E. flammea has only one tentacle in the young stages, whereas E. japonica has four already at very small size. Some species of Euphysa, including E. ruthae near Friday Harbor, have interstitial polyps (see Norenburg and Morse 1983, Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 102: 1-17). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 31.\n\nEuphysora bigelowi Maas, 1905. Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Hochberg and Ljubenkov (1998, p. 16). Hydroid raised in lab from mature medusae collected in Monterey Bay (see Sassaman and Rees 1978, Biol. Bull. 154: 485-496). Typical of species of this family, the oral tentacles not distinctly capitate but may be thickened at their tips, especially in young polyps (Sassaman and Rees 1978;Petersen 1990). Hydroid generally found on soft bottoms, anchoring rootlets with inflated tips being used for attachment. Reproducing asexually with part of the base of the parental polyp detaching, developing tentacles, and breaking free (Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998). Period of medusa liberation prolonged due to asynchronous development of the gonophores (Sassaman and Rees 1978). Assigned to Corymorpha by Sassaman and Rees (1978), Petersen (1990), andCairns et al. (2002), but we refer it to Euphysora (Kramp 1961(Kramp , 1968;;Hochberg andLjubenkov 1998, Bouillon et al. 2004). Indo-Pacific and Mediterranean. *Unidentified corymorphid. A tiny (2-3 mm), orange-tinted polyp (see hydroid plate 44J), similar to the European Corymorpha nutans M. Sars 1835 collected from soft mud at Point Richmond in 1955 by Meredith Jones and again (if the same species) by James Carlton in Lake Merritt, Oakland, in 1967 (Cohen and Carlton 1995, p. 33).\n\nCoryne eximia Allman, 1859 (ϭSyncoryne eximia). Hydroid and medusa. Additional synonyms in Schuchert (2001b, p. 773). Hydroid easily kept in laboratory. See Schuchert (2001b) for differences between hydroid and medusa stages of C. eximia and C. japonica. Rocky intertidal and subtidal zones, Alaska to Monterey Bay, 0-18 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). Some reports of C. eximia could be C. cliffordi (Brinckmann-Voss 1989), a similar species known only from British Columbia (Schuchert 2001b).\n\nCoryne japonica (Nagao, 1962) (ϭStauridiosarsia japonica). Hydroid and medusa. Additional synonyms in Schuchert (2001b, p. 757). Known from Bodega Harbor and adjacent outer coast (Rees 1975); North and South Pacific, intertidal and shallow subtidal, on rocks and shells. See Arai and Brinckmann-Voss 1980;Schuchert 2001b.\n\nCoryne sp. (undescribed). Hydroid and medusa. Large showy unbranched colonies of polyps (to 6 cm tall) growing on floating wood nearly always within 2-3 cm of the surface at Alameda Point, eastern shore of San Francisco Bay; large hydranths bear as many as 80 medusa buds at one time. Medusae grown in culture to maturity in 2 to 3 weeks, distinguished by bubblelike vesicles on the exumbrella (J. T. Rees unpublished observations). Probably an introduced species that is either undescribed or yet to be matched to a known species elsewhere in the world.\n\nDipurena bicircella Rees, 1977. Hydroid and medusa. Larger, mature polyps occurring at center of colony; smaller polyps with fewer or no medusa buds at periphery. Adult medusae sluggish swimmers, spending most of their time on the bottom in culture. On granite rock and shell, 3-10 m in Horseshoe Cove, Bodega Head (Rees 1977, Mar. Biol. 39: 197-202). See Schuchert (2001b) for comparison with other species of Dipurena. Dipurena ophiogaster Haeckel, 1879. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid (see hydroid plate 42F) grows on algae, barnacles and rock in Europe (see Schuchert 2001b, p. 803). Medusae with three or four gonads on the manubrium (McCormick 1969a, b; R. J. Larson unpublished observations) identified as D. ophiogaster in Yaquina Bay; and medusae without description identified as D. ophiogaster? in Bodega Harbor (Rees 1975, p. 252a), but this medusa is easily confused with D. reesi. D. ophiogaster is known from a variety of locations in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (see Schuchert 2001b). Dipurena reesi Vannucci, 1956. Hydroid and medusa. Barely detectable hydroid (see hydroid plate 42G) grows on rock and shell in Europe (see Schuchert 2001b, p. 805). Medusa reported from southern California and Mexico (known also from Brazil, Mediterranean and Bay of Biscay). Difficult to distinguish from D. ophiogaster (see Schuchert 2001b).\n\nSarsia tubulosa (M. Sars, 1835). Hydroid and medusa. As Syncoryne mirabilis (Agassiz, 1862) in Torrey (1902) and Fraser (1911Fraser ( , 1937Fraser ( , 1946)), but that name, originally used for a medusa from New England, appears to have been applied to a complex of corynid species and is best not used for West Coast material pending further studies. In bays and harbors, Alaska to southern California, 0-22 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). Identifications questionable due to many similar species; see Miller 1982, J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 62: 153-172 (species of Friday Harbor, including S. tubulosa), but see also Schuchert (2001b) for critical discussion and synonomies. Medusa feeding behavior and diet reported by Costello and Colin (2002) may represent more than one species, which may or may not be S. tubulosa. Present in San Francisco Bay in 2000 (J. T. Rees unpublished collection); likely introduced. *Sarsia spp. and Coryne spp. Species of Sarsia and Coryne are difficult to identify because of a lack of morphological characters (Brinckmann-Voss 1985, Can. J. Zool. 63: 673-681;Schuchert 2001b). Two unnamed species of the \"Sarsia/Coryne eximia\" group occur in our area, Coryne sp. A and B (Rees 1975). The \"eximia\" group, now referred to Coryne, comprise medusae with a short manubrium; the \"tubulosa\" group, now referred to Sarsia, include medusae with a long manubrium. Rees (1975) reports at least five unidentified species of \"Sarsia\" (includes Coryne by present generic definitions) present in the plankton in Bodega Bay. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 29.\n\nThis family was assigned to the Order Filifera (Bouillon 1985) prior to life-cycle studies. The hydranths have capitate tentacles (Mills and Miller 1987;Wrobel and Mills 1998;Mills 2000), indicating that the Halimedusidae should be assigned to the Capitata (Mills 2000).\n\nHalimedusa typus Bigelow, 1916. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid reared in the laboratory. Hydranths feed on nematodes and rotifers; their solitary condition and minuteness make them inconspicuous in nature (see Mills 2000, Sci. Mar. 64 [Suppl. 1]: 97-106). Medusae occur at least in Yaquina Bay, Coos Bay, Humboldt Bay, and Bodega Bay and Bodega Harbor. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 26. Rees, Hand and Mills, 1976. Hydroid and medusa. Polyps with large hydranths (0.5-6.0 cm high, depending on state of contraction); these move with the current, swinging like maces through the water and along the substrate, quickly contracting when disturbed. They feed on relatively large (2-4 mm) gammarid amphipods and other macrobenthic crustaceans (see Rees et al. 1976, Wasmann J. Biol. 34: 108-118). Intertidal and subtidal on jetty at entrance to Bodega Harbor, on rock faces exposed to moderately strong water movements; occasionally on kelps; medusa in Bodega Harbor and Bodega Bay.\n\nClimacocodon ikarii Uchida, 1924. Hydroid and medusa. An oceanic species, with hydroids free-living in the plankton; occasionally collected near shore in central California and central Oregon. Polyps highly differentiated, budding medusae, which are released but do not grow much beyond 2 mm, making them among the smallest of the hydromedusae (see Uchida 1924, Japanese J. Zool. 1: 59-65).\n\nMoerisia sp. Hydroid and medusa. Although this species was assigned to Moerisia lyonsi Boulenger, 1908 by Cairns et al. (2002), both the medusa and polyp in California have certain substantial differences from that species, as noted by Rees and Gershwin (2000), which prevent a positive species identification. It may also be conspecific with material from the Chesapeake Bay region identified as M. gangetica Kramp, 1958 by Petersen (1990). A study of variability in Moerisia is needed: if a single species, it is highly morphologically variable. Hydroid found on floats in low-salinity rivers and sloughs feeding into San Francisco Bay, reproducing asexually several ways, including frustulation and formation of podocysts, from which hydranths arise. Hydranth tentacles appear filiform but are moniliform, sometimes with a slightly capitate tip. Hydroids of this species, from the Petaluma River in San Francisco Bay, were incorrectly assigned to Maeotias by Mills and Sommer (1995); found in same location during 2004 on tubes of the polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus. PENNARIIDAE *Pennaria disticha Goldfuss, 1820 (ϭHalocordyle disticha, ϭPennaria tiarella [Ayres, 1854]). Hydroid and ephemeral medusa (see hydromedusa plate 52J), which sometimes release their gametes without ever being released from the hydroid colony, other times swim freely for a few hours (Mayer 1910). Reported from San Francisco Bay as Pennaria tiarella by Fraser (1937) without a collection date; then reported as Pennaria sp. on fouling panels at Mare Island, SF Bay, in 1944-1947; no further records (Cohen and Carlton 1995, Appendix 2, p. 1). See hydroid plate 52J, 52K. La Jolla; rare. See Rees and Larson 1980, Can. J. Zool. 58: 2089-2095 (morphological variation). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 30.\n\nPolyorchis penicillatus (Eschscholtz, 1829). Medusa (hydroid unknown; see Brinckmann-Voss 2000, Sci. Mar. 64 [Suppl. 1]: 189-195 for retraction of discovery of \"polyp of P. penicillatus\"). Medusae found from Aleutian Islands to Sea of Cortez, primarily in protected bays. Once locally abundant throughout their range, they have disappeared or substantially decreased in numbers in the past several decades from highly urbanized or otherwise developed areas, especially in California. Medusae feed both in the water column and on the bottom, spending much of their time perched on their tentacles on the sea floor (Mills 1981). See Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980) and Rees and Larson 1980, Can. J. Zool. 58: 2089-2095 for morphological variability and discussion of the synonymy between P. montereyensis Skogsberg, 1948 and P. penicillatus. A number of scientists have devoted many hours to trying to culture the polyp of this charismatic species, with no success, leading us to imagine that it is likely symbiotic on or in some other organism. Newly released medusae, 1-2 mm in diameter, occur for example around marina floats heavily coated with fouling organisms in San Francisco Bay and Bodega Harbor and above a mud-bottom with abundant eelgrass and common infaunal bivalves, suggesting that a cryptic polyp is frustratingly close by. See Gladfelter 1972, Helgol. wiss. Meeresunters. 23: 38-79 (locomotor system); Haderlie et al. 1980 (general review, literature, see color photograph 3.8, plate 16, as P. montereyensis). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 30.\n\nScrippsia pacifica Torrey, 1909. Medusa (hydroid unknown). These magnificent medusae are usually born in mid-winter, reaching adulthood in the summer months, when they are occasionally seen in large numbers in central California bays, at the surface or washed up on ocean beaches. They have been seen offshore on the bottom from about 20 m in La Jolla (by scuba divers) to as deep as 367 m in Monterey Bay (by ROV); their range is from northern California to Baja California. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 30.\n\nVelella velella (Linnaeus, 1758). Hydroid and medusa. \"Bythe-wind sailor.\" Colonies polymorphic, deep blue, floating on the sea surface worldwide. Occasionally washed ashore across the region (massive strandings can be from British Columbia to central California) in large numbers, spring and summer (Alvariño 1971; Arai and Brinckmann-Voss 1980, and earlier papers by Edwards, Mackie, and others, cited therein). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 31. Although released from the floating hydroid in copious numbers, the medusae are rarely collected in the field.\n\nProtohydra leuckarti Greeff, 1868. Hydroid only. Microscopic solitary polyp known mostly from Europe, with occasional sightings elsewhere including Puget Sound (1950s-see Wieser 1958, Pac. Sci. 12: 106-108;1970s and2005, C. E. Mills and E. N. Kozloff unpublished observations). This tentacleless hydroid (see plate 49R, 49S) is less than 1 mm in length and occurs in organically rich, sandy mud or mats of algae in brackish water and feeds on nematodes, harpacticoid copepods, and ostracodes. It is likely to be found elsewhere on the Pacific coast as interstitial meiofauna in the low intertidal, a community that has rarely been closely investigated in our region.\n\nHybocodon prolifer L. Agassiz, 1862. Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 113). Hydroid with stolons often buried in sponges. Hydranths pink. Although solitary, several polyps may occur together; branched hydrocauli observed under cultivation (Petersen 1990;Schuchert 1996). Medusae with asymmetrical umbrella produce additional medusae from the one well-developed tentacle bulb; the same individuals later reproduce sexually, at which time eggs develop into actinulae, still attached to the manubrium. Medusa incorrectly recorded as \"Sarsia prolifer\" in Yaquina Bay (Mc-Cormick 1969a, b).\n\nPinauay crocea (L. Agassiz, 1862) (ϭEctopleura crocea, ϭTubularia crocea). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Schuchert (1996, p. 107), genus Pinauay proposed by Marques and Migotto 2001, Pap. Avulsos Zool. (São Paulo) 41( 25): 465-488, leading to the sequential (as it passed through Ectopleura) demise of one of the most well-known names (Tubularia crocea) in the hydroid and fouling literature. Pinauay, which means \"water palm tree\" in the pre-Columbian Tupi language of Brazil (because this hydroid, like the other \"Tubularias,\" looks like a palm tree underwater), is pronounced \"pin-áw-wa-i.\" A primary fouling species with a wide distribution, mainly in estuaries (Torrey 1902;Petersen 1990). Colonies forming conspicuous clusters on pilings and floats in bays and harbors. Gulf of Alaska to southern California, low tide to 40 m (Fraser 1937;Haderlie et al. 1980-see color photograph 3.3, p. 14). Introduced on ship bottoms from the North Atlantic.\n\nPinauay marina (Torrey, 1902) (ϭEctopleura marina, ϭTubularia marina). Hydroid. Colonies on the lee side of rocks exposed to breakers on the open seacoast; active during winter (Haderlie et al. 1980-see color photograph 3.2, plate 14). More delicate and sparse than P. crocea. British Columbia to California, lower intertidal to 37 m (Torrey 1902;Fraser 1937;Petersen 1990).\n\nTubularia harrimani Nutting, 1901. Hydroid. Characterized by having well-developed tentacles on the gonophores. Alaska to Monterey Bay (Fraser 1937). Sometimes found at Pescadero Point, on Monterey Peninsula before 1954 (Light et al. 1954, p. 32); present status in our area unknown.\n\nZanclea bomala Boero, Bouillon and Gravili, 2000. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid on unidentified bryozoan, with reticulate hydrorhiza growing under the bryozoan skeleton. Medusae released with two tentacles, but mature with four tentacles. Bodega Harbor, shallow water. See Boero et al. 2000, Italian J. Zool. 67: 93-124. There are scattered records of Z. costata Gegenbauer, 1856 in central California, including Rees (1975), who reports collecting a \"Z. costata\" medusa in a plankton tow in Bodega Harbor and also a zancleid polyp on floating docks in Bodega Harbor on a Membranipora colony, and a note from Ralph Smith that Z. costata is found \"on pink bryozoa under boulders, Schuster's Rock (Doran Beach). In their zancleid review, Boero et al. caution that Z. costata is known with certainty only from the Mediterranean and that all other records must be confirmed by a study of the cnidocysts. Since two zancleids have now been described from Bodega Harbor, both associated with bryozoans, we remove Z. costata from our species list until GRBQ188-2777G-CH10 .qxd 5/3/07 03:48 PM Page 159 Techbooks (PPG Quark)\n\nsuch time as its presence on the West Coast is verified. Young Z. bomala medusae are nearly identical to those of Z. costata.\n\nZanclella bryozoophila Boero and Hewitt, 1992. Hydroid and medusa. Originally in Zanclella, synonymized with Zanclea (Schuchert 1996, p. 93), separated out again by Boero et al. (2000-see entry above). Hydroid epizoic on the bryozoan Schizoporella in shallow subtidal and protected by the bryozoan surface. Believed to feed on material gathered by the bryozoan lophophore. Diet microphagous, with hypostome and tentacles causing no retraction of the host's lophophores. Medusae, released with mature gonads, live only a few hours, sometimes spawning without actually being released from parent hydroid. Known only from the north jetty of Bodega Harbor. See Boero and Hewitt 1992, Can. J. Zool. 70: 1645-1651.\n\nORDER CONICA AEQUOREIDAE There seem to be at least two species of Aequorea on the West Coast of North America; a variety of names are available, and final identification awaits molecular genetic studies. The name Aequorea victoria (below) was assigned to the smaller, common, nearshore representative of the two obvious species by Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980), but this species, the source of both green-fluorescent protein (GFP) and aequorin, a bioluminescent protein, has also been called A. aequorea and A. forskalea in the literature. A much larger species of Aequorea is more oceanic off Washington, Oregon, and California, but nearshore in Alaska. These large offshore individuals in California, which occasionally make it to the coastline, seem to agree with A. coerulescens (below). They may or may not be the same as those in Alaska designated A. aequorea var. albida by Bigelow (1913, Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus. 44: 1-119).\n\nAequorea ?coerulescens (Brandt, 1835). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Very large Aequorea with large numbers of radial canals occasionally occur along the West Coast; these seem to be referable to this species, which was originally described from the open ocean 35°N, 144°W. This name is also used for some Aequorea medusae in Japan.\n\nAequorea victoria (Murbach and Shearer, 1902). Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid known mostly from lab culture (Strong 1925, Publ. Puget Sound Biol. Station 3: 383-399), where it grows easily. Medusae from Alaska to California, less abundant off Oregon and California than in Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington. This medusa was the source of the now laboratoryproduced luminescent and fluorescent proteins aequorin and GFP. The taxonomy of this species remains confusing: A victoria may or may not be conspecific with A. aequorea (Forsskål 1775) and/or A. forskalea Péron and Lesueur, 1809 (see http://fac-ulty.washington.edu/cemills/Aequorea.html). For medusa feeding behavior and diet, see Costello and Colin (2002). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 32. Torrey, 1904. Hydroid. Colonies small (35-40 mm), delicate, on algae. A southern species occuring as far north as Oregon, 0-154 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). *Aglaophenia latirostris Nutting, 1900. Hydroid (see hydroid plate 44E, 44F). Common on rocks and large red and brown algae from the low intertidal to 35 m, this species shares the common name \"ostrich plume hydroid\" with A. stuthionides. These robust hydroids are frequently seen cast ashore on beaches after storms. A. latirostris may have prominent reproductive structures called corbulae, containing the reduced meduoids (see color photograph in Haderlie et al. 1980, 3.15, plate 18); if ripe, these will produce planulae readily when left in the sun for approximately an hour (Light et al. 1954, p. 33). Fraser (1937Fraser ( , 1948) ) recorded it from San Pedro, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco Bay, with an overall range from British Columbia to Central America, Aglaophenia struthionides (Murray, 1860). Hydroid. Synonyms in Fraser (1937, p. 180). This is a large (about 6.5 cm), conspicuous species in the lower intertidal and shallow subtidal, sometimes known as the \"ostrich plume hydroid,\" a common name that it shares with A. latirostris. Exposed rocky shores. Alaska to southern California, low tide to 160 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). Haderlie et al. 1980 note that the nudibranch Dendronotus subramosus \"often occurs on and closely resembles this hydroid in appearance\"; see also color photograph 3.14, plate 18 (Haderlie et al. 1980).\n\n*Aglaophenia epizoica Fraser, 1948. Hydroid. A subtidal species, with large colonies (20 cm or more) and long corbulae. Abundant in the Channel Islands region (see Fraser 1948). A wealth of material of this species exists in collections from Allan Hancock Pacific Expeditions at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Santa Barbara to Baja California, 15-150 m. *Aglaophenia spp. Hydroid. Several other species of this genus have been reported from our region. See Fraser (1937Fraser ( , 1948) ) for records, and Cairns et al. (2002) for names. Mayer, 1910. Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid colonies tiny (0.5 mm tall), in brackish waters; on introduced Atlantic barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, attached to floats in rivers and sloughs feeding into San Francisco Bay. Medusae collected in tributaries to San Francisco Bay and Coos Bay (Mills and Rees 2000). Introduced, original provenance perhaps Ponto-Caspian; earliest collections on the West Coast are of medusae in the Napa and Petaluma Rivers in 1970 and 1974 (as \"Phialidium,\" which they closely resemble).\n\nCalycella syringa (Linnaeus, 1767). Hydroid. Synonyms in Cornelius (1995a, p. 186). A stolonal epibiont on stems of other hydroids (e.g., Tubularia, Hydrallmania, Lafoea), as well as algae and similar substrates (Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998). Tolerant of brackish water (Cornelius 1995a). Alaska to Baja California, intertidal to 300 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998). [Calicella Hincks, 1861 is not the same as Calycella Hincks, 1864, but it is instead a junior synonym of Lafoea Lamouroux, 1821; the specific name syringa has occasionally been combined with the genus Calicella in error.] * ϭ Not in key.\n\nGRBQ188-2777G-CH10 .qxd 5/3/07 03:48 PM Page 160 Techbooks (PPG Quark) EIRENIDAE Eirene mollis Torrey, 1909. Medusa (hydroid unknown). This West Coast species is rarely reported, possibly because it is easily overlooked among the similar, but much more abundant Eutonina indicans (as noted by Arai and Brinckmann-Voss, 1980). Its range is at least British Columbia to San Diego.\n\nEutonina indicans (Romanes, 1876). Hydroid and medusa. North Pacific and North Atlantic; Bodega Harbor, on Zostera, crabs, and rocks, shallow water (see Rees 1978, Wasmann J. Biol. 36: 201-209). Operculum sometimes shed in older colonies (Cornelius 1995a). Medusae abundant in summer plankton and may litter ocean beaches where the gelatinous peduncle shows up as a colorless, nipplelike piece of jelly. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 33. It seems possible that the rarely reported Eutimalphes brownei medusa of Torrey (1909) (collected at that time in substantial numbers in San Diego Bay) is a junior synonym of E. indicans.\n\nHalecium spp. Hydroid. Several species of this diverse and difficult genus, including Halecium annulatum Torrey, 1902, H. corrugatum Nutting, 1899, and H. kofoidi Torrey, 1902 have been reported from our area. Identification is difficult or impossible unless gonophores are present. See Fraser (1937Fraser ( , 1946) ) for accounts, and Cairns et al. (2002) for nomenclature.\n\nAntennella avalonia Torrey, 1902. Hydroid. Synonyms in Schuchert (1997 [see below], p. 18). This species is considered to be of doubtful validity; possibly conspecific with the more cosmopolitan A. secundaria (Gmelin, 1791) by Schuchert (1997, Zool. Verh. Leiden 309: 1-162), but could also be a California regional species. Santa Catalina Island and southward, 4-64 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)).\n\nMonostaechas quadridens (McCrady, 1859). Hydroid. Synonyms in Hirohito (1995, pp. 249, 251) and Schuchert (1997, p. 130). A warm-water species, sometimes epizoic on other hydroids. San Francisco Bay and southward, 5-84 m (Fraser 1946(Fraser , 1948)).\n\nKirchenpaueria plumularioides (Clark, 1877) (ϭPlumularia plumularioides). Hydroid. Specific name misspelled plumularoides in Fraser (1937Fraser ( , 1946)). Small colonies (30 mm), growing in clusters, lacking lateral nematothecae. Bering Sea to San Diego, intertidal to 46 m (Fraser 1946).\n\n*Filellum serpens (Hassall, 1848). Hydroid. Alaska to San Diego, from low tide to160 m (Fraser 1937); also reported from the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans (Cairns et al. 2002).\n\n*Lafoea dumosa (Fleming, 1820). Hydroid. Alaska to San Pedro, from low tide to 110 m (Fraser 1937); also reported from the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans (Cairns et al. 2002).\n\nLaodicea sp. Hydroid and medusa. Occasional medusae referable to the genus Laodicea have been collected in our area (Rees 1975(Rees , p. 2523b)). Their specific identification is not known; the polyp of L. undulata is shown in Russell (1953, p. 238).\n\nPtychogena californica Torrey, 1909. Medusa (hydroid unknown). San Diego to the Bering Sea; possibly a young stage of P. lactea (see Arai and Brinckmann-Voss 1980, p. 83).\n\nPtychogena lactea A. Agassiz, 1865. Hydroid and medusa. San Diego to the Bering Sea, Arctic. Naumov (1969, p. 322) ascribes a deep water hydroid (250-520 m) to this species because they have the same general distribution. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills, 1998 and2003, p. 33.\n\nEucheilota bakeri (Torrey, 1904) (ϭClytia bakeri). Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid with stalks to 12 cm tall, epizoic on live gastropod and bivalve shells on sandy beaches, lower intertidal to subtidal; the small medusae sometimes abundant in near-shore plankton, San Francisco to Baja California, surf zone to more than 70 m (Fraser 1937;Haderlie et al. 1980, see color photograph of hydroid 3.9, p16, as Clytia bakeri).\n\nMelicertum octocostatum (M. Sars, 1835). Hydroid and medusa. North boreal circumpolar nearshore species occasionally collected as medusae as far south as central Oregon. Further studies may restore the similar West Coast species M. georgicum A. Agassiz, 1862, which has been given junior synonym status by recent authors (Brinckmann-Voss and Arai 1980). Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 33. Hydroid described in Russell (1953, p. 250), but not yet collected on West Coast.\n\nFoersteria purpurea (Foerster, 1923). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Rare, possibly deep-water species, known only from British Columbia, where it occurs just off the bottom, and central California, where it has occasionally been found at the surface in Monterey Bay. Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 34. Mitrocoma cellularia (A. Agassiz, 1865). Hydroid and medusa. The hydroid has been raised in the laboratory (Widmer 2004), but is not known from the field; it resembles those assigned to the catch-all genus Cuspidella. The medusae are found from the Bering Sea to southern California, from near shore to deep water (see Raskoff 2000, Scientia Marina, 64 [Suppl. 1]: 151-155); for feeding behavior and diet see Costello and Colin (2002). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 34.\n\nPhialella fragilis (Uchida, 1938). Hydroid and medusa. Hydroid on mussels (Mytilus) on floating docks, with colonies best developed near edge of the shell beside the inhalant and exhalant currents. Occasionally on the same shells as P. zappai and having similar ecological requirements. Medusa to 10 mm. Rarely collected; known only from Japan and Bodega Harbor (Boero 1987). Possibly introduced.\n\nPhialella zappai Boero, 1987. Hydroid and medusa;Phialella sp. in Boero (1987) and Phialella n. sp. in Rees (1975) are P. zappai (F. Boero pers. comm.). Hydroid on mussels (Mytilus) on floating docks and difficult to distinguish from P. fragilis without raising the medusae. Medusae to about 7 mm. Known only from Bodega Harbor. Named after Nando Boero's favorite musician, Frank Zappa, which afforded an entrée to a friendship between the two men (http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andy murkin/Resources/MusicRes/ZapRes/jellyfish.html).\n\nPlumularia goodei Nutting, 1900. Hydroid. Small hydroids (25 mm), on shore and near-shore rocks; British Columbia to southern California (Fraser 1946).\n\nPlumularia lagenifera Allman, 1885. Hydroid. Synonyms in Millard (1975, p. 392). Colonies to 5-10 cm high. Widely distributed in San Francisco Bay (Fraser 1937); found at Pier 39, San Francisco in 2004, and occurs all along the West Coast from the intertidal to offshore waters (Alaska to the tropics, 0-146 m) (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)).\n\nPlumularia setacea (Linnaeus, 1758). Hydroid. Synonyms in Cornelius (1995, p. 158). Life cycle information in Hughes 1986, Proc. R. Soc. (B) 228 ( 1251): 113-125. An abundant species in our region, substrate generalist; colony to 5 cm high locally; form varied, especially in epizoic colonies (Millard 1975). Recorded from boreal to tropical waters in the Eastern Pacific (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)), the name setacea is applied worldwide and probably involves a multispecies complex.\n\nAbietinaria filicula (Ellis and Solander, 1786). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 99) and Cornelius (1995b, p. 27). Species believed to have retreated northwards in Europe over the past 150 years (Cornelius 1995). Different forms have been described (Naumov, 1969). Colonies usually less than 10 cm high. Known south to San Francisco Bay, on intertidal rocks to 66 m (Torrey, 1902;Fraser, 1937Fraser, , 1946)); genetic comparisons to Atlantic populations would be of interest to determine if this is indeed the same species.\n\nAbietinaria greenei (Murray, 1860). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 99). Colonies in clusters, to 3 cm high. A northern species occurring south to Monterey Bay, intertidal to 37 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)).\n\nAbietinaria inconstans (Clark, 1876). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 99). Synonyms in Fraser (1937) include A. amphora Nutting, 1904and A. costata Nutting, 1901. Colonies to 4 cm high, with thick stem. Alaska to Mexico, including San Francisco Bay, intertidal to 313 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946, as A. amphora), as A. amphora).\n\nAbietinaria traski (Torrey, 1902). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 99) andHirohito (1995, p. 156). Abundant in parts of its range and conspicuous because of the symmetry and whiteness of its colonies (Fraser 1946). Colonies pinnate, to 6 cm high. Alaska to Baja California, 10-400 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998).\n\nAmphisbetia furcata (Trask, 1857) (ϭSertularia furcata). Hydroid. Synonyms in Fraser (1937, p. 162). Colonies small (8 mm), common on algae, surfgrass, and shore rocks, in large patches (Fraser 1946). British Columbia to southern California and southward to the tropics, intertidal to 82 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). See color photograph in Haderlie et al.,3.11,plate 17 as Sertularia furcata.\n\nDynamena disticha (Bosc, 1802) (ϭDynamena cornicina auct., ϭSertularia cornicina auct.). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 108) andHirohito (1995, pp. 167, 170). Colonies small (15 mm), unbranched; a warm-water species occurring north to San Francisco Bay in shallow waters (Fraser 1937, 1946, as Sertularia cornicina). This is another \"global\" species name, with numerous populations around the world requiring molecular genetic analysis.\n\nFraseroscyphus sinuosus (Fraser, 1948). Hydroid. New genus described by Boero and Bouillon 1993, Can J. Zool. 71: 1061-1064. Colonies small (to 20 mm), abundant on coralline algae in the shallow subtidal (6 m) on the exposed outer coast at Horseshoe Cove, Bodega Bay, in front of the Bodega Marine Laboratory.\n\nHydrallmania franciscana (Trask, 1857). Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 187). According to Fraser (1946), H. franciscana and H. distans Nutting, 1899 (reported from British Columbia to San Francisco Bay) are virtually indistinguishable. Colonies 15-20 cm high. Known only from San Francisco Bay and not recorded since its original description (Vervoort 1993).\n\n*Salacia desmoides (Torrey, 1902) (ϭSertularia desmoides). Hydroid (see hydroid plate 47F, 47G). Additional synonyms in Millard (1975, p. 274). Creeping stolon with stems to 4-24 mm high, San Francisco Bay to southern California, 2-150 m (Fraaser 1937). Also reported in South Africa and southern Indian Ocean (Millard 1975).\n\nSertularella fusiformis Hincks, 1861. Hydroid. Synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 190). Colonies small (20 mm), with few or no branches. Oregon and San Francisco Bay to the Galápagos, 11-366 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). *Sertularella spp. Hydroid. Additional species of this genus including S. tenella (Alder, 1856) (see hydroid plate 46K, 46L) occur in our region, as noted by Fraser (1937Fraser ( , 1946Fraser ( , 1948)).\n\nSertularia argentea Linnaeus, 1758. Hydroid. Synonyms in Cornelius (1995b, p. 84). Similar to Sertularia cupressina Linnaeus, 1758. Colonies large (2-30 cm or more), growing in clusters on shore rocks. A cold-water species occurring south to San Francisco Bay, 9-119 m (Torrey 1902;Fraser 1937Fraser , 1946)). As with many other Linnean (and other older Atlantic-based) taxa in our list, these species could represent either valid amphiboreal distributions or undescribed Pacific species with misapplied Atlantic names. *Sertularia spp. Hydroid. Other species of this genus, such as Sertularia similis Clark, 1876 (see hydroid plate 57D, 57E) occur in the region.\n\n*Symplectoscyphus erectus (Fraser, 1938) (ϭSertularella erecta Fraser, 1938, sometimes placed in the genus Amphisbetia). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 239). Although still considered valid, this species (see hydroid plate 47K) is not included in the key because the description by Fraser is inconclusive. Colonies small (10 mm), erect, unbranched; southern California to the tropics, intertidal to 13 m (Fraser 1946).\n\nSymplectoscyphus tricuspidatus (Alder, 1856) (ϭSertularella tricuspidata). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 241), Cornelius (1995b, p. 94), andHirohito (1995, p. 225). An epibiont on other hydroids and on mussels (Cornelius 1995b). Colonies small (to 4 cm), irregular in shape. Alaska to Baja California, 1-500 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998).\n\nSymplectoscyphus turgidus (Trask, 1857) (ϭSertularia turgida, Sertularella turgida). Hydroid. Additional synonyms in Vervoort (1993, p. 241) andHirohito (1995, p. 225). A common species, growing on rocky bottoms and serving as a substrate for various epibionts (Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998). Colonies small (3 cm), stiff, little branched. Alaska to Baja California, intertidal to 200 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Haderlie et al. 1980; * ϭ Not in key. -2777G-CH10[118-188].qxd 5/3/07 03:48 PM Page 162 Techbooks (PPG Quark) Hochberg and Ljubenkov 1998). See color photograph in Haderlie et al. 1980, 3.12, plate 17 as Sertularella turgida. Torrey, 1909. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Occasionally collected in San Diego, Monterey Bay, Friday Harbor, British Columbia (Arai and Brinckmann-Voss 1980;Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 35.\n\nCampanularia volubilis (Linnaeus, 1758). Hydroid. Synonyms in Cornelius (1995, p. 232). Dispersive stage a planula brooded inside the female gonotheca (Cornelius 1995). Colonies stolonal. Reported from the Bering Sea to the tropics (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)), but likely actually limited to Arctic and boreal waters.\n\n*Clytia attenuata (Calkins, 1899). Hydroid and medusa. A little-known species of the shallow subtidal; the hydroid is known from Vancouver Island to southern California and is also reported from the Panama Canal and Brazil (Fraser 1946(Fraser , 1948;;West and Renshaw [see below]). Laboratory life cycle including both hydroid and medusa from material collected at Santa Catalina Island in West and Renshaw 1970, Mar. Biol. 7: 332-339. The synonymy between \"Phialidium\" lomae (see below, as Clytia lomae) and Clytia attenuata remains open to question according to Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980, p. 108). They found that medusae raised by West and Renshaw from the hydroid of C. attenuata were smaller in size, had gonads of a different shape, and fewer tentacles than the medusa C. lomae, and concluded \"until Clytia attenuata can be reared from typical Phialidium lomae medusae the synonymy must be considered tentative.\"\n\nClytia gregaria (A. Agassiz, 1862) (ϭPhialidium gregarium, former name of medusa). Hydroid and medusa. Phialidium Leuckart, 1856, long used as a generic name in medusa literature, has been shown through life cycle studies to be a junior synonym of Clytia Lamouroux, 1812, a name originally applied to hydroids. The medusa, which swims in bursts followed by slow, upside-down sinking (Mills 1981), is often present in large numbers, thus the species name; for feeding behavior and diet, see also Costello and Colin (2002). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 36. Hydroid described from the laboratory, raised from gametes from medusae (Strong 1925, Publ. Puget Sound Biol. Station 3: 383-399;Roosen-Runge 1970, Biol. Bull. 139: 203-221) and not corresponding well to any known species of Clytia from the field (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946;;Arai and Brinckmann-Voss 1980). Alaska to central Oregon (Wrobel and Mills 1998).\n\nClytia hemisphaerica (Linnaeus, 1767) (ϭPhialidium hemisphaericum, ϭClytia johnstoni). Hydroid (medusa unknown on the West Coast of North America). Synonyms in Calder (1991, pp. 57-58) and Cornelius (1995, p. 252). More than one species may exist under this name, which seems not to be applicable to any of the \"Phialidium\" medusae on the West Coast, so not included in the key to hydromedusae. Hydroid colonies at least partly stolonal. On many substrates, and apparently tolerating lower salinities (Cornelius 1995;Fraser 1937 as C. johnstoni (Alder), central California to Alaska).\n\nClytia lomae (Torrey, 1909) (ϭPhialidium lomae). Medusa (hydroid unknown). Medusa described from San Diego and perhaps present along the entire West Coast. Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980) suspect that there are two species of \"Phialidium\" medusae along our coast, and assign the name C. lomae to the slightly smaller species with fewer tentacles, acknowledging that extensive life cycle studies could show only one, variable species to be here (see note under Clytia attenuata, above).\n\nGonothyraea loveni (Allman, 1859) (ϭGonothyraea clarki [Marktanner-Turnerestcher, 1895]). Hydroid. The synonymy of G. loveni and G. clarki is generally accepted but needs confirmation; additional synonymy in Cornelius (1982, p. 92). This is the only species of Gonothyraea on the West Coast. The two other species assigned to that genus by Fraser are now referred to other genera (G. gracilis to Clytia; G. inornata to Laomedea); both occur north of our area. Predominantly estuarine, in colder waters. Colonies small (to 2.5 cm). Widespread in San Francisco Bay shallow waters in 2004, and occurring from there north to Alaska; intertidal to 124 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946, as G. clarki, as G. clarki). An abundant fouling organism.\n\nHartlaubella gelatinosa (Pallas, 1766) (ϭCampanularia gelatinosa). Hydroid. A boreal species found in both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; Queen Charlotte Islands to central California, from lower intertidal to 150 m (Fraser 1937), often in harbors or estuaries. Recorded from 1859 to 1912 in San Francisco Bay including records of Agassiz 1865 and Torrey 1902, with no subsequent records (Cohen and Carlton 1995, Appendix 2, p. 1).\n\nLaomedea calceolifera (Hincks, 1871) (ϭCampanularia calceolifera). Hydroid. Synonymy in Cornelius (1982, p. 102). A fouling species, frequent in harbors and estuaries. Colonies small (to 2.5 cm high), with sexually dimorphic gonothecae. Introduced from the Atlantic; on floating docks at Richmond Marina and Coyote Point Marina, San Francisco Bay, 2004. Obelia bidentata Clark, 1875 (ϭObelia bicuspidata Clark, 1875). Hydroid and medusa. While the names O. bidentata and O. bicuspidata were introduced in the same paper, the former was assigned priority under the First Reviser Principle in nomenclature by Jäderholm [1903].) Additional synonymy in Calder (1991, pp. 70-71). Medusae infrequently observed anywhere in the world. On floating dock at Pier 39, San Francisco, 2004. Hydroid throughout San Francisco Bay, 13-22 m (Fraser 1937, as O. bicuspidata).\n\nObelia dichotoma (Linnaeus, 1758) (ϭObelia commisssuralis McCrady, 1859). Hydroid and medusa. Additional synonyms in Calder (1991, pp. 72-73), Cornelius (1995, p. 296), andHirohito (1995, pp. 74-75). Species highly varied in form, occurring on many different substrates including swimming animals (ranging from sharks to copepods). Alaska to the tropics, frequent in our region (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). Standing (1976, pp. 155-164 in Coelenterate Ecology and Behavior [G. O. Mackie, ed.], Plenum) reports on the role of O. dichotoma in fouling community structure in Bodega Harbor.\n\nObelia geniculata (Linnaeus, 1758). Hydroid and medusa. Synonyms in Cornelius (1995, p. 301) andHirohito (1995, p. 76). Colonies small (25 mm), immediately distinguished by asymmetrically thickened internodes and hydrothecae (Cornelius 1995), although occasional specimens occur with unthickened perisarc. On various substrates, especially algae; frequent in brackish water. British Columbia to the tropics, including our region (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)).\n\nObelia longissima (Pallas, 1766). Hydroid and medusa. A large (up to 60 cm) fouling hydroid, common in harbors. Easy to confuse with O. dichotoma. Alaska to southern California, low tide to 128 m (Fraser 1937(Fraser , 1946)). Our harbor-dwelling Obelia hydroids are probable ship fouling introductions. They are commonly fed upon by several nudibranch species.\n\nOrthopyxis compressa (Clark, 1877) (ϭEucopella compressa). Hydroid and ephemeral medusa. Discussion of synonomies and taxonomic confusion in Arai and Brinckmann-Voss (1980: 101-104). Colonies stolonal, with perisarc of varied thickness, sometimes thin but often very thick; pedicels smooth. Alaska to San Diego, 5-37 m (Fraser 1937). Common on larger hydroids or on red algae. Medusae are shed sequentially at dusk, with females released about 15-20 minutes before males from nearby colonies; the medusae live free for less than one hour, only long enough to shed gametes (see Miller 1978. J. Exp. Zool. 205: 385-392, misidentified as O. caliculata).\n\nOrthopyxis everta (Clark, 1876) (ϭEucopella everta). Hydroid. Retains gametes. Colonies stolonal, with perisarc of varied thickness, pedicels wavy or annulated. British Columbia to San Diego, 2-77 m (Fraser 1937). Sometimes abundant on kelp.\n\nOrthopyxis integra (Macgillivray, 1842). (ϭEucopella caliculata, ϭAgastra mira). Hydroid and ephemeral medusa. Synonyms in Cornelius (1982, p. 61;1995, p. 235). Colonies largely stolonal. Alaska to southern California, low tide to 439 m (Fraser, 1937(Fraser, , 1946)); cosmopolitan species.\n\nAglauropsis aeora Mills, Rees and Hand, 1976. Hydroid and medusa. Medusae collected primarily washed up on open beaches from Bodega Bay to Monterey Bay; minute polyp without tentacles known only from the laboratory. See Mills et al. 1976, Wasmann J. Biol. 34: 23-42. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 36.\n\nCraspedacusta sowerbii Lankester, 1880 (ϭC. sowerbyi, a misspelling). Hydroid and medusa. Introduced; now worldwide in fresh water, including in the upper Sacramento River near Redding, and in quarry lakes and reservoirs in many other areas in California. See Russell (1953) for detailed discussion. The simple, well-known hydroid, without tentacles, looks very much like that raised in the laboratory only through the primary polyp stage of both Aglauropsis aeora and Maeotias marginata.\n\nEperetmus typus Bigelow, 1915. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Distinguished from Aglauropsis aeora by the smaller number of thicker tentacles and presence of centripetal canals. From Alaska to Washington, where it becomes uncommon; rare sightings in Coos and Yaquina Bays. Usually pale pink. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 37. Records from Japan are an undescribed Aglauropsis; see Mills et al. 1976, Wasmann J. Biol. 34: 23-42.\n\nGonionemus vertens A. Agassiz, 1862. Hydroid and medusa. In the shallow subtidal, usually seen clinging to algae or eelgrass, but may also be free-swimming near the surface in protected bays. Indigenous from Alaska to Washington, but known from a variety of locations worldwide and might be expected south of Washington. See plate 49Q for tiny, cryptic solitary polyp; color photograph of medusa in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 37. A virulent-stinging variety or separate species occurs in the Russian Far East. See Edwards 1976, Adv. Mar. Biol. 14: 251-284 for a global review.\n\nMaeotias marginata (Modeer, 1791). (ϭMaeotias inexspectata Ostroumoff, 1896 [misspelled occasionally as inexpectata]; see Mills and Rees 2000). Hydroid and medusa. Most medusae found in the San Francisco Bay system are males, but a few females discovered in 1998 allowed for the culture of embryos. Hydroids of Maeotias are known only from juvenile polyps raised under laboratory conditions (Rees and Gershwin 2000); these are miniscule and morphologically simple, with a cluster of cnidocysts around the mouth and without tentacles. A brackish to freshwater species, introduced to the San Francisco Bay area by the 1980s or 1990s, with an unconfirmed observation in 1959 (see Mills and Rees 2000). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 29. A hydroid identified as this species by Mills and Sommer (1995) from the San Francisco area is Moerisia sp. instead (see Mills and Rees 2000).\n\nVallentinia adherens Hyman, 1947. Medusa (hydroid unknown). Occurs near shore, clinging to algae (see Hyman 1947, Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 66: 262-268); known only from the Pacific Grove area (where it is found on the kelp Macrocystis off Hopkins Marine Station [between the breakwater and Point Piños], Freya Sommer personal communication), and Santa Barbara (Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003); rare. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 37.\n\nAgalma elegans (pro parte M. Sars, 1846)-Sars' original description included more than one species, and authorship is thus noted as pro parte. A cosmopolitan species, which can be found anywhere from Alaska to Mexico. Easily distinguished from A. okeni as it has a long stem with leaflike bracts, while in A. okeni the stem is short so the bracts, with two (young) or four (mature) distal facets, interlock with each other. Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\n*Agalma okeni Eschscholtz, 1825. This second cosmopolitan species of Agalma (siphonophore plate 59C) is also present on our coast, but more likely to be encountered off southern California and Baja California. Further distinguished from A. elegans by the distinctive ridges on the swimming bells, and Y-shape of the subumbrella when viewed from above. Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nNanomia bijuga (delle Chiaje, 1841). Probably the most common physonect off the West Coast, thought to be responsible in some regions for the deep scattering layer (Barham 1963, Science 140: 826-828;Barham 1966, Science 151: 1399-1403), but occurs to the surface; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills, 1998 and2003, p. 46.\n\nApolemia spp. This genus is quite diverse on our coast, with several undescribed species (the name \"Apolemia uvaria\" has been applied rather indiscriminately in past West Coast literature). The colonies are often tens of meters long and in deep water, but many-centimeter-long fragments can be encountered near shore at the surface. They have an overall \"fuzzy\" appearance, with red or white gastrozooids, and pack a substantial sting. The flimsy, jelly-filled bracts also contain patches of stinging cells on their upper surfaces. Species occur in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and Mediterranean. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 45. * ϭ Not in key. -2777G-CH10[118-188].qxd 5/3/07 03:48 PM Page 164 Techbooks (PPG Quark) FORSKALIIDAE Forskalia spp. Several species of Forskalia, which are difficult to distinguish, might be encountered along our coast. Divers sometimes liken the overall aspect of Forskalia to a Christmas tree: conical, widening at the base, with fine tentacles coming out from within the overall shape. They are active, strong swimmers, often spiraling around as they move. When disturbed they may release clouds of pigmented, bioluminescent material. Species occur in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 46.\n\nPhysophora hydrostatica Forsskål, 1775. Colonies are typically several centimeters high and the compact complexity, symmetry, and pastel blue and pink colors of this worldwide species are sure to engender wonder in anyone who sees it; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 46.\n\nAbylopsis tetragona (Otto, 1823). This distinctive species is likely to be encountered only at the southern end of the range of this book; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\n*Bassia bassensis (Quoy and Gaimard, 1833). Another polyhedral species (siphonophore plate 60C) similar to Abylopsis tetragona, which is also likely to be encountered only at the southern end of the range of this book; the ridges of the swimming bells have a bluish tinge; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nChuniphyes multidentata Lens and van Riemsdijk, 1908. An abundant midwater species that is occasionally encountered at the surface in central California; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nChelophyes appendiculata (Eschscholtz, 1829). One of the most common epipelagic temperate and tropical oceanic siphonophore species and likely to be seen anywhere along the Pacific West Coast including Baja California; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean. When present in substantial numbers, this species has enough sting to be quite bothersome to divers and snorkellers.\n\n*Chelophyes contorta (Lens and van Riemsdijk, 1908). Perhaps a near-shore, rather than oceanic species (siphonophore plate 60H) (Totton 1965), with a somewhat more southern distribution that C. appendiculata, so to be expected only in the southern range of this book, continuing down into Mexico; appears to have an Indo-Pacific distribution (Bouillon et al 2004).\n\nDimophyes arctica (Chun, 1897). In spite of its name, this is a cosmopolitan species found in all oceans including the Arctic and Antarctic and can be encountered anywhere along the Pacific coast of North America.\n\nDiphyes bojani (Eschscholtz, 1829). Might be encountered anywhere along the California and Baja California coasts; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nDiphyes dispar Chamisso and Eysenhardt, 1821. More likely to be encountered in the southern range of this book, continuing down Baja California, but has worldwide distribution in warmer waters. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 47.\n\nEudoxoides spiralis (Bigelow, 1911). Epipelagic species found usually south of about 40°N on our coast; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nLensia challengeri Totton, 1954. Can be encountered anywhere along the Californian and Baja Californian coast; found throughout the Pacific, usually south of about 40°N, usually near shore.\n\nLensia conoidea (Keferstein and Ehlers, 1860). Cosmopolitan species and likely to be seen anywhere along the Pacific West Coast including Baja California.\n\nLensia hostile Totton, 1941. A typically deep-water species found off California; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nLensia hotspur Totton, 1941. Can be encountered anywhere from Oregon to Baja California; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\n*Lensia spp. Several other little Lensias are found off the West Coast; only the most common species have been included in the key.\n\nMuggiaea atlantica Cunningham, 1892. A coastal species of the temperate Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean that can be found throughout the study area. In some localities, M. atlantica can be replaced by M. kochi at different times of year, which might be related to water temperature, but the two species appear to be mutually exclusive. M. atlantica has been collected in Bodega Harbor. Photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 47.\n\nSulculeolaria quadrivalvis Blainville, 1834. The looping radial canals and lack of ridges are distinctive of this genus among the Diphyidae; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p.  *Lilyopsis rosea Chun, 1885. An uncommon prayid species (siphonophore plate 59I) with a large subumbrellar cavity, which has been seen in central California; Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nPraya dubia (Quoy and Gaimard, 1827). These siphonophores are often tens of meters long and in deep water, but several cm-long pieces of the colonies may be encountered near shore at the surface. The bright yellow color of the gastrozooids is striking; they have a substantial sting. Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nPraya reticulata (H. B. Bigelow, 1911). Similar to above species, but with reticulate pattern of canals on the subumbrella. The branching pattern of the somatocyst also distinguishes it. Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Rosacea spp. Several species of Rosacea occur off the West Coast of North America and are difficult to identify and often confused with Praya spp. Typically, the bracts are hemispherical while those of Praya spp. are flattened. A near-shore observer is most likely to run into fragments of one of these colonies, which can reach many meters in length when undamaged and will sting.\n\nSphaeronectes gracilis (Claus, 1873(Claus, , 1874)). Sometimes occurs near shore from Monterey Bay south, but can be very difficult to see; Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean.\n\nAegina citrea Eschscholtz, 1829. Medusa only. A variable worldwide, oceanic species (that may turn out with molecular study to be a species complex) that may occasionally be seen near shore; sometimes infused with yellow pigment. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 38. Undescribed aeginids are also present in deep water.\n\nCunina spp. Medusa only. Worldwide, oceanic species that occasionally come near shore. These are typically 10-60 mm in bell diameter and may be transparent and colorless or have some color. See Kramp (1961Kramp ( , 1968) for specific characters. Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 39. Solmissus incisa (Fewkes, 1886). Medusa only. A worldwide, oceanic species, this is the larger (to 100 mm bell diameter) and less common Solmissus; it can be colorless or sometimes infused with transparent purple color (see Kramp 1961Kramp , 1968)).\n\nSolmissus marshalli A. Agassiz and Mayer, 1902. Medusa only. A worldwide, oceanic species, this is the smaller and more common of the two Solmissus that might be encountered near shore. It is usually colorless and Ͻ60 mm in bell diameter (see Kramp 1961Kramp , 1968)). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 39.\n\nPegantha spp. Medusa only. Worldwide, oceanic species that occasionally come near shore. These are typically 25-50 mm in bell diameter and may be transparent and colorless or have some color. See Kramp (1961Kramp ( , 1968) for specific characters. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 38. Solmaris spp. Medusa only. Worldwide, oceanic and coastal species that are sometimes encountered near shore, sometimes in great numbers. These are small transparent medusae with a rapid pulsation rate. See Kramp (1961Kramp ( , 1968) for specific characters. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 39. TETRAPLATIDAE *Tetraplatia volitans Busch, 1851. Highly reduced narcomedusa up to about 1 cm long that looks more like a flying worm or pteropod than a jellyfish, with a ringlike constriction fairly near the midpoint dividing the oral and aboral ends, which are connected by four flying buttress-like structures. Oceanic in the upper 900 m, but occasionally found near shore; feeds on zooplankton (see Hand 1955, Pac. Sci. 9: 332-348; color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 52, and at http://jellieszone.com/tetraplatia.htm). The two species of Tetraplatia have been proposed as both coronate scyphomedusae and as narcomedusae, but a genetic study by Collins et al. (2006) has placed these unusual medusae in the hydrozoan Narcomedusae.\n\nHALAMMOHYDRIDAE *Halammohydra sp. Medusa only. Minute (0.5-2 mm), highly reduced medusa (without a polyp phase, although it looks like a polyp), living interstitially in sand; solitary not colonial form. Found on a beach near Moss Landing (as reported by Robert Higgins and James Nybbaken). The entirely ciliated animal consists mostly of a manubrium with two whorls of long, contractile tentacles; there is a statocyst between each pair of tentacles and an aboral adhesive organ. A number of species have been described.\n\nGeryonia proboscidalis (Forsskål, 1775). Medusa only. Oceanic warm waters in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean; occasionally seen near shore in the southern range of this book; sixpart symmetry distinguishes this less-common species from Liriope tetraphylla. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 40.\n\nLiriope tetraphylla (Chamisso and Eysenhardt, 1821). Medusa only. Oceanic, Pacific, Atlantic, and the Mediterranean; occasionally seen near shore throughout the range of this book, sometimes in great numbers in warm water masses; four-part symmetry distinguishes this species from the less-common Geryonia proboscidalis. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 40.\n\nAglantha digitale (O. F. Müller, 1776). Medusa only. A common species in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic, typical of the upper 200 m and sometimes found nearshore. This species has two modes of swimming: a general slow swim and a strong escape swim separately mediated by giant axons. Usually colorless, but may have red, pink or orange color on the tentacles. For feeding behavior and diet see Costello and Colin (2002). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 42.\n\nAglaura hemistoma Péron and Lesueur, 1809. Medusa only. Oceanic, Pacific, Atlantic, and the Mediterranean; occasionally nearshore, between about 40°N and 40°S, replacing Aglantha as the most abundant epipelagic species in warmer waters. It is smaller and more fragile than Aglantha and has two modes of swimming (slow feeding mode and fast escape swim). Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p.  The relatedness of the 200 worldwide species of scyphozoan jellyfish (Mianzan and Cornelius 1999) known as semaeostome medusae, rhizostome medusae, coronate medusae, stauromedusae, and cubomedusae remains unclear (Dawson 2004b, Marques andCollins 2004). Here we use the names for the three jellyfish groups that we treat in this section without making phylogenetic judgments.\n\nThe jellyfish we cover are those that are likely to be found in the intertidal, shallow subtidal, or in bays and harbors along the coast. The semaeostome scyphomedusae are usually large and often colorful, pelagic medusae that are not encountered in the intertidal zone as adults except when cast ashore, but may often be seen in harbors. Nearshore species of semaeostome scyphomedusae are considered here. The stauromedusae, in contrast, are small, inconspicuous, stalked medusae that are found either in protected bays or in highcurrent or wave-swept areas in the lower intertidal and subtidal, attached by an aboral stalk to eelgrass, seaweed, or rock. One cubomedusa, Carybdea sp., may be found from Santa Barbara south in the shallow subtidal along the open coast. Two species of rhizostome scyphomedusae, Phyllorhiza punctata and Stomolophus meleagris, may also occasionally be found in Southern California.\n\nScyphomedusae (sometimes rather objectionably called the \"true\" jellyfish) can be distinguished from hydromedusae by their usually larger size, frilly mouth lobes, scalloped margins bearing lappets, absence of a velum, presence of marginal rhopalia, and often-complex pattern of radial canals (plates 61 and 62). In contrast, hydromedusae (see plate 39) usually are small, often glassy-clear, and possess a velum; most have four simple radial canals. For an account of the more fundamental morphological differences, the student is referred to Hyman (1940a), Russell (1970), or any detailed invertebrate zoology textbook.\n\nSemaeostome scyphomedusae that live near our coast have an attached polypoid part of their life cycle: the soft, white \"scyphistoma\" stage, which can be encountered in great numbers under shaded parts of floats in harbors or marinas or on boat hulls. Most (probably all) of these scyphistomae (plate 62A, 62B) encountered in harbors on the West Coast of America belong to Aurelia. The polyp phases of other West Coast scyphomedusae have not been located in the field, although most have now been cultured in the laboratory by curators at the Monterey Bay Aquarium (some are described in Gershwin and Collins 2002).\n\nSemaeostome scyphomedusae, when they are plentiful, play a significant role in coastal food webs by consuming a variety of zooplankton prey, ranging from small copepods to ctenophores and other large medusae. A number of other species depend on them for food or protection. Jellyfish are eaten by sunfish (Mola mola) and leatherback turtles. Gotshall et al. (1965) note that in California the blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus \"stalks\" Chrysaora, biting off pieces of the oral arms while avoiding contact with the marginal tentacles, and show a photograph of about a dozen fish feeding on a single C. fuscescens. Other jellyfish found in guts of the blue rockfish included Aurelia and \"Pelagia\" (= C. colorata?). A variety of species \"hitchhikes\" on the larger medusae, especially crustaceans such as amphipods and crab larvae. Many of the medusae discussed in this are large and awkward to study whole under a microscope. Preservation for morphological purposes should be done in 5% to 10% percent buffered formalin; specimens or portions of specimens for molecular studies should be preserved in Ͼ70% ethanol and stored in a refrigerator or freezer (Dawson 2004b).\n\nBeautiful color images of most of the scyphomedusae in this key can be found on the Internet. See especially http:// jel-lieszone.com/scyphomedusae.htm and http://divebums.com/ main.html for particularly nice photographs taken mostly in California. Caution must be exercised in the accuracy of web identifications of some of the species; use keys such as this one for the authoritative name for a species.\n\nFamilies used in the species list are from Cairns et al. (2002).\n\nABORAL the side of the jellyfish opposite to that on which the mouth opens (the upper surface of the bell in pelagic species).\n\nCALYX the flaring bell-like portion of a stauromedusa, containing the gonads, central manubrium and marginal tentacle clusters.\n\nCNIDOCYST (ϭNEMATOCYST) stinging organelle characteristic of the Cnidaria, consisting of a double-walled capsule containing fluid and a long tubule that everts and straightens when the capsule discharges upon stimulation; used for prey capture, defense and attachment (also inaccurately called \"stinging cell\").\n\nCN I DOCYST VE S ICLE S round, white, cnidocyst-filled structures visible through the calyx wall of some species of stauromedusae.\n\nEXUMBRELLA the outer, aboral, surface of a jellyfish \"bell.\" GONADIAL SACS the many round structures that fill the gonads of stauromedusae (also called \"genital sacs,\" \"vesicles,\" or \"follicles\").\n\nLAPPET one of the lobes separated by clefts at the margin of a pelagic scyphomedusa.\n\nMANUBRIUM central stomach structure that attaches to the center of the subumbrella.\n\nMARGINAL ANCHOR marginal structure between tentacle clusters in some species of stauromedusae; lacking any special sensory capabilities, these are morphologically merely reduced tentacles (sometimes called \"rhopalioids\").\n\nORAL the side of the jellyfish to which the mouth opens. ORAL ARM feeding and prey capture structure attached to the manubrium and surrounding the mouth. On a scyphomedusa, there are nearly always several (usually four in semaeostome and eight in rhizostome medusae) oral arms surrounding the mouth; they may be simple or frilly and membranaceous, or very complicated and fleshy; digestion often begins while prey are still within the oral arms.\n\nPLANULA (plural planulae) microscopic, egg-shaped or subcylindrical larva that develops from a cnidarian egg.\n\nRADIAL CANALS circulatory canals on the subumbrellar surface of a jellyfish emanating from the mouth toward the bell margin; these may be simple or may branch one or more times. RHOPALIUM (plural rhopalia) one of the numerous marginal sense organs in clefts between lappets at the margin of a scyphozoan bell. Rhopalia usually have a gravity receptor (statocyst) and one or more \"eyes\" (ocelli). Cubomedusae are very sensitive to light and have multiple eyes, some with large lenses, on each rhopalium.\n\nSCYPH I STOMA the asexual benthic (bottom-living) polyp stage of semaeostome and rhizostome scyphomedusae. These are often capable of reproduction by fission or pedal laceration and also metamorphose so as to produce stacks of tiny jellyfish (ephyrae) that break loose one by one (a process known as strobilation) and mature in the plankton, usually over several months.\n\nSTALK elongate portion at the aboral end of a stauromedusa, with which it attaches to rock, eelgrass, or seaweed.\n\nSTROB I LATION asexual process in which a semaeostome scyphistoma absorbs its tentacles and produces instead a stack of developing jellyfish by transverse fission (the parent polyp and the resulting jellyfish are all the same sex, either male or P LATE 62 Aurelia spp. A, Aurelia labiata. scyphistoma; B, Aurelia labiata. strobilating polyp; C1, C2, Aurelia labiata (oral and side views); D1, D2, Aurelia sp. 1 (oral and side views) (all images by Claudia E.

The only cubomedusa (box jelly) known from the West Coast of North America, can be common during autumn in the surf zone just inside the kelp beds at Santa Barbara. This medusa, bell to 4 cm tall, has also been collected at Redondo Beach, Malibu, and La Jolla, all in Southern California. Previously known in the West Coast literature as the Western Pacific C. rastoni Haacke, 1886, and the Atlantic C. marsupialis (Linnaeus 1778), ours is an undescribed species (L. Gershwin personal communication 2005, based on specimens collected at Redondo Beach).

Vancouver Island and from northern California to Baja, California, this species probably occurs along the entire West Coast; to about 4 cm long.

Known from Vancouver Island, Washington, and central California, attached to Zostera or algae in semiprotected subtidal habitats; to about 4 cm long. Often with Haliclystus; uncommon. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 50. Larson, 1988. British Columbia and Southern California in the subtidal on cobble with, or nearby, crustose coralline algae in areas of wave surge. Extremely cryptic (to about 2 cm long), and thus probably occurs along much of the North American coast.\n\nHaliclystus salpinx Clark, 1863. Known mostly from the North Atlantic, and on the Pacific coast from only from a small number of isolated bays in the San Juan Islands (Washington) and southern Vancouver Island, this boreal species, to about 3 cm, might be expected to be found elsewhere on the West Coast (unless it was introduced locally in early coastal exploration and shipping); its trumpet-shaped marginal anchors are distinctive. Haliclystus sp. (ϭH. nomen nudum). Hirano (1997), having studied Haliclystus from all over the world, concluded that West Coast material from at least British Columbia to California is an undescribed species (it had been previously called H. auricula, H. octoradiatus, H. stejnegeri, and H. sanjuanensis). It is the same as H. \"sanjuanensis,\" which is, however, an unpublished manuscript name (Gellerman 1926) and thus not available despite its occasional appearance in the literature (Guberlet 1936(Guberlet , 1949;;Hyman 1940b). Look closely to distinguish the superficially similar H. salpinx (see above). Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 49. *Haliclystus sp. (ϭH. \"californiensis\" of Gwilliam 1956). This unpublished manuscript name (Gwilliam 1956) applies to a single specimen of about 2 cm, found by Paul Silva at 29 m, off Christy Cove on Santa Cruz Island. The species is distinct in having a very short stalk topped by a calyx that is wide open at the top, but very elongate, nearly tubular, at the base.\n\nUndescribed genus and species (\"Stenoscyphopsis vermiformis\" of Gwilliam 1956). This unpublished manuscript name (Gwilliam 1956) applies to eight specimens, found only once in 1952, on Macrocystis off the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove. Gwilliam stated that this species (to about 1.5 cm long) was extremely cryptic, matching the color of the seaweed; he was unable to find it again.\n\nCyanea capillata (Linnaeus, 1758). The \"lion's mane,\" especially abundant from Washington northward to the Bering Sea (and in the Atlantic) in the summer and fall, this cold-water species is less numerous off Oregon and only occasionally seen in northern California. Usually Ͻ50 cm in diameter. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 54. Martin, Gershwin, Burnett, Cargo, and Bloom, 1997. This species can be enormous, with oral arms extending as much as 6 m beyond the 1 m diameter bell; it has a dark purple, nearly black, umbrella and was seen along the coast of Southern California and Baja, California, in 1989, 1999, and 2005. Where it occurs most years (when it is not found off California) is not known.\n\nChrysaora colorata (Russell, 1964). Formerly known as Pelagia colorata (see Gershwin and Collins 2002) and often misidentified as P. noctiluca (see below a separate species of worldwide distribution, found usually south of California in the eastern Pacific). The apparently oceanic C. colorata reaches about 70 cm in diameter and regularly washes ashore on the beaches of Southern California and is occasionally found as far north as San Francisco Bay and Bodega Bay; most sightings are in the late spring. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 54.\n\nChrysaora fuscescens Brandt, 1835. This is the common central California and Oregon species of Chrysaora, which may occur in shoals just offshore and stranded on beaches. It can be found from the Gulf of Alaska to Mexico and usually has up to about 30 cm bell diameter. There is much confusion in the literature about the name of this animal, which has frequently been referred to as C. melanaster, a separate species (see below). Other names used in the literature for this species include C. helvola Brandt, 1838 and C. gilberti Kishinouye, 1899, both junior synonyms of C. fuscescens (see Larson 1990;color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 53).\n\nChrysaora melanaster Brandt, 1835. Although this name is frequently seen in the older California literature, it properly belongs to a more strongly patterned species (to 60 cm diameter) found commonly in Alaska and perhaps British Columbia and occasionally drifting to the south at least as far as Oregon, perhaps with rare sightings in California (see Larson 1990; color photograph of underside in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 53).\n\n*Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskål, 1775). An oceanic warm water species of all seas most likely to be encountered south of the range of this book, distinguished by its 16 marginal lappets, with eight tentacles alternating with eight rhopalia around the margin, and conspicuous exumbrellar \"warts.\" P. noctiluca is a small scyphomedusa, generally not exceeding 9 cm in diameter; color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 54. ULMARIDAE *Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1758; occasionally as Aurellia). This species, which may reach 50 cm in diameter, is apparently endemic to the North Atlantic and Baltic (see Gershwin 2001and Dawson 2003, 2004a). It is characterized by eight, rather than 16, marginal lobes and unbranched, rather than anastomosing, adradial canals. Despite the common use of this name in West Coast literature, A. aurita is not known from the American Pacific coast.\n\nAurelia labiata Chamisso and Eysenhardt, 1821. Originally described from the San Francisco area, this once largely forgotten name is the correct one for a Northeast Pacific endemic species (to about 40 cm diameter) that includes most of the Aurelia on the West Coast, from central California to Oregon, with a northern variant extending to Alaska which appears to be an evolutionarily distinct lineage (Gershwin 2001;Dawson and Jacobs 2001;Dawson 2003Dawson , 2004a)). Some specimens in Alaska with brown marginal pigment correspond to another apparently valid species, Aurelia limbata Brandt, 1835. Aurelia typically occurs in large aggregations, rather than singly, although the mechanisms for keeping such aggregations together are unknown. Color photograph in Wrobel and Mills 1998and 2003, p. 55. Aurelia sp. 1 (of Dawson 2003, 2004a, b). Aurelia medusae in Southern California are morphologically different but of similar size to those further north (Gershwin 2001) and have been shown using molecular techniques (Dawson and Jacobs 2001;Dawson 2003Dawson , 2004a, b) , b) to be a separate species of worldwide distribution, including Los Angeles to San Diego, Tokyo Bay, and northern Japan, Australia, Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of France, and probably also in south San Francisco Bay. This species may have been widely distributed by ships. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 55 (top).\n\nPhacellophora camtschatica Brandt, 1835. Occurs in the Pacific from Kamchatka to Alaska to Chile, but is more common at higher latitudes; also known from the North and South Atlantic and Mediterranean. Occasionally seen in bays in California and Oregon; to about 60 cm bell diameter. Color photograph in Wrobel andMills 1998 and2003, p. 55.\n\nDAPHNE G. FAUTIN AND CADET HAND (Plates 64-68)\n\nAnthozoa, the largest class of cnidarians, including the familiar sea anemones and corals, contains more than 6,000 species. The most diverse anthozoan fauna is in the coral-reef areas of tropical and subtropical seas, where representatives occur of some orders not found from central California to Oregon. Some tropical anthozoans are also much more massive than those on the shores of California and Oregon, but on some shores of the northeast Pacific, anthozoans dominate space, so animals of this class play a prominent role in the ecology of both tropical and temperate seas.\n\nUnlike cnidarians of the other classes, anthozoans do not possess a medusa phase. Thus the anthozoan polyp reproduces sexually and, in most species, asexually as well. Gametes are derived from the endoderm and develop in the mesenteries. In most species, gametes are spawned through the mouth into the sea, where fertilization takes place and a planktonic planula larva develops. Ultimately, it metamorphoses and settles onto or into the substratum. Several species of local anemones, by contrast, brood their young. In Epiactis ritteri, for example, * ϭ Not in key.\n\nC N D A R I freely spawned sperm seem to find their way into the coelenof a female, where the eggs are fertilized and develop. The small anemones that are released settle down directly, without having passed through a dispersal stage. Likewise, in E. prolifera, development is direct, but the young develop attached to the outside of the parent's column and simply crawl off when mature. It appears that these sexually produced young are being budded, but Epiactis, like most anemones, does not reproduce asexually, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nAmong the local sea anemones that undergo asexual reproduction are Diadumene lineata and Metridium senile. In the process known as \"pedal laceration,\" little bits rip from the edge of the pedal disc of an individual of M. senile as it remains in one spot or as it glides along the substratum, a daughter anemone developing from each bit of tissue. Thus dense clones of the animals develop, with the original individual encircled or trailed by its genetically identical progeny. Clones are also characteristic of Anthopleura elegantissima, which propagates asexually by longitudinal binary fission (as does D. lineata), and of Nematostella vectensis, which propagates asexually by transverse binary fission.\n\nMost local anthozoans belong to the subclass Hexacorallia (or Zoantharia). Hexacorallians are characterized by simple or branched hollow tentacles that are typically numerous, often a multiple of six in number. Sea anemones, members of the hexacorallian order Actiniaria, are the most diverse intertidal anthozoans in Central California. All sea anemones are solitary (although they may be clonal), whereas at least some members of most other orders are colonial (that is, clonemates are physically attached to one another). Another difference between sea anemones and hexacorallians of most other orders is that anemones lack skeletons.\n\nPlate 64 illustrates the anatomy of a typical sea anemone. Its form is that of an animal attached by its base; Flosmaris grandis (plate 66) illustrates a typical burrowing anemone. At the basal end of the body column is the pedal disc, the site of at-tachment of the polyp to the substratum, or, in most burrowing anemones, the bulbous physa. In species in which the column is divisible into regions that differ morphologically, the scapus is just distal to (above) the physa or the pedal disc; the scapus is typically the longest region of the column. Distal to it is the scapulus and/or the capitulum. The column may have a collar (parapet) in its distal part and bear protuberances of various sorts; verrucae (Latin for warts) are present on many anemones of California and Oregon (plate 65). Hollow tentacles used in food capture and ingestion are arrayed in circlets and/or radial rows on the oral disc.\n\nIn anemones of some taxa, below the edge of the oral disc, at the top of the column, is a circle of small tentaclelike structures termed \"marginal spherules\"; when inflated, these are used in aggression (see, for example, Francis 1973b). The top of the column can be drawn over the tentacles through contraction of the circularly arrayed sphincter muscle. The slitlike form of the mouth, which is in the center of the oral disc, reflects the biradial symmetry of an anthozoan polyp. The long axis of the mouth is termed the \"directive axis.\" The mouth leads into the actinopharynx (gullet), a tube of tissue that opens into the body space, the coelenteron.\n\nThe coelenteron is divided by numerous radially arrayed longitudinal sheets of tissue (mesenteries) that extend from the column wall and some of which attach at their opposite edge to the actinopharynx. (Mesenteries have also been called septa, a term that should be reserved for the calcareous partitions of scleractinian corals that are flanked and secreted by the mesenteries.) The edges of the mesenteries are thickened into mesenterial filaments, which bear gland cells that serve in digestion, and cilia that keep the fluids within the coelenteron moving. Gametes develop in some or all of the mesenteries. Extending from the lower edge of some mesenteries of certain taxa are threadlike structures, acontia. Acontia can be emitted though the mouth or through pores in the column wall (cinclides), presumably as a defense. P 65 Large sea anemones. Individuals of some species may exceed mm in diameter, most individuals of these species (except for A. elegantissima) reach 100 mm. All are members of family Actiniidae. Appearance of the species Anthopleura elegantissima and A. sola can be so similar they were long considered to belong to a single species. However, A. elegantissima is clonal whereas the larger A. sola is solitary. The two also differ in habitat. Anthopleura xanthogrammica, which can grow to a diameter of 500 mm, is typically somewhat smaller-about the same size as A. sola, with which it can be confused. These drawings are semidiagrammatic to emphasize the differences between them (Original drawings by Vicki B. Pearse, redrawn by Mildred Waltrip). Members of the genus Urticina are typically red in color. One of the largest anemones on this coast, Urticina piscivora has a column that is solid velvety-red and tentacles that are all either pink or white (Drawing by Steven Sechovec). The white verrucae and pigment spots of U. lofotensis may run together when the animal contracts, giving it a red-and-white-striped appearance (Drawing by Steven Sechovec). Some individuals of Urticina crassicornis are mottled with green, and the rare one may lack red altogether (drawing by Steven Sechovec). Individuals of the sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissima, A. sola, and A. xanthogrammica typically posses zooxanthellae. These dinoflagellates live within cells of the endoderm, the inner cell layer of anemones. Several plant cells may live within one animal cell (Shick 1991). In Anthopleura, they are densest at the distal end and diminish in density proximally (that is, toward the base). Nearly all species of reef-forming corals are also zooxanthellate, as are giant clams, some foraminiferans, many species of tropical sea anemones, and some other tropical cnidarians. Outside the tropics and subtropics, some New Zealand anemones are also zooxanthellate (Buddemeier and Fautin 1996).\n\nZooxanthellae were once considered to belong to a single species, Symbiodinium microadriaticum, which was described from a tropical jellyfish. It is now known that there are many taxa of zooxanthellae and that there is not a simple 1:1 relationship between taxa of hosts and algal symbionts (e.g., Kinzie 1999). According to LaJeunesse and Trench (2000), some individuals of A. elegantissima in central and southern California possess simultaneously zooxanthellae of two species, S. muscatinei and S. californium.\n\nA large proportion of the carbon fixed by the zooxanthellae through photosynthesis may be translocated to the animal, a process that was first demonstrated in A. elegantissima (see Muscatine and Hand 1958). Thus, although the host cnidarian cannot digest its symbiotic algae, it does benefit nutritionally from them. The symbiosis is mutualistic, the algae taking up products of the host's metabolism (Shick 1991). In a manner that is not understood, possession of zooxanthellae allows precipitation of massive calcium carbonate skeletons by reef-forming corals and giant clams (Gattuso et al. 1999). Calcification is also enhanced in zooxanthellate foraminiferans.\n\nIndividuals of A. elegantissima, A. sola, and A. xanthogrammica living in the dark, e.g., in caves (as in Oregon and Washington), under piers (as on the old Cannery Row of Monterey), or even under overhangs or deep in tide channels, lack symbiotic algae (Secord and Muller-Parker 2005). Such animals may be white rather than the typical green color; animals that live in dim light have low densities of zooxanthellae and most are intermediate in color. The green color, however, is not that of the algae, but is produced by the animals (Pearse 1974). The pigment functions to block potentially harmful radiation (Shick 1991).\n\nSymbiotic algae affect not only the biochemistry but also the behavior of their host anemones. Individuals of A. elegantissima with zooxanthellae move toward light whereas those lacking them do not (Pearse 1974). Some tropical anemones possess outgrowths of their bodies in which zooxanthellae are concentrated and that extend during daylight and retract at night (Gladfelter 1975).\n\nIn addition to or instead of zooxanthellae, some individuals of A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica north of San Francisco possess unicellular symbiotic green algae, called zoochlorellae (Muscatine 1971, Lewis andMuller-Parker 2004). Anemones that contain mainly or only zoochlorellae tend to occur in places with lower light levels than those with mainly or only zooxanthellae (Secord and Augustine 2000). Zoochlorellae may live in the same cells as the zooxanthellae (Muller-Parker, personal communication). An individual zoochlorella cell photosynthesizes at a lower rate than an individual zooxanthella cell, and much more carbon is translocated to the anemones from zooxanthellae than from zoochlorellae (Verde andMcCloskey 1996, Engebretson andMuller-Parker 1999).\n\nStress can disrupt the animal-alga symbiosis. Atypically high or low temperature, salinity, or sunlight, high UV insolation, or noxious chemicals can result in the break-down of the symbiosis. This phenomenon is termed \"bleaching\" because in corals it results in the normally brownish animal appearing white. The transparent tissue of the coral animal allows sunlight to reach the zooxanthellae, the color of which is usually perceived; when algae are absent, the white calcium carbonate skeleton is visible through the animal tissue. Bleaching is often explained as the host expelling the algae, but it is unclear whether that is happening or whether the dinoflagellates initiate the break-down in the symbiosis. Initiation probably varies with the stress and the species involved. Animals may reacquire zooxanthellae, so bleaching is not invariably lethal. In fact, a low level of algal loss appears to be normal (e.g., Fitt et al. 1997Fitt et al. , 2000)). Such \"background bleaching\" may be a mechanism of changing symbiotic partners (Buddemeier and Fautin 1994). Anthopleura elegantissima, A. sola, and A. xanthogrammica appear to be far less susceptible to bleaching than is typical of tropical animals. Moreover, individuals living in dark places appear not to suffer from their lack of symbiotic algae.\n\nMembers of most species of Zoanthidea, also called Zoanthiniaria, propagate asexually, and the progeny remain tightly or connected to one The tentacles of each polyp arise only at the margin. Grains of sand and other hard objects of similar size may be incorporated into the body wall. Zoanthids are mostly tropical; the lone local species, Epizoanthus scotinus, is subtidal in California and Oregon but may be intertidal in Washington.\n\nAnimals of order Corallimorpharia are commonly termed sea anemones but are actually more like scleractinian corals, except they lack a skeleton. Among the distinguishing features that can be seen in the lone local intertidal representative of this taxon, Corynactis californica, are the very large nematocysts (to more than 100 µm in length).\n\nThe stony corals, order Scleractinia, are represented in the local intertidal fauna by the solitary orange cup-coral, Balanophyllia elegans.\n\nThe tube anemones constitute order Ceriantharia. Almost exclusively subtidal, these animals have a ring of short tentacles immediately around the mouth and a ring of long tentacles at the margin of the oral disc. There are few cerianthid species in the world, and the only one locally is rarely found intertidally.\n\nMembers of the subclass Octocorallia (or Alcyonaria) are predominantly colonial, and each polyp has eight hollow tentacles that are pinnately branched.\n\n1.

Some species of cnidarians transmit the algae in their eggs (Fadlallah 1983), but others, such as A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica, do not (Siebert 1974), which obliges larval or juvenile animals to acquire their symbiotic algae from the environment (Schwarz et al. 2002), just as bleached animals presumably do. It is thought that algae may be concentrated in the feces of predators of anemones, such as nudibranchs (Muller Parker 1984), which thereby serve as vectors.\n\nP LATE 6 6 Some smaller sea Epiactis prolifera rarely exceeds a basal diameter of 30 mm. Its externally brooded young are of various sizes (drawing by Steven Sechovec). Epiactis lisbethae grows to a maximum basal diameter of 80 mm. The tentacles of this specimen are contracted, but typically the tentacles droop down over the column. The young are all of similar size. The oral disc of Aulactinia incubans resembles that of E. prolifera and E. lisbethae, but the lines on its directive axis run into the mouth. The young of A. incubans are brooded internally. Individuals of this species are similar in size to those of Epiactis (drawing by Steven Sechovec). Flosmaris grandis is a large burrowing species. This drawing illustrates the divisions of the body typical of only some anemones (drawing from Hand and Bushnell 1967). Corynactis californica is not a true sea anemone-it is actually a coral without a skeleton. Individual polyps are about 10 mm in diameter (drawing by Steven Sechovec). 2.

Anthopleura sola P LATE 6 8 More small sea Looking very similar, an individual of Diadumene sp., D. leucolena, and D. lighti can resemble anemone in this drawing.\n\nIn California and Oregon, a specimen of Metridium senile is typically no longer than 50 mm. The name was also previously used also for specimens of M. farcimen, which can grow to more than 10 times that length. Halcampa decemtentaculata has, as its name indicates, 10 tentacles; it has been erroneously identified as the 12-tentacled H. duodecimcirrata, which occurs in Europe. Zaolutus actius burrows in soft sediments, its pedal disc attached to buried objects. Unlike most anemones lacking a true pedal disc, Cactosoma arenaria does not burrow; rather, it adheres to a firm substratum as in an anemone with a true pedal disc (drawings by Tracy R. White).\n\nHalcampa decemtentaculata Aulactinia incubans Dunn, Chia, and Levine, 1980.

Most West Coast species are strictly subtidal, and several shallow water species of gorgonians (sea fans) occur from Monterey Bay to Baja, California. However, at least seven species of inconspicuous soft corals are occasionally encountered under rocky overhangs in the low intertidal from Southern California to Oregon. The sea pens are subtidal for the most part, but they may be encountered in protected bays at extreme low tide or washed ashore following storms. See the websites \"Octocoral Research Center\" or \"Octocoral Home Page\" for details about the group. The \"Research Techniques\" portion of this website describes a method to isolate sclerites (also known as spicules, the free calcitic skeletal elements of octocorals) from the surrounding tissue for examination.\n\nCryptophyton goddardi Williams, 1999. This stoloniferous taxon inhabits the underside of rocks and overhangs in low intertidal areas; known from the Oregon coast, but to be expected further south into California; possibly referred to as \"Clavularia\" sp. in some publications. More than one species of stoloniferous octocoral may inhabit the West Coast intertidal (see Clavularia spp., below). The genus is characterized by having polyps without sclerites and irregularly shaped sclerites in other parts of the colony. Preyed upon by the nudibranch Tritonia festiva. Clavularia spp. Williams (2000), McFadden and Hochberg (2003) and J. Goddard (pers. comm.) report that members of this genus may inhabit intertidal and nearshore habitats along the California coast. This genus differs from Cryptophyton by the presence cylindrical polyps armed with crown and points and sclerites that are primarily spindles.\n\nTelesto sp. An unidentified species has been found intertidally in exposed open coast situations of Santa Barbara County (J. Goddard, pers. comm.). The polyps form relatively dense clusters. Each polyp is usually 8-10 mm tall, and the polyp walls are thinly coated with a pale orange sponge. A few of the polyps have daughter polyps.\n\nAlcyonium sp. Sea strawberry. An undescribed lobate soft coral; Alaska to Sonoma County, California. The name \"Gersemia rubiformis\" (Ehrenberg 1834) has been applied by many authors to this taxon, but this application is erroneous because the genus Gersemia belongs to the related soft coral family Nephtheidae, and the species G. rubiformis (which also may belong to the genus Alcyonium) is native to the northern Atlantic. More than one species of Alcyonium may inhabit the Pacific coast intertidal area. This soft coral is preyed upon by the nudibranch Tritonia festiva (J. Goddard, pers. comm.).\n\n*Alcyonium pacificum Yamada, 1950. McFadden andHochberg (2003) report this northern Pacific species to the north and west of the California coast from the Alaskan Aleutian Islands to Japan; rocky substrata of kelp beds, 5-20 m.\n\nDiscophyton rudyi (Verseveldt and Ofwegen, 1992). An inconspicuous, disc-shaped soft coral found in the lower intertidal area, usually 8-15 mm in diameter; Vancouver Island to Point Lobos, Central California. The nudibranch Tritonia festiva is a reported predator.\n\nThrombophyton coronatum McFadden and Hochberg, 2003. Southern California (Palos Verdes to San Diego) and Catalina Island.\n\nThrombophyton trachydermum McFadden and Hochberg, 2003. Vancouver Island to Ano Nuevo Point, California. ORDER PENNATULACEA See Williams (1995) for a key and synopses of the sea pen genera. All sea pens in our area are fed upon by the nudibranch Tritonia diomedea (Behrens 2004. Proc. Calif. Acad. Sci. 55[2]: 43). Verrill, 1864(ϭRenilla koellikeri Pfeffer, 1886). Sea pansy; common on low intertidal or shallow subtidal sandflats; Santa Barbara County to Baja California. The nudibranch Armina californica feeds on this species as well as some other sea pens.\n\nAcanthoptilum gracile (Gabb, 1864). Occasionally encountered subtidally in bays; common in Tomales Bay; known from Central California (Sonoma to Monterey Counties). The genus is in need of revision, and other species are likely present, particularly in Southern California.\n\nStylatula elongata (Gabb, 1862). Often common in low intertidal areas of sandy mud; more than one species may inhabit the West Coast. The related genus Virgularia and this genus are easily confused: Stylatula differs from Virgularia by having each polyp leaf subtended by a fanlike armature of spindle-shaped or needlelike sclerites (Williams 1995).\n\nVirgularia spp. Several species whose identification has not been verified occur from Monterey Bay and south, forming subtidal beds in the northern part of their range on gentle slopes or flats of sand or silt, but may be encountered on mud flats at low tide in the south.\n\nPtilosarcus gurneyi (Gray, 1860). Shallow subtidal; sometimes washed ashore. See Batie 1972, Northwest Sci. 46: 290-300 (taxonomy);Birkeland 1974, Eco. Mono. 44: 211-232 (predator/prey interactions). Preyed upon by the nudibranchs Tritonia festiva, T. diomedea, and Toquina tetraquetra. The more southern species of Ptilosarcus, P. undulatus, is found from Baja California to Peru."
