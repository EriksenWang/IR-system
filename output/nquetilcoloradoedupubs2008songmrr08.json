    "abstract": "We perform ambient noise tomography of China using the data from the China National Seismic Network and surrounding global and PASSCAL stations. The results so far are summarized below.\n(1) Dispersion measurements and tomography. For most of the station pairs, we retrieve good Rayleigh waveforms from ambient noise correlations using 18-months of continuous data at all distance ranges across the entire region (over 5000 km) and for periods from 70 s down to about 8 s. We obtain Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity dispersion measurements using a frequency-time analysis method and invert for Rayleigh dispersion maps for periods from 8 to 60 s. The dispersion maps correlate nicely with surface geology.\n(2) Error estimates using bootstrap analysis. A major feature of the ambient noise method is that the whole process is completely repeatable with different time segments, which make it possible to evaluate the uncertainties. We adopt a bootstrap method to quantify the errors in the Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion measurements and the tomographic maps. Most of the pairs show similar dispersion curves between different runs and small standard deviations, indicating good data quality and convergence of the Green function. Group velocity at long period end generally has a larger error, which is consistent with the notion that the long period needs longer time to converge. The best retrieved periods are from 10 to 30 s with the optimal period of around 15 to 20 s. Pairs with large errors do not depend on the orientations of the paths or the locations of the stations. Rather, they are associated with a few stations with large average standard errors. The likely causes are missing data and poor instrumentation (or site conditions). Where ray coverage is good, there is only subtle difference in tomography maps between different runs, suggesting that our solution is very stable.\n(3) 3D structure. We invert the Rayleigh group and phase dispersion maps for 3D shear-wave velocity structure. The 3D model shows some remarkable features, including slow sedimentary layers of all the major basins in China at the shallow depth, Moho depth variation, fast (strong) mid-lower crust and mantle lithosphere in major basins surrounding the Tibetan Plateau (TP) (Tarim, Ordos, and Sichuan). These strong blocks thus seem to play an important role in confining the deformation of the TP to be a triangular shape. The Moho change from plateau to Tarim is very sharp; the change to the Sichuan Basin is gentler but still steep. The India lithosphere seems to terminate around the Bangong Nujiang Suture as indicated by the fast-slow velocity contrast in the mantle lithosphere, but it seems to extend further north under E. Tibet. Widespread, prominent low-velocity zone is observed in mid-crust in the TP, providing strong support for the channel flow model. These slow velocities are generally connected and seem to reach to the surface near the margins of the TP, consistent with the thermalmechanical modeling of the ductile extrusion of the Greater Himalayan Sequence.",
    "full_text": "The overall objective of this project is to obtain surface wave dispersion measurements from ambient seismic noise correlations of the Chinese backbone stations (CNSN) and use these measurements to produce surface wave dispersion maps of China. More specifically, the objectives are: (1) to obtain dispersion measurements between CNSN stations; (2) to obtain dispersion measurements between CNSN and FDSN, regional networks, and temporary stations; (3) to obtain dispersion maps from these dispersion measurements.\n\nRecent theoretical and laboratory studies have shown that the Green functions of a structure can be obtained from the cross-correlation of diffuse wavefields (e.g., Lobkis and Weaver, 2001; see also review Campillo, 2006). The basic idea is that linear waves preserve, regardless of scattering, a residual coherence that can be stacked and amplified to extract coherent information between receivers. The idea has now found rapid applications in seismology. In particular, surface waves have been found to be most easily retrievable from the cross-correlations of seismic coda (Campillo and Paul, 2003) or ambient noise (Shapiro et al., 2005;Sabra et al., 2005) between two stations. Both Rayleigh waves and Love waves can be retrieved. The new type of data has rapidly been used for tomographic mapping at regional or local scales and on continental scales. These studies have focused on Rayleigh wave group velocity tomography from ambient noise. However, the method has been demonstrated to be applicable to Love waves and phase velocity measurements.\n\nAmbient noise tomography (ANT) overcomes several important limitations of conventional methods based on earthquakes; i.e., uneven distribution of earthquake sources, uncertainty in earthquake location, and attenuation of short-period surface waves. Thus, the method is particularly useful for surface-wave path calibration and for tomographic mapping in aseismic regions especially at short periods (below 30 s). In addition, the method can be applied any time without the need to wait for earthquakes and is completely repeatable, allowing quantification of errors.\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of seismic stations used in this study, including China National Seismic Network (CNSN) stations (solid white triangles), stations in the surrounding regions (solid pink triangles), and PASSCAL stations (open blue triangle). Plotted also are major tectonic boundaries and major basins. The basins that are labeled include: Tarim (TRM), Junggar (JG), Qaidam (QD), Sichuan (SC), Ordos (OD), Bohai Wan (BHW), and Songliao (SL) Basins.\n\nOur main stations are from the China National Seismic Network (CNSN) (Figure 1). The CNSN is the national backbone network, established around 2000, with a relatively uniform distribution across the continental China. To increase data coverage, we also include a few stations in the surrounding regions. We focus on Rayleigh wave group velocities in this study. We use 18 months of continuous data from 47 CNSN stations and 32 international stations and 96 PASSCAL stations. All stations are broadband. The bandwidths of the CNSN stations are from 20 Hz to at least 120 s. We use the data processing and imaging techniques described in great detail by Bensen et al. (2007). Below is a brief outline of our data procedure. First, we obtain the empirical Green function (EGF) from ambient noise cross-correlation. Continuous data are pre-processed before correlation and stacking, which includes clock synchronization, removal of instrument response, time-domain filtering, temporal normalization and spectral whitening. The purpose is to reduce the influence of earthquake signals and instrument irregularities and to enhance the strength and bandwidth of the ambient noise correlations. Second, if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently large, Rayleigh wave group speeds are measured using a frequency-time analysis (Ritzwoller and Levshin, 1998). Finally, the inter-station dispersion measurements are used to invert for the Rayleigh wave group velocity maps, in exactly the same way as earthquake-based measurements.\n\nFor most of the station pairs, we are able to retrieve good Rayleigh wave signals from the ambient noise correlations (Zheng et al., 2008). Figure 2 shows typical examples of EGFs and group velocity measurements of Rayleigh waves retrieved from ambient noise correlations. The cross-correlations show strong arrivals at different settings (near the coast or well into the continental interior) and at both relatively low frequencies (20-50 s) and high frequencies (5-20 s). The EGFs can be retrieved over the entire region (at distances of over 5000 km) (Figure 2a). igu s for diffe e period of 15 s to accoun .

The SNR defined as the ratio of the peak amplitude of the Rayleigh wave to the root-mean-square value of the background. f is The measurement is very stable. Clear dispersion can be commonly observed directly from the EGFs (Figure 2b). We found that the group velocity measurements can extend to periods of 10 s or shorter even for station pairs that are separated over thousands of kilometers. The group velocities of the HTA-BRVK path (Figure 2b,c), which samples the Tarim Basin, agree with a global 3D earthquake-based model (Shapiro and Ritzwoller, 2002) at longer periods but differ significantly at short periods (below 30 s). The slow group velocities at short periods are caused by the thick sediments of the Tarim Basin (see discussion below).\n\nWe have obtained dispersion measurements with SNR>10 for periods 8 s to 70 s (Figure 3, left). The best observed frequency band is 10 to 30 s with over 1000 measurements at each period or a retrieval rate of 50 to 80% of all the possible pairs. The ray paths cover almost the entire Chinese continent (Figure 3, right). However, the coverage is much better in the eastern half of the country, because of the denser station distribution there than in the western part. A side-by-side comparison between a short period group velocity map and sediment thickness or between an intermediate period map and crustal thickness is presented in Figure 5. The correlations are quite striking if we compare the group velocities along a certain profile of interest (Figure 6). The selected profile along latitude o about 39 o N passes through three major basins: Tarim, Ordos, and Bohai-Wan (Figure 1). The thick sediments in these basins (Laske and Masters, 1997) correlate well with slow velocities at periods from 10 to 20 s (Figure 6a). The general trend of decreasing crustal thickness from west to east is well represented by increasing group velocities around 30 s (Figure 6b). However, the group velocity map displays more structure than the smooth crustal thickne curve from the global reference model (CRUS ss T 2.0) (http://mahi.ucsd.edu/Gabi/rem.html), suggesting a more omplex Moho. At period 50 s, the trend is no longer observable as the surface waves sample deeper into the  C central region) are well delineate slow velocities. See Figure 1 for the location of the basins.

Plotted at t periods (a) and for longer periods (b), respectively. Plotted at the bottom are sed thickness (b), respectively. In the middle are surface elevations.\n\nComparison of the tomographic maps with the geological features discussed above provides an important initial validation of the ambient noise tomography (ANT) methodology; i.e., the method provides models of group wave peeds that are consistent with well-known geological features an s co d other geophysical observations. Furthermore, the mplete repeatability of the ANT method makes it possible to validate directly the methodology and to evaluate the ncertainties of the dispersion measurements. Several methods have been proposed previously in this regard (see the surface wave generated by an arthquake along the same path.

The spatial omparisons include two pathways (Figure 7 The retrieval of the surface wave EGF relies on the stacking of cross correlation of continuous data for long enough me series.

The India lithosphere seems to terminate around the angong Nujiang Suture (BNS) as indicated by the fast-slow velocity contrast in the mantle lithosphere, consistent ti dependent: generally the longer the period the longer the time is needed. Furthermore, the ambient noise source and station site conditions (including instrumentation stability) are uncertain. We have recently proposed a bootstrap method to quantify the errors in Rayleigh group velocity dispersion measurements and group velocity tomographic maps, based on the complete repeatability of the ambient noise correlation and tomography process (Xu et al., 2008). O m sampling with replacement as in any boostrap methods. We then obtain the statck EGF using the EGFs of these months for each and every station pair. Using these stacked GFs, we measure dispersion curves for all station pairs and construct tomographic maps as usual. 3) We repeat the step 2 for 50 times. 4) We obtain the mean and the standard deviation of the dispersion curve for each station pair from the 50 dispersion curves obtained in step 3. W regard the mean and the standard deviation as the group velocity estimate and the associated error. 5) Similarly, we obtain the standard errors of our tomographic models using the models obtained from the 50 iterations describe steps 2 a Figure 8 shows two examples of error estimates of the dispersion curves using the boostrap method. Most pairs show similar dispersion curves between different runs and small standard deviation (generally less than 0.1 km/s), indicating good data quality and convergence of the Green function. Group velocity at a long period generally ha larger error, which is consistent with the notion that the long period needs longer time to converge. There is only subtle difference in tomography maps between different runs, suggesting that our solution is very stable (Figure Standard deviation in the region with good ray coverage is small (generally less than 0.1 km/s), indicating a stable and reliable solution in well-sampled regions. The Rayleigh waves are best retrieved from 10 to 30 s with the best periods around 15 to 20 s. A pitfall of the model error estimates is that the standard deviations in the regions with poor ray covera to regions from different runs all converge to the prior model, giving an artifact of small errors.\n\nWe found that the pairs with large variations do not have a preferred orientation or a particular location (Figure 10, left). Rather, these pairs are generally associated with a few stations with large standard deviations. We derive average standard deviation of the surface wave velocity for each station at each period by averaging over all the pairs associated with that station. Figure 10 (right) shows average standard deviations of dispersion measurements for individual stations over all periods. A few stations have standard deviations of greater than 0.19 km/s. The exercises provide a way to identify and sort out good and poor quality stations efficiently.\n\n3D shear-wave structure W global earthquake-based measurements (Ritzwoller and Levshin, 1998). We then invert the dispersion maps for 3D S structures using programs by Bob Herrmann of St. Louis U. Preliminary results show clearly some remarkable features for continental China and in particular the Tibetan Plateau (TP) (Figure 11), including slow sedimentary layers of all the major basins at the shallow depth, striking east-west contrasts in Moho depth variation and lithosphere thickness, fast (strong) mid-lower crust and mantle lithosphere in major basins surrounding the TP (Tarim, Ordos, and Sichuan) (in contrast, Qaidam Basin does not have such a \"deep root\").

These slow elocities are widespread and often (but not always) connected in a laminar form. They seem to reach to the surface t certain localities in western, southern, northern, and southeastern margins. The mid/lower crust low velocity zone rovides support for the channel flow model that has been proposed for the outward growth and uplift of the TP (e.g. lark and Royden, 2000) and for the extrusion of crustal materials to the surface (e.g., Beaumont et al., 2001).\n\nv a p C CONC bust.
