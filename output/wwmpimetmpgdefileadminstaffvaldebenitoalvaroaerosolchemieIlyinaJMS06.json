    "abstract": "An ocean model (FANTOM) has been developed to investigate the fate of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the North Sea. The main focus of the model is on quantifying the distribution of POPs and their aquatic pathways within the North Sea. Key processes are three-dimensional transport of POPs with ocean currents, diffusive air-sea exchange, wet and dry atmospheric depositions, phase partitioning, degradation, and net sedimentation in bottom sediments. This is the first time that a spatially resolved, measurementsbased ocean transport model has been used to study POP-like substances, at least on the regional scale. The model was applied for the southern North Sea and tested by studying γ-HCH behaviour in sea water in the years 1995 to 2001. The model's structure and processes are described in details. Concentrations of γ-HCH and its fluxes between upper sediment, sea and atmosphere were modelled, based on discharge and emission estimates available through various monitoring programmes. Model results are evaluated against measurements. Modelled concentrations of γ-HCH in sea water are in good agreement with the observations; the spatial distribution and the downward trend in the entire North Sea are reproduced during the simulation period. The correlation between the model results and measurements is better during warmer seasons suggesting the importance of the temperature dependency of the air-sea exchange.",
    "full_text": "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are synthetic organic chemical compounds which are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. They can be transported over long distances in the atmosphere and oceans. Included in the POPs are organochlorine compounds, e.g. hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) which is the most abundant organochlorine pesticide in both the atmosphere and oceans. POPs are distributed throughout the oceans as a consequence of atmospheric deposition and direct introduction into aquatic systems. Already in the 1970s, it was being predicted that the oceans may be recipients of most of the persistent pesticides used globally (Goldberg, 1975). This was confirmed by observations (Bidleman et al., 1995) and global budget calculations (Strand and Hov, 1996) showing that the oceans are a major storage medium of HCH. Oceans are traditionally thought to be a global reservoir and ultimate sink of many POPs (Iwata et al., 1993;Dachs et al., 2002) and may be a slow but significant medium for their long-range transport (Wania and Mackay, 1999;UNEP, 2003). Upon long-term ongoing uptake of HCH the ocean may achieve equilibrium with respect to HCH partitioning between air and sea, which has been observed for α-HCH (Bidleman et al., 1995;Lakaschus et al., 2002).\n\nThe North Sea is surrounded by highly industrialised countries and receives large amounts of POPs from atmospheric deposition and river discharge. Monitoring campaigns show that nearly all known POP-like chemicals have been detected in the North Sea (OSPAR, 2000;Weigel et al., 2002) as a consequence of their persistence and continued input from contaminated sites and distant sources. Although concentrations of some POPs in the North Sea have been diminishing since the early 1990s, even the reduced levels can still be harmful to the environment (OSPAR, 2000). Concentrations of some POPs in sea water are often five orders of magnitude higher than those in the air (Wania and Mackay, 1999). This will contribute to the capacity of sea water to act as a source by releasing POPs to the atmosphere via the volatilisation process (Hornbuckle et al., 1993;Bidleman et al., 1995;Ridal et al., 1996;Sahsuvar et al., 2003). Furthermore, in shelf areas the sinking particles carry POPs down to the bottom sediments; they may then enter the water column again via re-suspension and return back to the sea surface. Therefore, as primary pollutant sources are reduced, remobilisation from previous repositories, such as water bodies, can act as secondary sources to the atmosphere.\n\nA model to investigate the environmental fate of POPs is a unique tool for testing hypotheses about the processes affecting POPs cycling, especially those whose characteristics are not accessible by experimental approaches, e.g. for calculating single episodes of pollutant release and transport. With regard to availability of comprehensive data on POPs, the North Sea is comparatively well served. The datasets have been accumulated throughout national and international monitoring programmes (OSPAR, 2000) and research projects (Sündermann, 1994), though the data coverage is better for Lindane (γ-HCH) than for other compounds. The environmental fate of αand γ-HCH in the Baltic Sea has been studied using box models within the POPCYCLING-Baltic project during 1996-1999 (Pacyna, 1999). Besides that, there have been campaignbased studies, limited in both time and space, which addressed the occurrence and distribution of POPs in open ocean and shelf seas (Iwata et al., 1993;Schulz-Bull et al., 1998;Lakaschus et al., 2002;Jaward et al., 2004).\n\nThe fate of POPs in sea water depends on a number of mechanical (transport with moving flows), chemical (chemical decay, amalgamation with other chemicals, transfer to gaseous state, etc.), physical (transfer to another aggregative state, adsorption) and biological (pollutant accumulations and transport by biota) processes. These processes can only be fully taken into account with a threedimensional, hydrodynamic ocean model. Therefore, the objective of this study was to design and evaluate such a model and use it to investigate the cycling of γ-HCH in the North Sea. It is a first study of this kind.\n\nSection 2 describes the architecture of the fate and transport ocean model (FANTOM). Results from the 6.5 years simulations of the fate of γ-HCH in the North Sea, model evaluation and its sensitivity towards individual processes are presented in Section 3. Section 4 gives the conclusions and an outlook for future developments.\n\nFANTOM is a three-dimensional Eulerian model designed for describing the long-term fate of POP-like contaminants in the coastal and shelf aquatic environment. FANTOM is aimed at tracing substances released from point or diffuse sources. The tracers can enter the model domain via rivers, adjacent seas or atmospheric deposition. The key processes are described in Fig. 1. They fall into four broad categories. sediment layers by biological activity (bioturbation). It can also be re-mobilised back to the water column when disturbed by erosion processes. (d) Degradation in sea water. Both tracer fractions are subject to degradation in sea water (Section 2.4).\n\nEvolution of the total (dissolved and particle-bound) concentration of the pollutant C at a fixed location results from the sum of sources, sinks, and mechanical transport of a flow field. The latter has a key role in shaping the pollutant's field in sea water. It has two components: transport governed by the averaged current velocity field (advection) and transport due to the presence of the random chaotic component in the velocity field (diffusion). Turbulence in the ocean is determined by the current velocity gradients, surface and deep perturbations, and sea water stratification. It plays an important role in the intensity of the diffusion processes and thus the pollutant's spatial distribution (Baumert et al., 2005). Eulerian transport of tracers due to advection and turbulence is calculated in FANTOM in a similar way to that used by Pohlmann (1987) where only passive transport of conservative and dissolved tracers in the North Sea is considered. Additionally, tracers in FANTOM may undergo other processes in sea water (Fig. 1) acting as sources (Q C ) or sinks (R C ) in the model, leading to the following formulation:\n\nHorizontal flow field components in eastern and northern directions (u and ν) at every model grid point are input parameters required for calculating the horizontal advection of the tracer concentration. These parameters are provided by the ocean circulation model (Section 2.5.2), with the vertical component of the flow field w being calculated from u, ν using the continuity equation. In addition the horizontal and vertical turbulent diffusion is calculated using the horizontal diffusion coefficients (K x and K y ) and the vertical diffusion coefficient (K v ) which are also provided by the ocean circulation model (Section 2.5.2).\n\nAir-sea exchange is believed to be the major pathway for atmospheric input to oceans and seas for many orga-nochlorine contaminants (Iwata et al., 1993;Bidleman et al., 1995;Wania and Mackay, 1999;Lakaschus et al., 2002). Atmospheric deposition can occur as dry gaseous or dry particle deposition, or as wet deposition of gases and particles incorporated in rain droplets or snow. Hence, the net flux of a pollutant to the sea surface from the atmosphere F surf (ng m -2 s -1 ) is represented in FANTOM by the net gaseous air-sea flux F a-w (Appendix A), the dry particle deposition flux F dry (Appendix B) and the wet deposition flux F wet (Appendix C):\n\nPrevious studies have shown that gaseous air-sea exchange dominates over wet and dry particle depositions of organochlorine compounds. Exceptions occur in regions and seasons with intensive precipitation and areas with a high concentration of atmospheric aerosol particles. The relative importance of the different mechanisms of the air-sea exchange is still in debate.\n\nContaminants may be present in sea water either freely dissolved or bound to the suspended particulate matter (SPM). Redistribution between the dissolved and particulate phases essentially affects the dynamics of the tracer concentration distribution in the marine environment. The dissolved tracer fraction follows the path of the water masses, while the particles bound fraction quickly sedimentises and remains in areas where sedimentation is promoted.\n\nParticulate organic carbon (POC), an organic carbon fraction of SPM, is calculated in FANTOM (Appendix D) and is used as a sorbing matrix for POPs. Such an approach is commonly used in modelling POPs accumulation in biota (Skoglund and Swackhamer, 1999) and their export to the deep sea (Scheringer et al., 2004).\n\nThe substance fraction bound to POC, f POC is calculated (Skoglund and Swackhamer, 1999;Scheringer et al., 2004) as:\n\nThe organic carbon-water equilibrium partition coefficient K oc (l kg -1 ) is compound specific (Appendix E) and C POC (kg l -1 ) is the concentration of POC in the solution (Appendix D).\n\nEq. (3) implies that the transfer of POPs from the particulate phase to the dissolved phase and thus also their transport behaviour are controlled by the abundance of POC. This implies that increasing POC content will transfer the chemical from the dissolved to the particulate state. Higher POC concentrations result in lower concentrations of POPs (in ng kg -1 ) in the particulate phase. Most of the POC present in sea water is in the form of particles (Appendix D), which sink to the sea bed by gravitational settling with a sinking velocity ν set (m s -1 ). Correspondingly, the flux of chemicals bound to POC that is removed from the upper sea layers together with sinking particles F set (μg m -2 s -1 ) is calculated as:\n\nMany organic compounds are lipophilic (fat soluble) and hydrophobic. Lipophilic compounds are characterised by high values of octanol-water partitioning coefficient, K ow (N10 5 ) (Appendix E). These are mostly bound to POC and tend to disperse and accumulate in the sediment rather than in the water column.\n\nCombined abiotic (due to photolysis and hydrolysis) and biotic degradation in sea water is represented in the model by a first order rate decay coefficient, k deg (s -1 ), with the higher order kinetics being neglected. It is assumed that degradation is linearly dependent on the compound total concentration dC / dt = -k deg •C. No measurements of degradation in sea water exist. There is no experimental evidence suggesting that anthropogenic organic compounds bound to marine SPM are more resistant to degradation processes than those dissolved in sea water. Consequently the k deg value for γ-HCH (Table 1) has been chosen on the basis of a thorough compilation of physical-chemical properties of selected POPs (Klöpffer and Schmidt, 2001;Lammel et al., 2001).\n\nIt is a recommended value for fresh water divided by a factor of 10 to account for reduced biotic degradation in sea water relative to fresh water. Following the expert estimates (EU TGD, 1996) the k deg value is assumed to double per 10 K temperature increase. Degradation in the sediment is neglected.\n\nThe model covers the southern and central North Sea up to 57.1°N (Fig. 2), a shallow region with mean depth of 50 m and a maximum depth of 160 m. The horizontal resolution of the model is 1.5′ by 2.5′ (corresponding to 2.5-3 km) and there are 21 vertical layers of varying depth, i.e. 5 m in the upper 50 m, and 10 m in lower layers. The number of vertical layers is different from one grid point to another depending on the local depth.\n\nIn the North Sea the distribution and mixing of water masses is largely subject to tidal currents, meteorological conditions, and run-off from rivers and the Baltic Sea. Westerly winds prevail over the North Sea. The predominant circulation driven by winds and tides is anticlockwise along the North Sea coast causing short flushing times (time needed for the water mass to be exchanged). That means that the existing climate happens to be favourable for the North Sea ecosystem. However, this circulation pattern can regionally be reversed when transient prevailing easterly winds cause an extension of water mass flushing times (Sündermann et al., 2002).\n\nThe flushing time of water, calculated by the inflows and outflows, is estimated to be about 1 year in the entire North Sea (OSPAR, 2000). However the flushing time varies in different subregions of the North Sea: it ranges from 28 days in the northern part to 40 days in the central North Sea (Lenhart and Pohlmann, 1997).

This aspect is of key importance, because lying between land and sea coastal habitats are subject to a range of influences and are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressure.\n\nThe transport processes in FANTOM which are driven by ocean currents are calculated from the distributions of the flow field (Section 2.1) available from ocean circulation models. In this study the HAMburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM) was coupled with FANTOM (Fig. 3) for the entire simulation period. HAMSOM is a baroclinic, primitive equation circulation model based on a semi-implicit numerical scheme described elsewhere (Backhaus, 1985;Pohlmann, 1996). HAMSOM covers the same domain and uses the same spatial resolution of 1.5′ by 2.5′ as FANTOM (Fig. 2). Simulations were carried out with a time step of 10 min. Atmospheric forcing for HAMSOM is calculated using the ECMWF ERA-40 data at a 6 h time step and 1.125°spatial resolution (ECMWF, 2005). Boundary conditions for the open ocean are obtained from HAMSOM applied to the entire North Sea and a part of the north-eastern Atlantic (Pohlmann, 1996).\n\nThe results of the circulation model (e.g. flow fields and their variances, vertical diffusion coefficients, sea temperature and salinity distribution and sea surface heightsee Fig. 3) are stored as daily means averaged over two periods of the predominant semidiurnal lunar tide M 2 (Bartels, 1957). Such a coupling approach has been used previously (Pohlmann, 1987;Luff and Pohlmann, 1995).\n\nLindane is one of the most widely used pesticides globally and it has been used for a long time. It was chosen for this study as it is a semi-volatile organic compound which is mostly observed in the dissolved phase in water. It possesses a relatively high water-air partitioning coefficient and a low octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Table 1).\n\nLindane consists of about 98% of γ-HCH, an isomer of the technical HCH which contains five stable isomers, namely α (60-70%), β (10-12%), γ (6-10%), δ (3-4%) and ε (3-4%) (Willet et al., 1998). The last two of these compounds are not routinely found in environmental samples. Technical HCH was banned in the 1980 because of its toxic effects in the environment. γ-HCH is still used in many countries as an insecticide in agriculture, as a wood and building preservative, and as a biocide to combat lice and scabies. Its use in the countries adjacent to the North Sea is restricted (SRU, 2004). But despite restrictions and bans, α-βand γ-HCHs are still widely found in the North Sea. A large proportion enters the water through flooding, run-off from treated areas, and incorrect disposal of left-over mixtures into farm drains and sewage systems. Atmospheric depositions can also contain γ-HCH transported from remote regions (Semeena and Lammel, 2005).\n\nInventories and knowledge about HCH isomers in general and γ-HCH in particular are relatively complete. γ-HCH is subject to regular monitoring in the sea through national (Bund-Länder monitoring programme in Germany) and international monitoring programmes (OSPAR, HELCOM).\n\nPhysical-chemical properties of a chemical, environmental parameters and release data are required input data for the model (Fig. 3). Initial and boundary conditions include initial distribution of the selected chemical and its values on the boundaries throughout the simulation period. For the studied domain (Fig. 2), the following boundaries are considered in the model: air-sea interface and boundaries with the neighbouring water bodies (i.e. Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, English Channel) and the inflowing rivers that drain into the North Sea.\n\nDaily mean distributions of flow components, their variances, sea surface height, diffusion coefficients, salinity and sea temperature were obtained from the corresponded HAMSOM simulations (Section 2.5.2).\n\nThe initial distribution of γ-HCH concentrations (Fig. 4) and its values on the sea boundaries were interpolated using measured non-filtered samples (Theobald et al., 1996) and therefore represent the total concentration. Initial conditions for the concentration are defined by the function C 0 as C(x,y,z,0) = C 0 (x,y,z). Boundary conditions for the water boundaries B are prescribed:\n\nwhere C B is the concentration at the water boundary. The boundary condition at the coast is ∂C / ∂n| (x,y,z)∈Γ = 0. At the bottom, with the bottom depth D, the tracer flux to the bottom is calculated according to Eq. ( 4) When the re-suspension occurs (Appendix D) the tracer flux at the sea bottom is directed upwards.\n\nBecause the North Sea is a tidally influenced shelf sea, the inflowing rivers have estuarine characteristics, i.e. the tide and river flow interact. The phenomenon of mixing water masses is taken into account by using measurements at the last tide-free gauge station of each river (Lenhart and Pätsch, 2004). The river loads of the selected Fig. 5. a) γ-HCH concentrations in the atmosphere at the EMEP stations and b) γ-HCH loads (Q riv × C riv ) in the continental rivers. Geographical locations of the measurement sites are shown on the map (Fig. 2).\n\nchemical in FANTOM from the European continental rivers including the Elbe, the Weser, the Ems, the Rhine and Meuse, and the Scheldt are calculated as a product of the daily fresh water discharge Q riv (m 3 s -1 ) (Lenhart and Pätsch, 2004) and the concentrations of the compound C riv (ng l -1 ) (Fig. 5b). Data for C riv from the German rivers were provided by the various Environmental Agencies (ARGE-ELBE, 2005;NLOE, 2005). The pollutant concentrations in the Dutch rivers are available from the Dutch online database Waterbase (DONAR, 2005). The loads of POPs reported to OSPAR (2000) were used for the Thames and the Humber (Fig. 2). Values of C riv are available with different temporal resolutions (e.g. monthly means) and were interpolated using spline interpolation to fit the temporal resolution of the model.\n\nBoundary conditions at the air-sea interface are based on measured monthly averaged total (gaseous and particle sorbed) concentration of γ-HCH in the air and its total concentration in precipitation C pr (Fig. 5a) available from the EMEP online database (EMEP, 2005). The measured values from several EMEP stations (Fig. 2) were interpolated to the whole domain. The wind speed and direction, air temperature and precipitation rate P are calculated using the ECMWF 6 hourly ERA-40 data (ECMWF, 2005). The tracer's flux on the sea surface is determined according to Eq. ( 2):\n\nCompound specific physical-chemical properties (e.g. K ow and k deg ) are listed in Table 1. The Henry's law constants were calculated as a function of temperature using values recently given by Sahsuvar et al. (2003) for all model simulations with the exception of the experiment where values reported by Kucklick et al. (1991) were used.\n\nThe model simulations were carried out for the period from July 1995 to December 2001 with a time step of 10 min. Model results were stored as daily averaged values.\n\nModel evaluation consisted of two stages.\n\nDaily averaged concentrations in the uppermost sea layer were compared with the individual measurements and plotted for six of these points (Fig. 6) located in different subregions of the North Sea and with sufficient number of measurements. A clear seasonal pattern with  T. Ilyina et al. / Journal of Marine Systems 63 (2006) 1-19\n\nhigher concentrations in summer is predicted for most years in all locations. Similar patterns are also found in the atmospheric concentrations (Fig. 5a) and in the continental river loads of γ-HCH (Fig. 5b). The highest concentrations, up to 3.95 ng l -1 (Table 2), were found at locations near the coast, e.g. A (Fig. 6a), G and K (Fig. 6b and c); the lowest ones, of less than 0.2 ng l -1 (Table 2)  and summer of 1997 and decreased concentrations during 1998-2001 (Fig. 5a). At most of the locations, namely at A, E, G to P, measurements were made during warm seasons (May-September) corresponding to the predicted maxima. At locations B, C, D and F measurements were conducted between December and March.\n\nIn order to evaluate the model results, measured γ-HCH concentrations are plotted against calculated ones in scatter plots (Fig. 7) for the same locations as in Fig. 6. Correlation coefficients for all locations where time series were available are presented in Table 2. Good correlation was found for locations A, H and P with correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.93 and 0.94 respectively. Lower correlation coefficients between 0.23 and 0.40 were found for the locations F, D and B where the time series consist of the measurements conducted between December and March. The number of measurements and their temporal resolution, in particular at the locations P, O and M, make further statistical analysis inappropriate.\n\nTime series of γ-HCH concentration in the southern North Sea surface water reported elsewhere (SRU, 2004) show a gradual decrease since the 1980s due to the restriction in technical HCH application in the countries adjacent the North Sea. This decrease is captured by the model during the studied period. Furthermore, model results suggest that γ-HCH concentrations declined in the entire modelling domain.\n\nAlthough γ-HCH is a rather well studied contaminant and subject to national and international monitoring programmes, data availability remains an important constraint for constructing an observation based, spatially resolved model. Unlike regular monitoring in the atmosphere, where monthly or even weekly measurements of γ-HCH are available for the European region (e.g. EMEP, 2005), observations of sea water concentrations are discrete in time and space due to operational constraints. Many model input parameters are of limited availability and have to be estimated by extrapolation and interpolation methods. Those values that are available for a given parameter often exhibit large variability and uncertainties. Also there are uncertainties introduced by the poor temporal and spatial resolution in measured data, both in the sea water and in the atmosphere.\n\nExperiments aimed at explaining the deviations in modelled and observed γ-HCH concentrations were performed (Fig. 8). In the first experiment it was assumed that the concentration of γ-HCH in water flowing into the North Sea from the English Channel and from the northern boundary of the modelling domain is zero, Fig. 8. Observed (dots) and FANTOM γ-HCH concentrations (ng l -1 ) in the surface layer at the location A, under different model setup: solid linemain model simulation; dashed linewhen γ-HCH concentrations inflowing via the lateral boundaries were equal zero; dash-dot linewhen airsea exchange was calculated using Henry's law constants given by Kucklick et al. (1991). Geographical locations are given in Table 2 and are shown in Fig. 2.\n\ni.e. C B = 0 (Eq. ( 5)). The resulting time series of the concentration was plotted for location A in the German Bight where the impact of inflow from these boundaries was expected to be less pronounced than elsewhere. In the second experiment the Henry's law constant temperature dependency was calculated using the values obtained by Kucklick et al. (1991) instead of those by Sahsuvar et al. (2003) used in other model runs (Table 1). Daily averaged concentrations in the uppermost sea layer resulting from the main simulation and both expe-riments were compared with the individual measurements at the location A (Fig. 8).\n\nNo regular measurements of γ-HCH concentrations in the English Channel and on the northern sea boundary were available for this study. Since concentrations in the whole North Sea decreased they have probably also decreased in the English Channel and on the northern sea boundary without being captured by the model. This offers an explanation for the overestimation in calculated concentrations during the years 2000-2001. The overestimation is most pronounced at location N, lying in the passage of the English Channel water (Fig. 6e).\n\nCorrelation coefficients calculated for locations B, C, D and F (Table 2) are lower, even though they are situated only within a few model grid points from locations A, E, G and H, where correlations are much better. Calculated concentrations at locations B, C, D and F are higher than observed (Table 2). One explanation for this discrepancy could be that during winter the stronger winds which occur over the North Sea induce higher current speeds enhancing stronger water mass flushing. Consequently there is an increase in the amount of less polluted waters from the open lateral boundaries being transported into the German Bight. As mentioned above the decrease in γ-HCH concentrations in the English Channel and on the northern boundary might not be correctly captured by the model leading to overestimated winter concentrations. This hypothesis is verified by the modelling experiment when γ-HCH concentrations in the English Channel and on the northern boundary of the modelling domain were set to zero for the entire simulation period. Fig. 8 indicates that concentration without inflow from the lateral boundaries was a significant component of the γ-HCH burden until the second half of the year 2000. Furthermore, ongoing cycling of earlier emitted γ-HCH leakages from inappropriate disposal may play a role.\n\nAtmospheric concentrations of γ-HCH used for this study were measured at coastal stations. Therefore there is no information on possible concentration gradients over the whole North Sea and in the subregions remote from the polluted coastal areas. Concentrations of γ-HCH in precipitation measured in Lista, Westerland and Kollumerwaard exhibit significant differences (Fig. 5a). For some pollutants, e.g. for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), air concentrations over the coastal waters are expected to be higher than those over the open ocean waters because of their vicinity to sources. However, there are indications that air measured in Lista originate from the North Sea about 2/3 of the time (Haugen et al., 1998). Since the measured air concentrations were available only from Lista they were used for the whole modelling domain.\n\nThe seasonal pattern predicted by the model with higher γ-HCH concentrations during summer than during winter emphasises the importance of temperature dependency of the air-sea exchange. For the Great Lakes of North America and for the Arctic Ocean it has been found that during summer, the air-sea gas transfer is net volatilisational, whereas during colder period it is depositional (Ridal et al., 1996;Jantunen and Bidleman, 1996). Measurements suggest (Sahsuvar et al., 2003) that temperature dependency of H c has a profound effect on gas exchange predictions. This hypothesis is illustrated by Fig. 8 where γ-HCH concentrations resulting from model calculations using two different temperature dependency coefficients of H c are shown. Recent experimental data (Sahsuvar et al., 2003) used in this study lead to higher (10-50%) sea water concentrations. Therefore as parameterisation of the air-sea exchange seems to play a key role, its uncertainty should be reduced. Discrepancies in the experimentally determined values of H c and possibly physical processes not included in the model (see Appendix A) contribute to this uncertainty.\n\nMeasurements in the North Sea's uppermost layer of 5 m thickness compiled during summer 1995 and interpolated on the modelling domain of FANTOM (Fig. 4) show clear gradients of γ-HCH with the highest concentrations in the southern regions of the North Sea, in the estuaries of rivers and in the English Channel. The highest concentration of 8 ng l -1 was found close to the mouth of the River Elbe.\n\nAnnual mean γ-HCH concentrations averaged vertically for the whole modelling domain in the years 1996-2001 were calculated (Fig. 9). These results show positive gradients of concentration towards the coasts; a similar pattern was found in the initial distribution (Fig. 4). During 1995-1997 total concentration of γ-HCH in the continental coastal water was above 1 ng l -1 with a concentration of more than 25 ng l -1 in the River Elbe estuary. As with the γ-HCH concentration at the selected locations (Fig. 6), concentrations in the whole modelling domain decreased. This effect is more pronounced in the southern regions of the North Sea where initial concentrations had been highest.\n\nObserved spatial distribution of γ-HCH total concentration with decreasing concentrations towards the north-western part of the North Sea, similar to those showed by this modelling study (Fig. 9), have been reported in the scientific literature (Gaul, 1988;Theobald et al., 1996;Hühnerfuss et al., 1997, Lakaschus et al., 2002) and by the OSPAR Commission (OSPAR, 2000). Low concentrations in the north-western North Sea (Fig. 9) are due to the inflow of cleaner Atlantic water. Along the coastline from southern Britain to Denmark close to the estuaries there are high concentrations; this indicates the importance of the river inflow which modulates the local circulation. In fact, measurements in coastal waters close to large estuaries suggest that river input is a significant source for γ-HCH in the North Sea (Sündermann, 1994;Hühnerfuss et al., 1997).\n\nAnother indication for that is the jagged pattern in the concentration's time series in the German Bight (Figs. 6a, b and 8) which is due to variability of the fresh water inflow (Fig. 5b). As opposed to the German Bight, in the open North Sea (Fig. 6d, f) remote from the polluted estuaries, time series are smoother and sea water concentrations seem to be balanced by the volatilisationdeposition process. This offers an explanation for the slower decrease in γ-HCH concentrations in the central North Sea than in the southern German Bight. This also implies that in coastal areas, waterborne inputs of γ-HCH may be dominant, whereas atmospheric deposition is more important in the open sea and can exhibit the same order of the magnitude as river inputs (Hühnerfuss et al., 1997). A correlation between γ-HCH concentrations in water (Fig. 6) and its concentration in precipitation and in the air (Fig. 5a) is found.\n\nThe mean anti-clockwise currents pattern commonly observed in the North Sea (Section 2.5.1) favours short flushing times (stronger transport) of water mass along the south eastern coast of about 11 days and longer ones of about 40 days in the central North Sea (Lenhart and Pohlmann, 1997;OSPAR, 2000). Weaker transports (or longer flushing times) in some subregions of the North Sea suggest that the concentrations of semi-volatile compounds, such as γ-HCH, should be more sensitive to vertical exchange rates and less dependent on the horizontal circulation. This also implies that a relatively water soluble compound, e.g. γ-HCH, which ends up in these areas of the North Sea may not be subject to transport with sea currents to any significant extent. On the other hand, γ-HCH in the subregions with stronger transports, e.g. in the German Bight where the concentrations are also higher, will be transported northwards within the coastal current. Typical speeds of sea currents are 0.01 m s -1 which are 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than in the atmosphere. This, together with the variations in the water mass flushing times (see Section 2.5.1), implies that only those substances with a residence time in sea water of up to a year or longer may undergo transport with sea currents over long distances in the North Sea.\n\nVertical distribution of sea temperature and salinity in January and August 1997 and corresponded γ-HCH distribution from south to north along the 3°E are plotted in Fig. 10. In winter the southern North Sea is in general well mixed to the bottom (Fig. 10a). This is also reflected in the distribution of γ-HCH total concentrations (Fig. 10b). During warm seasons a stable thermal stratification is formed by summer heating (Fig. 10c) enhancing vertical gradients in γ-HCH total concentrations in the northern part of the domain (Fig. 10d). High values of about 0.6 ng l -1 are found near the sea surface, and low values of less than 0.2 ng l -1 below, where the Atlantic water inflows. The high γ-HCH concentrations of more than 1.2 ng l -1 were found in the continental river estuaries both in January and August. As already illustrated by the time series (Fig. 6), γ-HCH concentrations in August were higher than in January. Concentrations beneath the thermocline, if present, do not show seasonal variations.There were no measurements available on the vertical distribution of γ-HCH concentrations in the North Sea. Model results suggest that the vertical structure of total γ-HCH concentration (Fig. 10b, d) seems to be shaped by water column stratification and its seasonal variability (Fig. 10a, c).\n\nThe fate and transport ocean model FANTOM was developed to describe the oceanic fate of POPs in the North Sea. The processes considered are transport with sea currents, air-sea exchange, partitioning of particulate organic carbon, net sedimentation and degradation in the sea.\n\nThe model was applied to study the aquatic fate of the insecticide Lindane (γ-HCH) in the years 1995-2001. This is the first time that such model has been applied on the regional scale. Predicted γ-HCH concentrations in the surface water were compared with measured ones. The model is able to reproduce the spatial distribution of γ-HCH concentrations and capture its decrease during the simulation period. While there is excellent agreement for warm seasons, FANTOM overestimates winter concentrations of γ-HCH.\n\nModel uncertainties and sensitivities were explored. From these it is concluded that particular data needs exist with regard to off-shore atmospheric environment and the description of the air-sea exchange. Concentrations in the atmosphere correlate with concentrations in sea water, indicating the significance of the atmospheric input of γ-HCH in the North Sea. Overestimations in the modelled concentrations in 2000-2001 seem to be due to the lacking data for the open sea boundaries. There were no measurements on the vertical concentration structure. Therefore model performance with regard to sedimentwater exchange cannot be assessed.\n\nAlthough FANTOM is capable of reproducing the spatial and temporal distribution of a fairly water soluble contaminant such as γ-HCH, it remains a future task to investigate the fate of compounds with different phy-sical-chemical properties and hence environmental behaviour. FANTOM can be used to study the contribution of different sources and sinks to the mass budget. Also the sensitivity of POPs behaviour in the aquatic environment to the ambient processes under present and future climate conditions can be studied.\n\nparameters (e.g. temperature and wind speed), physicalchemical properties of the compound and its abundance in the environment.\n\nThe two mass transfer coefficients, u 1 and u 2 (m s -1 ) for the stagnant (unstirred) atmospheric boundary layer and for the stagnant water layer close to the air-water interface respectively are calculated as a function of wind speed WS (m s -1 ) at 10 m above the surface using relationships (according to Schwarzenbach et al., 1993) u 1 = 6.5•10 -4 •(6.1 + 0.63•WS) 0 . 5 •WS and u 2 = 1.75•10 -6 •(6.1 + 0.63•WS) 0.5 •WS.\n\nFugacity capacities of air and water Z a and Z w (mol m -3 Pa -1 ) at air temperature T a (K) and sea surface temperature T w (K) are calculated as Z a = 1 / R•T a and Z w = 1 / H c (T w ) respectively. The ideal gas constant R (R = 8.314, Pa m 3 mol -1 K -1 ) and the Henry's law constant H c (Pa m 3 mol -1 ) at T w are used to describe the equilibrium partitioning of trace gases between air and water. Experimentally derived relationships for H c are calculated from the temperature dependent equation (Kucklick et al., 1991;Paasivirta et al., 1999;Sahsuvar et al., 2003) using slope m (K) and intercept b:\n\nThe overall exchange rate constant D wa for volatilisation from sea water (mol Pa -1 s -1 ) is calculated according to Mackay (2001) and Wania et al. (2000) D wa = A w / (1/ u 1 •Z a + 1/ u 2 •Z w ), where A w (m 2 ) is the surface area of the water compartment. The gaseous exchange rate constant for the dry gaseous deposition is calculated similar to volatilisational one. Transfers from the atmosphere to the sea surface by dry particle and wet depositions are calculated separately (Appendix B and Appendix C).\n\nThe net mass transfer rate (mol s -1 ) is calculated for the tracer gaseous concentrations in the air C a and dissolved in sea water C w expressed in mol m -3 :\n\nThe air-sea flux F a-w (ng m -2 s -1 ) to the surface is then re-calculated from Eq. (A2) using the tracer's molar mass M (g mol -1 ). The direction of the flux F a-w is determined by its sign (i.e. positive values of F a-w indicate gaseous deposition, and negative values indicate volatilisation from the sea surface).\n\nOrganic contaminants sorbed to atmospheric aerosol particles can settle to the sea surface by dry particle de-position. The dry deposition flux from the atmosphere to the sea surface F dry (ng m -2 s -1 ) is expressed as a product of the contaminant particle-bound concentration in air C ap (ng m -3 ) and a dry deposition velocity ν dep (m s -1 ):\n\nDry deposition velocities depend on particle size, underlying surface properties, and meteorological parameters (e.g. wind speed). For this study a uniform value of ν dep =2•10 -5 m s -1 was used. This was based on an empirical relationship between ν dep and the mass median diameter (an average value used to describe aerosols particles) for oceanic conditions (McMahon and Denison, 1979;Slinn, 1983) and the assumption that the γ-HCH distribution follows the air particles size distribution which peaks in the accumulation mode.\n\nAtmospheric concentrations reported by the monitoring programmes often represent the total (gaseous and particle sorbed) compound concentration in air. The fraction f ap of the total tracer concentration in air sorbed by aerosol particles is needed to estimate the dry particle deposition flux. It can be calculated based on an empiric relation which assumes that the equilibrium between the gaseous and aerosol particles bound fractions is determined by the substance vapour pressure and is independent of the particles chemical properties (Junge, 1977;Pankow, 1987) f ap =s•θ /(P ol + s•θ), where P ol is the temperature dependent saturated vapour pressure for supercooled liquid (Pa), calculated in a way similar to Eq. (A1). The specific aerosol surface θ (m 2 m -3 ) and adsorption constant s (Pa m) used in this study (Table 1) are constants and represent the North Sea conditions (Pekar et al., 1998).\n\nDue to their semi-volatility POPs are episodically scavenged from the atmosphere by precipitation in both the gas and particulate phases (Pankow, 1987, Bidleman, 1988). During wet periods the removal of gaseous and particle sorbed compounds dominate other depositional processes. Because precipitation is intermittent and a local phenomenon, it is crucial to consider its spatial and temporal variability.\n\nThe wet deposition flux F wet (ng m -2 s -1 ) is calculated in FANTOM as a product of the tracer concentration in precipitation C pr (ng l -1 ) which includes both the dissolved and particulate phases and precipitation rate P (m s -1 ) F wet = C pr •P.\n\nSpatial and temporal distributions of C pr and P are based on measurements as described in Section 2.5.4. In the present model configuration no distinction is made between precipitation scavenging of vapours and particles.\n\n(Appendix D). The organic carbon-water equilibrium partition coefficient K oc (l kg -1 ) is commonly employed in modelling organic chemicals (Koziol and Pudykiewicz, 2001;Malanichev et al., 2004) to calculate their partitioning in different aquatic particulate matrices. The K oc value is compound specific and related to the dimensionless octanol-water partition coefficient K ow according to Karickhoff (1981) as K oc = 0.411•K ow . The octanol-water partition coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in octanol and in water at equilibrium at a specified temperature (Karickhoff, 1981). Octanol is an organic solvent that is used as a surrogate for natural organic matter. This approach to describe the phase partitioning in water is appropriate for the fast uptake into the organic matrix. The uptake process may be far from the equilibrium during higher biological activity (i.e. during fast phytoplankton growth). Then a kinetic description would be more adequate (Skoglund et al., 1996;Axelman et al., 1997).\n\nT.Ilyina et al. / Journal of Marine Systems 63 (2006) 1-19"
