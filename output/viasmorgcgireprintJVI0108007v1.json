    "abstract": "Interferon α/β (IFN) immune defenses are essential for resistance to viruses and can be triggered through the actions of the cytoplasmic helicases RIG-I and MDA5. Signaling by each is initiated by the recognition of viral products such as RNA and occurs through downstream interaction with the IPS-1 adaptor protein. We directly compared innate immune signaling requirements of RIG-I, MDA5, and IPS-1 by representative viruses of the Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Reoviridae. In cultured fibroblasts, IPS-1 was essential for innate immune signaling of downstream IRF-3 activation and ISG expression but the requirement for RIG-I and MDA5 was variable. Each were individually dispensable for signaling triggered by reovirus and dengue virus whereas RIG-I was essential for signaling by influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus. Functional genomics analyses identified cellular genes triggered during influenza A virus infection whose expression was strictly dependent on RIG-I and are involved in processes of innate or adaptive immunity, apoptosis, cytokine signaling, and inflammation associated with the host response to contemporary and pandemic strains of influenza virus. These results define IPS-1-dependent signaling as an essential feature of host immunity to RNA virus infection. Our observations further demonstrate differential and redundant roles for RIG-I and MDA5 in pathogen recognition and innate immune signaling that may reflect unique and shared biologic properties of RNA viruses whose differential triggering and control of gene expression may impact pathogenesis and infection.",
    "full_text": "RNA viruses comprise approximately 80% of all viruses and in humans are etiologic agents of infectious diseases that pose major public health concerns (8). Despite differences in genomic features and replication strategies, RNA viruses can trigger common cellular components during infection to elicit an innate immune response that serves as a first line of protection against infection (19,38,41). The rapid production of α/β interferon (IFN) is a central and essential component of this response leading to induced expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) whose products direct antiviral and immunomodulatory actions that can limit infection (38).\n\nRIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic DExD/H box helicases that can detect intracellular viral products such as genomic RNA to signal IFN production in infected cells (41).\n\nSignaling by each occurs through homotypic caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) interactions with the IPS-1 adaptor protein (20,27,35,39), which recruits them to the outer membrane of the mitochondria as part of a macromolecular signaling complex that serves to activate downstream activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and other transcription factors that induce IFN and ISG expression (15). Although RIG-I and MDA5 may share similar signaling features (42) and structural homology (43), accumulating evidence suggest that the two helicases may discriminate among different ligands to trigger the innate immune response to RNA viruses. Signaling by RIG-I is triggered during infection by a number of RNA viruses and by the presence of synthetic RNA transcribed in vitro (18,24,26,33,37). More recently, RIG-I has been implicated in the recognition of RNA moieties that harbor 5' tri-phosphate ends (14,31,32) or RNA that assume complex secondary structures (33,37). In contrast, signaling by MDA5 is\n\nuniquely triggered during picornavirus infections or in the presence of a synthetic RNA polymer consisting of annealing strands of inosine and cytosine, poly(I:C) (11,18). To investigate how viruses from distinct genera initiate the innate immune response, we assessed the requirement for RIG-I, MDA5 and IPS-1 during infection with a panel of RNA viruses. Through functional genomic analyses, we further characterize host genes whose expression is dependent on RIG-I during influenza virus infection. Our results define an essential role for IPS-1 and demonstrate unique and redundant roles for RIG-I and MDA5 in RNA virus signaling of the innate immune response to infection. We provide the first identification of a RIG-I-responsive gene bioset whose expression has been linked with immunity and disease during influenza A virus infection.\n\nCells, viruses and reagents. RIG-I -/-, MDA5 -/-and IPS-1 -/-and corresponding wildtype (wt) mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were generated from age-matched knockout and wt mice with C57BL/6 (B6) background as described (11,18,22). RIG-I and MDA5 doubleknockout cells were generated by infecting RIG-I -/-MEFs with lentivirus particles that expressed a MDA5-targeting set of short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). As a negative control, RIG-I -/-MEFs were infected with lentivirus particles that expressed a non-targeting control shRNA.\n\nBriefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with individual clones from the Sigma Mission shRNA targeting set NM_027835 or the non-targeting control shRNA plasmid along with a lentivirus packaging plasmid according to manufacturer's recommendations. Cell culture supernatant containing lentivirus particles were collected at 24\n\nwas titrated on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by assaying for fluorescent-forming units (FFU) at 24 to 48hrs post-infection. Stocks of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were prepared from HeLa cells using virus stock obtained from M. E. Peeples (Ohio State University). Infected HeLa cells and culture medium were collected at 48 hrs post-infection. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, and lysed by successive cycles of freezing and thawing. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant pooled with the previously collected culture medium. Virus was concentrated with the addition of 50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, FW=8000) in NTE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris base pH 7.2, 10 mM EDTA) to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) PEG, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm. The virus pellet was reconstituted in 20% sucrose in NTE buffer, and further purified by sedimentation using a discontinuous gradient of 35 and 60% (w/v) sucrose in NTE buffer that was centrifuged at 37000 rpm for 1hr at 4 °C. The purified virus stock was titrated on HeLa cells and assayed for FFU at 48hrs post-infection. Stocks of the human RSV A-2 strain were prepared from HeLa cells using virus stock purchased from ATCC (VR-1540) and purified as previously described for the GFPtagged RSV.\n\nSendai virus (SenV, Cantell strain) was obtained from Charles River Laboratory. The NS1-deletion recombinant influenza virus, its wt counterpart A/PR/8/34 (PR8), influenza strains A/Udorn/1972 (Udorn) and B/Yamagata, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) to the NP and NS1 proteins of influenza A and B viruses were from A. García-Sastre (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and R. M. Krug (University of Texas at Austin). Type 3 Dearing (T3D) and type 1 Lang (T1L) reoviruses, and rabbit pAb to reoviruses were gifts from B. Sherry (North Carolina\n\nState University). Dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) was a gift from L. Gehrke (Massachusetts\n\nRabbit pAb to RIG-I and Mx-1 were produced in rabbits by repeated injections of purified recombinant RIG-I protein or synthetic peptides to Mx-1 respectively at the UT Southwestern Antibody Core facility. Rabbit pAb to ISG54 and ISG56 were a gift from G. Sen (Cleveland Clinic); Rabbit pAb to ISG15 was a gift from A. Haas (Louisiana State University).\n\nThe remaining antisera described in this paper were obtained from commercial sources: Abcam (mouse monoclonal Ab to dengue virus NS1), Charles River Laboratory (chicken pAb to NDV), Molecular Probes (rabbit pAb to GFP), Santa Cruz (goat pAb to actin), Biodesign International (goat pAb to SenV), Chemicon International (chicken pAb to RFP), Zymed (rabbit pAb to IRF-3), and Axxora (rabbit pAb to IPS-1 and MDA5).\n\nRenilla-luc and IFN-β-luc constructs have been described (9); siRNA to RIG-I (Genome SMARTpool to human DDX58), IPS-1 (Genome SMARTpool to human KIAA1271) and a nontargeting control siRNA were obtained from Ambion. The sequences of the siRNA to IPS-1 and the non-targeting control siRNA were previously described (26). The set of siRNA duplexes used to silence RIG-I expression in this study included the following: (i) 5'-CAGAAGAUCUUGAGGAUAAUU-3', (ii) 5'-GCACAGAAGUGUAUAUUGGUU-3', (iii) 5'-AGACAUGGGUAUAGAGUUAUU-3', and (iv) 5'-CAACCGAUAUCAUUUCUGAUU-3'.\n\nProtein Expression Analysis. Protein extracts from infected cells were prepared by lysing cells in extraction buffer (50mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NNP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/mL aprotonin, leupeptin and pepstatin, 1mM sodium vanadate and 1 mM sodium fluoride) followed by 4 °C centrifugation at 16,000 x G for 15 min. The supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. We note that ISG56 expression levels typically varied from undetectable to a low basal level in primary MEFs (see results), and is likely a reflection of subtle differences in culture conditions. Differences in viral growth were also noted in the different mouse fibroblast cell lines. We attribute these potential differences to cell population differences of phenotype that is often observed within in vitro studies and/or that could be linked to other unknown features of MDA5 or IPS-1 function.\n\nFor promoter luciferase reporter assays, cells were co-transfected with Renilla-luc and IFN-β-luc constructs and simultaneously transfected with the appropriate pool of siRNA or a non-targeting siRNA using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were either infected with virus or mock-infected 24hrs after transfections. At the indicated times, cell extracts were collected and analyzed for dual-luciferase activity as described (9).\n\nImmunostaining and fluorescent microscopy. Cells were seeded in chamber slides and infected with virus or mock infected as indicated in the text. At the indicated times postinfection, cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, incubated in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum. The slides were then sequential stained\n\nwith the appropriate dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies, and washed before Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) was applied. Slides were sealed under coverslips and examined by immunofluorescent microscopy using an Axiovert phase contrast microscope in the UT Southwestern Pathogen Imaging Facility.\n\nExpression microarray format and data analysis. Microarray formats, and protocols for probe labeling and array hybridization are described at http://expression.viromics.washington.edu. Briefly, a single experiment comparing two mRNA samples was done with four replicate Mouse (V2) 22K oligonucleotide expression arrays (Agilent Technologies) using the dye label reverse technique. This allows for the calculation of mean ratios between expression levels of each gene in the analyzed sample pair, standard deviation and P values for each experiment. Spot quantitation, normalization and application of a platform-specific error model was performed using Agilent's Feature Extractor software and all data was then entered into a custom-designed database, Expression Array Manager, and then uploaded into Rosetta Resolver System 6.0.0.2.8. Taqman (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics 8.1 (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Data normalization and the Resolver Error Model are described on the website http://expression.viromics.washington.edu. This website is also used to publish all primary data in accordance with the proposed MIAME standards (3). Selection of genes for data analysis was based on a greater than 99% probability of being differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.01) and a fold change of 2 or greater in at least two experiments.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to validate the gene expression changes and measure A/PR/8/34 HA and NP RNA expression in infected MEFs.\n\nResults of the qPCR for select genes are presented in Fig. 5C and additional data is available upon request. Total RNA samples were treated with DNA-free DNase Treatment and Removal Reagents (Ambion, Austin, TX). Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer primers and Taqman RT reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR system and Taqman chemistry. Each target was run in triplicate with Taqman 2X PCR Universal Master Mix and a 20-µL total reaction volume.\n\nPrimer and probe sets for relative quantification were selected from the Assays-on-Demand product list (Applied Biosystems) including endogenous controls and 18 S ribosomal RNA.\n\nQuantification of each gene, relative to the calibrator, was calculated according to Pfaffl (30).\n\nBriefly, expression values were calculated using the equation: ratio=(E target ) ∆CPtarget(control-\n\nWe conducted functional studies to directly compare the roles of RIG-I, MDA5 and IPS-1 in innate immunity against members of the paramyxovirus, flavivirus, reovirus, and\n\northomyxovirus families. Studies from knockout mice have shown that RIG-I is essential for the innate immune response to the nonhuman paramyxoviruses, Sendai virus (SenV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (14). We therefore conducted initial experiments to compare innate immune signaling and response in cells infected with SenV, NDV, or with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a human pathogen of public health importance (5,23,36). Paramyxoviruses encode a monopartite genome of negative-sense single-stranded RNA (8). Infection of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by SenV triggered accumulation of the active, nuclear isoforms of IRF-3 in wildtype (wt) and MDA5 -/-cells, but infection failed to induce IRF-3 nuclear translocation in RIG-I -/-cells (Fig. 1A). IRF-3 distribution was also predominantly cytoplasmic in uninfected cells. In side-by-side immunoblot analyses, SenV, NDV and RSV infection induced the expression of IRF-3-dependent genes including ISG15, ISG54, and ISG56 in wt and MDA5 -/-cells but not in RIG-I -/-cells (Fig. 1B and C). In the case of RSV, RIG-I was essential for signaling innate immune defenses against both a clinical strain and a recombinant virus that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with a recent study showing RIG-I-dependent cytokine and TLR3 expression in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells (24). Thus, RIG-I but not MDA5 is essential for triggering innate immune defenses against RSV and other paramyxoviruses. Cells lacking RIG-I were overall more permissive to RSV and NDV infection than were wt or MDA5 -/-cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that RIG-I actions restrict initial infection. We found that while MDA5 is not essential for innate immune activation by paramyxoviruses, virus-induced gene expression in MDA5 -/-cells was relatively attenuated or delayed compared to wt cells (see Fig. 1B and C), suggesting that MDA5 may play an auxiliary role in amplifying innate immune signaling initiated by RIG-I during paramyxovirus infection. It should be noted that SenV, NDV and RSV infections also led to the\n\naccumulation of RIG-I and MDA5 protein in wt cells. MDA5 expression was not readily detectable above background levels in the absence of RIG-I during paramyxovirus infection.\n\nWe further examined the role of RIG-I and MDA5 in the innate immune response to infection by dengue virus (DEN2), a Flavivirus encoding a monopartite positive sense singlestranded RNA genome, and prototypic reovirus encoding a multipartite double-stranded RNA genome of two distinct serotypes: Type 1 Lang (reo T1L) and Type 3 Dearing (reo T3D) (8).\n\nWhereas reo T3D exhibits severe neurovirulence and high fatality when injected into infant mice, infection with reo T1L is rarely fatal and exhibits considerably milder symptoms (1).\n\nInfection by DEN2 triggered the expression of IRF-3-responsive genes in wt, RIG-I -/-and MDA5 -/-cells and concomitant accumulation of IRF-3 in the nuclei of infected cells (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Reovirus infection of MEFs similarly triggered ISG expression, albeit to different degrees, and this response occurred with absence of either RIG-I or MDA5 (Fig. 2B).\n\nHowever, neither RIG-I -/-nor MDA5 -/-cells attained wt levels of virus-induced gene expression during DEN2 or reovirus infection. Furthermore, although RIG-I and MDA5 expression increased in each case following virus infection, only wt cells attained the highest levels of expression. These results indicate that RIG-I and MDA5 are independently dispensable for the innate immune signaling during dengue virus or reovirus infection. Alternatively, our results may indicate the involvement of a yet to be defined cytoplasmic receptor other than RIG-I or MDA5 in innate immune signaling during DEN2 or reovirus infection. To examine this possibility, MDA5 expression in RIG-I -/-MEFs was silenced by shRNA to generate doubleknockout cells lacking both RIG-I and MDA5. DEN2 and reovirus T3D both triggered robust ISG expression in RIG-I -/-cells that had been treated with a non-targeting shRNA control (Fig.\n\n2C, Neg). In contrast, DEN2 or reovirus T3D infection triggered little or no ISG expression in the double-knockout cells that directly correlated with MDA5 expression levels despite robust viral replication. These results indicate that DEN2 and reoviruses trigger both RIG-I and MDA5dependent innate immune responses in mouse fibroblasts.\n\nRIG-I and MDA5 signal downstream immune actions through the essential adaptor protein, IPS-1 (15). To determine the requirement for signaling by either RIG-I or MDA5 in the innate immune response to DEN2 and reovirus infection, we examined whether IPS-1 was required for triggering virus-induced gene expression. In control experiments, cells lacking IPS-1 failed to signal IRF-3 nuclear translocation and lacked ISG expression upon SenV infection (Fig. 3A). Similarly, when infected with either reo T3D or DEN2, IPS-1 -/-cells failed to induce IRF-3-dependent gene expression beyond basal background levels (Fig. 3B) nor did they trigger IRF-3 nuclear translocation following DEN2 (Fig. 3C) and reo T3D infection (data not shown). To verify these results, we measured IFN-β promoter signaling in HeLa cells transfected with siRNA targeted to IPS-1 or RIG-I. Cells were then mock infected or infected with SenV or DEN2, and assessed for IFN-β promoter activation. As expected, knockdown of RIG-I expression abrogated IFN-β promoter activation by SenV, but had only a partial impact on promoter signaling by DEN2 (Fig. 3D). Importantly knockdown of IPS-1 completely abrogated signaling to the IFN-β promoter induced by SenV or DEN2. Thus, IPS-1 is essential for triggering innate immune defenses during infection with SenV, dengue virus or reovirus. Taken together, our results suggest that reovirus and dengue virus signal the innate defenses through an IPS-1-regulated pathway that is likely initiated by either RIG-I or MDA5.\n\nWe also directly compared and assessed the role of RIG-I and MDA5 in triggering innate immune actions during orthomyxovirus infection. Influenza A virus and influenza B virus are orthomyxoviruses, each encoding a multipartite genome comprised of single-stranded, negative sense RNA (8). We found that the A/PR/8/34 (Fig. 4A) or the A/Udorn strain (data not shown) of influenza virus triggered IRF-3 nuclear accumulation within a low frequency of cells in cultures of wt (Fig. 4A) or MDA5 -/-MEFs (data not shown). Uninfected cells show typical cytoplasmic staining of IRF-3 (See Fig. 4A). In parallel experiments, we found that nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 occurred within a larger frequency of cells during infection of cultures with an isogenic mutant virus, A/PR/8delNS1 that expresses a truncated NS1 gene (data not shown). This is in support of previous findings that the A/PR/8/34 influenza virus NS1 protein can attenuate RIG-I signaling of IRF-3 activation (12,28,29,31). Importantly, IRF-3 was never observed to accumulate in the nuclei of influenza virus-infected RIG-I -/-cells (Fig. 4A).\n\nImmunoblot analysis revealed that each strain of influenza A virus (Fig. 4B) as well as the B/Yamagata strain of influenza B virus (Fig. 4C) triggered innate response gene expression and a concomitant increase of RIG-I and MDA5 protein levels in a manner that was completely dependent on RIG-I. We note that influenza B virus triggered a reduced response in MDA5 -/cells, which suggests that MDA5 may play a supportive role in signaling the innate immune response to influenza B virus infection. Alternatively, the reduced response may be a direct truncation NS1 mutant influenza A virus. In further experiments we transfected Huh7 cells or Huh7.5 cells with a synthetic double-stranded RNA polymer consisting of annealing strands of inosine and cytosine poly(I:C), or with influenza virus genomic RNA (vRNA) isolated from the A/PR/8/34 strain. Huh7 cells are competent for signaling through the RIG-I pathway and signals innate immune activation in response to poly(I:C) whereas Huh7.5 cells encode defective RIG-I\n\nand cannot mediate RIG-I-dependent signaling (37). Influenza virus vRNA and the poly(I:C) control RNA both activated the IFN-β promoter reporter in Huh7 cells (Fig. 4E). However, neither the vRNA nor poly(I:C) control were able to trigger IFN-β promoter signaling in the absence of functional RIG-I in Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, when infected with either influenza A/PR/8/34 or A/Udorn/1972 viruses, cells lacking IPS-1 failed to induce expression of ISG beyond basal background levels (Fig. 4F). Taken together, our results demonstrate that RIG-I is essential for triggering the innate immune response to influenza A virus and influenza B virus, and indicate that the orthomyxoviruses signal innate defenses through the IPS-1 adaptor protein.\n\nOur observations validate influenza A virus genomic RNA (vRNA) as a trigger of RIG-I signaling (31), and indicate that vRNA contains signatures or specific motifs that present a pathogen associated molecular pattern recognized by RIG-I and sufficient to trigger the innate immune response to infection.\n\nTo further define the role of RIG-I in signaling host gene expression, we conducted functional genomics analyses to define the cellular genes whose expression is controlled by RIG-I during influenza A virus infection. We designed our bioinformatics analysis to identify RIG-Iresponsive genes in cells by comparing wt and RIG-I -/-cells that had been mock-infected, or\n\ninfected with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus for 8 or 26 hrs. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes in RIG-I -/-cells far exceeded those of wt cells after influenza A/PR/8/34 virus infection at both time points (Fig. 5A). Our data shows that infection with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus triggered the expression of a number of immune-related genes that are not expressed or whose expression is altered in the absence of RIG-I (Fig. 5B). In particular, RIG-I -/-cells show a profound lack of expression of a bioset of genes whose products are involved in innate defenses during influenza A virus infection. Consistent with the immunoblot results, we found that IFN gene expression is significantly attenuated in the absence of RIG-I (see expression of IFNα6 and IFNβ; Fig. 5B and 5C). There was also a lack of expression of genes whose products are involved in IFN production and signaling (such as IRF3, IRF7, Stat1 and Stat2), and ISGs with direct antiviral actions including PKR, OAS, Mx-1, ISG54, ISG56 and Viperin in RIG-I -/cells (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Moreover, TLR3 and MDA5 (Ifih1) expression was overall attenuated in RIG-I -/-cells.\n\nExpression profiling also showed that there was a lack of expression of several genes involved in antigen presentation and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in RIG-I -/cells (Fig. 5D), suggesting that RIG-I signaling may further impact those immune processes during influenza A virus infection. Absence of RIG-I also resulted in reduced expression of a subset of genes following influenza A/PR/8/34 virus infection (Fig. 5A), suggesting that RIG-I may further regulate the maintenance of basal level gene expression of these genes. In contrast, the expression of genes involved in TLR signaling of the proinflammatory response, apoptosis, and IL-1 signaling of chemokine secretion were elevated in the absence of RIG-I (Fig. 5D), and the primary microarray data for these genes is available on the website:\n\nhttp://expression.viromics.washington.edu. Viral gene expression was further verified by qPCR, and the analyses showed that at all times tested, viral HA and NP genes were transcribed to higher levels in RIG-I -/-cells compared to wild type cells (Fig. 5E). Taken together, our results indicate that influenza viruses can engage RIG-I during infection, resulting in innate immune signaling and induction of genes broadly involved in immunity and inflammation.\n\nResults from this study show that IPS-1 is essential for signaling the innate immune response to a wide range of RNA viruses from diverse genera with distinct genome and replication characteristics. The universal requirement for IPS-1 in these examples is unusual given the typical redundancy observed in most immune signaling processes. By playing a central role in innate immune signaling during RNA virus infections, IPS-1 presents an attractive target for virus control of host defenses, wherein viral strategies to disrupt IPS-1 function can provide effective means of innate immune evasion. Indeed, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) targets IPS-1 through the actions of the viral NS3/4A protease, which cleaves IPS-1 to inactivate its signaling properties (16,26,27). Similarly, pathogenic pestiviruses and hepatitis A virus proteolytically target and inactivate IPS-1 (7,40). IPS-1 signaling is initiated by ligand-induced CARD-CARD interaction with either RIG-I or MDA5 (20,26,33), which facilitates their recruitment to the mitochondria as part of a macromolecular signaling complex . The interaction with IPS-1 is thought to stimulate the actions of this signaling complex to activate IRFs and NF-kB (13,44).\n\nImportantly, the mitochondrial localization of IPS-1 must be maintained in order to support these signaling functions (26,35). The requirement for mitochondrial placement of IPS-1 indicates that\n\nits function requires mitochondrial co-factors that cooperate in factor recruitment and/or IPS-1 signaling actions. By extension, our results imply that mitochondrial co-factors of IPS-1 signaling play an essential role in innate immunity against the genera of RNA viruses examined in the current study.\n\nProgress has been made in discerning the molecular signatures recognized by RIG-I during virus infection but it is still unclear what minimal features are required for virus recognition by MDA5. In other work and in this study, RIG-I has been shown to trigger innate immune defenses during infection by paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and the vesicular stomatitis rhabdovirus (18,41), and is suggested to play a role in recognizing the single-stranded RNA genome of the filovirus Ebola ( 4), and EBER RNA encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (34) (see Fig. 6). In contrast, MDA5 triggers innate immune defenses uniquely during picornavirus infections (11,18). Despite similarities in genomic features and replication strategies, members of the Flaviviridae exhibit differential triggering of the innate immune response. Whereas Japanese encephalitis virus and HCV initiated a primarily RIG-I-dependent response (6,18,26,37), strains of West Nile virus (10) and dengue virus triggered RIG-I-and MDA5-dependent signaling, suggesting that flaviviruses may encode genomic features that can be discerned by both RIG-I and MDA5. Results from our study therefore substantiate accumulating evidence for unique and redundant roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in signaling that converges on IPS-1 to direct innate immunity during virus infection. Identification of the specific molecular patterns or features that trigger RIG-I or MDA5 signaling may lead to targeted and specific antiviral strategies against infection.\n\nFunctional genomic analyses show that infection with contemporary strains of influenza A virus typically triggers the rapid expression of immune-related genes responsible for mediating transient immune responses that effectively resolves infection (2). Recent studies by Kash et al. and Kobasa et al. provide evidence that infection with the 1918 pandemic strain of influenza A virus triggers the persistent expression of an overlapping pool of immune-related genes (17,21).\n\nExcessive triggering of these genes lead to induction of a \"cytokine storm\" that is not only ineffectual in facilitating viral clearance, but is indicated as a contributing factor of disease (25).\n\nImportantly, many of these disease-related genes induced by pandemic influenza virus infection are present in the bioset of RIG-I-responsive genes identified in our functional genomics studies.\n\nThus the processes that trigger and control RIG-I-signaling during virus infection, and the products of RIG-I responsive genes, may be important determinants of viral pathogenesis and disease outcome during influenza A virus infection. infection.

Summary of published results and corresponding references demonstrating virus induced RIG-I and MDA5 signaling of the innate immune response. Genomic features of viruses are described in brief: Positive (+) vs. negativesense (-); single-stranded (ssRNA) vs. double-stranded RNA (dsRNA); segmented (S) vs. nonsegmented (NS) genomes. In fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and certain immune cells, signaling by RIG-I and MDA5 converge on IPS-1 to rapidly trigger IFN production and ISG expression.
