We define a sequence m(x) by the recursion (3) ro(x) = x, m+l (x) = TI m(x) (a =o, I, -) and put (4) It is easy to see that qn+i = c&z+1 (x) = 2 s q?a 5 qnt1 Evidently, if x is given by (l), we have (5) r,(x) = &+ l +--a. qn+1 qn+2\n\nIf x is rational, x= 3, then Tix = $ with a' < a.

It is easy to see that for irrational values of x one has lim qTt(x) =+ 60.\n\nn*m\n\nIn the present paper we investigate the metrical properties' of the sequence qTt(x). The results obtained may be characterized as follows. Let us consider the interval (0, 1) as the space of elementary events, and interpret the Lebesgue measure of a measurable subset of the interval (0,l) as its probability. Then the random variables x, = log ql, xn = log & (n =2, 3, . ,.) are in a certain sense almost independent, and almost identically distributed, and thus for (61 similar results are valid as for the partial sums of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, e. g. the central limit theorem, the laws of large numbers, the law of the iterated logarithm, etc.\n\nIn 55 l-5 we deal with Engel's series: in $j 1 some fundamental identities are deduced ; in ยง 2 we prove the central limit theorem for the logqn-sums (6), i. e. we prove that the distribution of ~jhi tends for n-+ 00 to the normal distribution (Theorem 2). In 5 3 we prove the strong law of large numbers for the sum (6), i. e. that for almost all x lim ~~C-~ (Theorem 3). In 5 4 we give some inequalities which are used in 3 5 to prove the law of the iterated logarithm for the sums (6), i. e. that for almost. all x ,z V~g146;~$ = + 1 and z ,;-Fgl 'iLin = -1. (Theorem 4).\n\nL?O : no Theorems 2,3, and 4 are not new. Theorem 3 has been stated without proof in a short note by I% BOREL\" in 1947 ( [3] ; see also [4]. In the same year, in his paper [5] P. LEVY announced Theorems 2 and 4. P. LEVY sketched also the proof of these theorems, as well as that of Theorem 3. He pointed out that if x is uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1) the random variables &,+1 = -log [(q?, (x)-l) r,,(x)] (n = 1, 2, . , .) are exactly exponentially distributed with mean 1, and they are also almost (but not exactly) indepen-\n\nwith probability near to 1 very near to x,?+l= log _ q*, ( 4for large n the same holds for these quantities too, and this is the real ground -as pointed out above -of the validity of Theorems 2, 3 and 4.\n\n1 In a recent paper [2] one of the authors considered the metrical fheory of a general class of representations of real numbers, but the representations by means of Engel's and Sylvester's series do not belon, g to the class of representations considered in (21. They belong, however, to the class of representations considered by L. BERG [16].\n\n3 BOREL called Engel's series of the first kind \"dkveloppement unitaire normal\".\n\nHowever, P. LEVY did not go into details. It seems to us that -owing to the fact that the variables &+I are not exactly independent, these details (especially in case of the law of the iterated logarithm) would be rather cumbersome. Therefore we thought it worth while to work out detailed proofs of these theorems. We have chosen a way which is different from that of LEVY, as we made ample use of the explicit formulae given in 5 1 for the probability distribution of q,,, resp. the conditional probability distribution of q?l+nL , when the value of q,,l is fixed. Besides these formulae we utiiised also the remark, made in 5 1 that the random variables qT1 form a Markov chain.\n\nIn 5 6 we consider Sylvester's series (called also \"Engel's series of the second kind\", see the first edition of [l]\n\nSylvester's series ' of a real number x (0 <x < 1) is (7) x=&+&+ ..* +&+... where Q1,Q2,... are positive integers, defined as follows:\n\nWe denote by T,x the transformation\n\nx We define the sequence R,,{x) by the recursion (9) R,1 (x) = x, R,,, l(x) = T?

Clearly, if x is rational, x=a then T,x=a with a'ca; b' b' thus R,,(x)= 0 for some 1' and therefore every rational number % has a finite representation 1 $== + &+ . . . + $ . For irrational values of x we I' have lim Qal (x) = + 00 and n-to) R,,(x)=++++--(I7 7 0, 1, . . .). llfl ,lf3\n\nPutting X1 = log Q1, X, = log Qiml (n = 2,'3,. . .) we shall see that the random variables X,, are in a certain sense almost independent and 3 SYLVESTER\n\n[6] called the expansion (7) a \"sorites\". See also [7] for further bibliography.\n\nalmost identically distributed. Thus we obtain (Theorem 5.) that the centr;ll limit theorem holds for log Qn\n\nAs regards Qll we shall prove (Theorem 6) that the limit lim R R-f03 2 exists for almost all x, but its value may depend on x.\n\nThese results concerning QB are according to our knowledge new. In 9 7, some number-theoretic questions concerning Engel's and Sylvester's series are discussed, and some unsolved problems are mentioned.\n\nIn what follows we shall interpret the Lebesgue measure of the set of those real numbers x (0 < x < 1) for which some relation concerning the sequence qn= q%(x) holds, as the probability of the relation in question, and shall denote it by P(. . -), where in the bracket the relation in question will be indicated. The conditional probability of A with respect to the condition B will be denoted by P(d 123).\n\nAs clearly q,t =4*&(x)= k (k = 2,3, . . .) if and only if x is lying in some interval where 2 5 q1 5 qa s.. '5 q+-l 5 k, and these intervals do not overlap, we have\n\naa~~n~z...~~,,-~~rc qiq2.. . q+1' Similarly we obtain that the conditional probability of the joint occurrence of q,+r+l = kl, q,+,.+2 = b , . . . , q,+,.+$ = k, under the condition that the values of 41,4!2, . . ., qn are given, is 0. (For r=O the empty sum is to be replaced by 1.)\n\nAs the conditional probability (1.2) does not depend on the values of 41992, * * *, q,+l (only on the value of qn) and it does not depend on the number n either, the sequence qlE, considered as a sequence of random vari-ables on the probability space furnished by the interval (0, 1) the probability measure being the Lebesgue measure, is a homogeneous Markov chain. The transition probabilities of this Markov chain can be obtained for r = 0, s= 1 from (1.2) and are given by (l-3) q, = P(qn+l = klq,, =j) = k[k-;l) (ksjz:).\n\nIt follows that the probabilities p,(k) can be obtained by the following recursion formulae :\n\n(k= 2, 3, . . .), (k, n = 2, 3, . . .).\n\nFrom (1. 1) we obtain . . . We have (In (1. 7) we considered the first occurrence of k in the sequence q+?, therefore we supposed 4+1 5 k-l instead of qR--l s k.) We may calculate similarly the probability ek(r) that the digit k occurs exactly r times (r= 0, 1,. . .) in the sequence q,t. We obtain THEOREM 1. The probability that the digit k occurs exactly r times in the sequence q>%(x) is given by (1.8) k-l ek(r> =x k' (r = 0, 1, . . . ; k = 2, 3, . . .).\n\nUsing (1.5) we may obtain an explicit formula for pli(k). Taking into account that we obtain We have by (1. 12)\n\nAs q.,, tends with probability 1 to + bo, and as well known, it follows that (1.23) logN=l$;+~..+N+-y+o(*)7\n\n22) and (1.23) together prove Lemma 1. Q 2. The central limit theorem for Engel's series In this ยง we shall need the following LEMMA 2. 2 e 5 (gr (n = 1,2, . . .). 1. PROOF. Taking into account that by virtue of (1.4) for 12 2, we obtain that As @$s+ , our Lemma follows. Now we can THEOREM 2 (P. L&Y). Fur any real y we have prove log qa--n By other wordsyn-is in the limit normally distributed for n + 00. PROOF. Let us put (2-l) x,=logq,, x,=log.k 41th1 (n = 2,3, . . .) and (2. -2) yn=logq,=x,Sxa+.~~$x,, further (2, 3)\n\nTo prove Theorem 2 it suffices to show (see e. g. [S]) that (2.4) for any real t. Let us put (2.5) First we shall show that\n\nThis can be obtained as follows. We have and thus by (I.\n\n3) (2-f% As I; 7 (2.9) -$logf. ;;ky;) -q(t)1 5 &+& J ~eitlogLpwl $ k-l T k-l and as for -k 1 fxsl and kzlfl we have it follows that e dog; -,,llogr ItI 214 -==z -5 ___ =k-l-/+1' (2.10) t,ll\"g+ (f---l) -y(f> s 3+$'[. h=E k(k-1) Thus, taking into account that (2. 11) 5%~l(f) = &-l(l)e~tlop\", i it follows from (2. 8) and (2. 10) that (2. 12) I~,i(f)--(f)~,,,-l(f)/ z (3+2/Qig \";'I;':' . Applying Lemma 2 we obtain (2. 6). Let us apply (2. 6) for n--r instead of n and multiply it by y(f). It follows (2.13) 12y*(f)SPll~r(f)-~+l(f)gp,-,-l(f)l s (3+2~fJ)(-g~-~-1. Adding (2. 13) for r=O, 1, . . ., n-m-l we obtain (2.14) I~lz(f)---\"(f)~,,,(f)j s (12+8p/) [+j: Now we have clearly for any fixed value of m (2. 15) and (2.16) and therefore\n\n(2. 17)\n\nAs we may choose the value of m arbitrarily large, we obtain (2.4). Thus Theorem 1 is proved.\n\nIt can be seen from the proof that the random variables x,, behave approximately as if they were independent and distributed according to the exponential distribution with mean 1. The latter assertion can be expressed also by saying that * 411 is for n --+ 00 in the limit uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1). This result can be deduced also directly from the remark of P. Lrivv mentioned in the introduction, that the random variable Me---l) u,, x is exactly uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1). c > 5 3. The strong law of large numbers for Engel's series\n\nIn this 5 we give a short proof of the following Theorem 3, which has b'een announced without proof by p. BOREL [3]. Though Theorem 3 is contained in Theorem 4 (the law of the iterated logarithm), we thought it worth while to give a direct proof of Theorem 3 because the proof of Theorem 4 is rather complicated. ',, THEOREM 3. (I? BOREL). For afmasf all x lim J$ =e.\n\n,ri c: PROOF. Let us choose an arbitrary s: > 0. We start from the formula (1. 15). We have evidently for 7-> 0 cc Thus we obtain LEMMA 3. There exists for any e > 0 u number q,(E) for which 0 < q, (8) < 1 nnd\n\nWpL(e'~(l+E)) s (q,(E;))ll for n 1 n,(E).\n\nClearly for q,(F) we may take any number satisfying max[+, (1 ++)e-\"~')ig,(y)C\n\n1.\n\nLEMMA 4. To any E (0 < E < 1) there exists a number q.,(F) such that 0 < q?(E) < 1 and\n\nS,,(e,@-z)) < q;(s) for n 2 IL(E).\n\nAs a matter of fact we have by (1. 16) for T > 0 (3.4) Choosing -T = T, as vei-\" is increasing and < 1 for 0 < 13 < 1 it follows that &(e+@\"') 5 2en (!l-+)e@)lel if n 2 n,(a), which proves (3. 3). It follows from Lemma 3 resp. Lemma 4 that the series The asymptotic behaviour of pn(k) resp. p,,(k(j) has been considered more thoroughly by A. B~KI%SY [9]. He proved e. g. that (4.13) for n-l 5 q =C 1. For our purposes, however, the estimates given in this Zlogk -5 are sufficient. OI zpi log q?,,,, -m _~ <-l--g $$=I 1 2m,, log log m,, 1 are convergent if ij > 0.\n\nWe shall prove in detail only the assertion concerning the inequality (5.5) as the proof for (5. ,j As, however, we do not consider here for an arbitrary function v(n) whether the inequality log ql, --n > \\ n q(n) is satisfied for almost all x for a finite or an infinite number of values of n, but restrict ourselves to the case I' = 2(1+ 8) log log n, we may take m,, ==[(I t F)\"] instead of m,, -[dogil] n-,eded in the general case.\n\n{Here and in what follows the product of events denotes the joint occurrence of the events in question,) The events Bt' (k z m,) clearly exclude each other, as B!i') means that k is the first index 2 m,, for which Al:(d) takes place. If the sum of events means that at least one of the events occurs, then we have evidently for any 1~ m,, If our assertion concerning (5.5) would not hold, i. e. if (5.5) would be satisfied for an infinity of values of n for all x belonging to a set having positive measure, we could find a constant c > 0 and for any positive integer n/r an other integer N >M such that P f7;y$,; AI@) 'I 2 c > 0 . I (c does not depend on M). Let us denote for m,, 5 k < m,,.,l by D,,,,: the event that 1% q\"Lilr2 -m,,+z z log qk -k. Clearly the joint occurrence of the events I$;\"' and D,,,,; implies the occurrence of A,,,,,g(q) if (1 + d) > (I + t,) (1 + e).\n\nIf 0 < 6 < I and we choose 0 < e < s and 0 < II< G, then this condition is clearly satisfied and we obtain 1\" ,8 i 1 and by Lemma 8 (5.11) P (D,l. 1; ,q1; = j) s CT wmilL2-li (e\"'\"'\"-\").\n\nThus (5. 12) P @I,?, k / BY) 2 Cl1 > 0 and therefore by (5. 9)\n\nIt follows that for any M there can be found a number N such that s-1 (5.14)\n\nz ccn > 0. 0=x But this is a contradiction because the series (5.7) is convergent. Thus our assertion that for almost all x (5.5) is satisfied only for a finite number of values of n is proved.\n\nThe corresponding statement for (5.6) is proved similarly. The only difference consists in that we need here Lemma 9 instead of Lemma 8. Now we turn to the proof of the other part of the theorem, i. e. we prove that (5.15) log q,t-->l--d v-2n1og log n resp.\n\n(5. 16) logqn.--<--1 +a -__ j.1'2n log log n are both satisfied for any infinity of values of n, for almost all x, if R > 0, which implies (5. 17) resp. (5.18) for almost all x.\n\nWe choose a q>l, m,, = [ql']. We denote by the value of which will be fixed later, and put C,,(Q) the event that the inequality As we already know that the set of those x for which log q,,,? -m,, )'im, log log m,, <-l--6 for nsM has the measure 0, it follows that the set for which log qjF7,, -m,, v2m,, log log m,L <l---d for n z M has also the measure 0, and this is what we want' to prove. Now we have clearly, as q,L is a Markov chain,\n\n(5.22) where (5. 23) i.,<+l = Max -1-d.:: logj,-m,, P ( CwLn+l (a) j qni,, = j,,). I';.'m,, log log 111,1 e: l-8\n\nWe now try to obtain an estimate from above for R,,+r. We have clearly, putting (5.24) k,, = p1&1-8) l-.l'\"nT1 log log my,,1\n\n(5.25) P (C'\",r+* (d) j qm,, =.A) 2 wn,(+pn,Lcrl~l Iin).\n\nWe shall give an estimate from below for the right hand side of (5.25).\n\nBy Lemma 8 we obtain, putting ~a,,== m,,+l-m,, If q is sufficiently large, then log k,, -m,, f (1 + d) v2m,, log log m,, < vvL + and in this case (5.27) As it follows by some easy calculation from Lemma 6 that the series is divergent, our assertion that follows. This proves (5. 17); clearly (5. 18) can be proved in the same way. Thus Theorem 4 is completely proved. We do not consider here the obvious generalizations of Theorem 4, though they may be treated in the same way (see footnote \").\n\nIn this ยง we consider Sylvester's series (Engel's series of the second kind) for a real number x (0 < x < 1) (6.\n\n1) x=5,+&+ . . . +kL+ . ..* We investigate some metrical properties of the denominators Qgl = Q,I(x). We have clearly (6.2) Q,~+I s Qa(Qo -1) + 1 and (6.3) provided that k,r2 and k,-l~kki(ki-l)+l (i=l,2,...,n-1). TINIS if these inequalities are satisfied, p\n\nThus fhe sequence Q,,(X) is a homogeneous Markov chain, whose transition probabilities are given by (6.5) if j2.Z and kzj(j-l)+l.\n\nIt follows that putting P,z(k)=P(Q,,= k) we have the recursion relations We obtain easily, similarly as in 5 2, (6. 12) thus, putting again q(t) = /'cdx, we have by Lemma 10 i (6. 13) l~~~(i)-~~(f)'l,...I(t)l~l;.(~~\"(l +jq>.\n\nNow we can apply the same method as in the proof of Theorem 2, and obtain thus THEOREM 5.\n\nfor any real y, i. e. log QlL Ql.. .Qr,-1 is in the limit normnlly distributed.\"\n\nThe result which we obtained is a consequence of the facts which have been proved implicitly above, that the random variables XI = log Q1, 1: Theorem 5 implies that 1:\n\nlQ,L QI-..Q,,_I tends in measure to e.

The proof will be published elsewhere,\n\nx,, = log -$ (II = 2, 3, . . .> are in a certain sense almost independent and the distribution of X,, tends for n--+m to the exponential distribution with mean 1. The latter fact can be also deduced from the remark that Qll(Q,,--l)R,, is for every n exactly uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1). As regards Qti itself, we can prove the following THEOREM 6.\n\nexists and is finite and positive for almost all x.\n\nPROOF. We have and as M(lX~/)sc,:~ (k= 1, 2, . , .), it follows by the theorem of B. LEVI [l I], that the limit in question exists for almost all x. It is easy to see that the limit is always positive. As a matter of fact, if the sequence S,, is defined by SI = 2, &+I = S,,( Consider now various special representations of the form (\n\n7. 1). First of all consider Sylvester's series of $, Denote by E,(a, b) the number of terms occurring in this series. From (7. 2) it follows that &(a, b) ~a and it is easy to see that this is best possible, since &(a, a! + 1) =a. We know of no good estimation of E,(a, 6) in terms of I, ; the trivia1 estimation &(a, b) < 6 is no doubt very far from being best possible. We remark that E,(a,b)=,f(a,b) e. g. &=$f+=i+++i$O'\n\ni. e. f&20) = 2 but &(9,20) = 3.\n\nIn 5 6 we proved that log Q,, ~ tends for almost all x to a limit, where 2', Q,? is the n-th denominator of the Sylvester's series of x. It follows from the divergence of the harmonic series that no function F(x, n) can be given so that for any representation x = i+ + +\n\n1 1 . ..+g+*... where S,, is a positive integer and S,, < .?Lfl, we should have S,, sk(x, n). But it seemed possible that for any such representation (7.4) 2% s Qw (x) infinitely often. Now we show that (7.4) is not always true. Let nk tend to + 60 sufficiently fast, and put Let &.+ 2n.'+ 1 l h h = &+ ... + &-be the Sylvester's series h of &+ I, + 2nl;+1 . A simple computation shows that 1, > 2 if nk > 1 and if 2nk+l > (SQ then kz $-& is the Sylvester's series of x and clearly here Q(X) < S,, for all sufficiently large n. It seems that (7.4) fails for almost all x.\n\nIt follows from the fact that a given x can not be approximated arbitrarily well by rational numbers with denominator 5 y that there exists for every x a function G(x, n) so that if x=,2&, then S,, < G{x, n) infinitely 1 , often. It is easy to find such a function G(x, n) for almost all x; e. g. for almost all x G(x, n) = (3 +E)~'\" has the mentioned property if e 3 0, but it seems difficult to give a good estimation for the smallest such function. Thus in particular we could not decide whether for almost all x there exists a series x= s$ (S,, positive integer, S,, < S,,,,) so that I, jim logs\" + -= co. ,r+CO 2\" Similar algorithms like that leading to Sylvester's series can be defined by replacing the harmonic series by some other series of positive terms (see e. g. [14]). For these algorithms similar questions can be asked. Now we consider Engel's series of the first kind of rational numbers, that is the representation fl -=b iI +-&+-.+q,q,.l..q * II Put ,!$(a, 6) = n. We have no non-trivial estimation of ,?,(a, 6). Clearly q,( 5 6 and the same value of qi can not occur too often; in this way one can obtain a very poor upper bound for E,(a, 6). Here too it would be interest-- where d,, is an integer d,, > 2 (n = 1, 2, . . .), it is easy to give a function N(x, n) so that for almost all x d,d, . . . d,, < f/(x, n) for all n > fro(x), but it seems hard to give a good estimation for a function H(n) so that for almost all x and n > n,, we have d,d, . . . d,, < H(n). It is not difficult to see that every x for which k 5x51 (ks 3 integer) can be written in the form (7. 6) with 2 rd,, s k+ 1, As a matter of fact, if t (x < & where 7' is an integer 2~ 1'~ k, then let US put d,(x)=+1 if r>2 or if .~=2 and +sx<~+&~ and d,(x)=2 if ;+&~xsI. Then putting ~,(x)==d~(x)x-1, we have always 1 ~SI(X)Zl\n\n; we define d2(x)===d,(r,(x)) and r?(x)=d,(x)r,(x)-1 and so on.\n\nThus we obtain the representation where 2 5 d,, (x) 5 k+ 1.\n\nA simple modification of the above argument shows that every x (0 <x < 1) can be written in the form As a matter of fact, if 1 1 sx<----1'\n\nV-1 where 11 z 2 is an integer, then two cases are possible : either JJ 5 3, then as shown above, x has a representation (7.8) with 2 5 d,, 54, for n = 1, 2, . . .; on the other hand if IT $ 3 then + < (21~-2)x--1~1 and thus x has the representation (7.8) with 2sd,,s4 (n=2,3, . ..) and d,=2zl-2. If we require in (7.6) d,, = 2 or d,, =3 for n = 1, 2, . . . it is easy to see that the measure of the set of those numbers for which such a representation exists, is 0.\n\nLet us consider namely all numbers of the form (7.5) where &= 2 or 3 (k=l, 2, . .). As for each x which has the representation (7.6) with d,, = 2 or 3 (n -1, 2, . . .) where d,, d,, . . ., d>-are fixed, is contained in an interval of length (26, . . .dJT)-', the set of all numbers x which have such a representation is covered by a set of intervals, the sum of length of which . Thus this set has the measure 0.\n\nIt would be interesting to determine the greatest value of Jj' such that for almost all x and any representation of x in the form (7.8) putting -D, -= d,d, . . . d,, we have lim dD,% 2 @. A modification of the above argument It-f co shows that there exists such a ,8 > 2 ; more exactly we shall show that we may take 13 z 2\"'13 . 3l 13. This can be shown as follows. The set of those numbers x, which have a representation of the form (7.8) where d,, . . ., L&I are fixed, is numbers x, and between where ccl, contained in an interval of the length 2 3d l...d,,l' Thus all those which have a representation of the above form such that dl -j the numbers u'~, . . ., dN+l not more than cNare different from 2, are covered by a set of intervals with total length Now it is easy to show (see e. g. [15], p. 405) that if 0 <p < 1, q = l-p and O-cecp, then\n\nThus it follows that for c = & Thus the set of those numbers x which have a representation (7. 8) in which putting D, = dId2. . . d,,, we have lim t& < 31'13212'13 has measure 0. ?I-+ m It follows that for almost all x lim fzz 2'2'133'13, which was to be proved. n-tm Now we construct an x (0 < x < 1) for which (7.9) where D,, ~2 is an integer, D,,/D plt~ and Dql+l 2 0: i. e. (7.9) is the Engel's series and at the same time the Sylvester's series of x and is such that for every k From this it will be easy to deduce that if is any other representation of x such that the S,t are integers, S,,+I 2 S,,, then S, SD?, infinitely often (we showed previously that this is not true for all x).\n\nWe construct the D,, inductively. Put D, = 2, let Da=kD1 be so large * that -&+ & is much less than every 2 d++ > & with a+ D, (,much less\" 1 means A+ $ < $ + $ 2 ; then choose D, = fD, so large that $ 4-k + $ 1 2 3 'I is much less than every a+d+$>A+& with a=jyDo, or b=/=DD,.\n\n1 2\n\nThis construction clearly gives an x with the required properties. Let (7.12) XZZ T-h-n=l IL be Sylvester's series of x and (7. 11) another representation of x. Is it true that for almost all x (7. 10) holds for infinitely many k? (Our construction gives only a set of measure 0 of such numbers x for which this is true.) Literature\n\nIt is clear from (1. 12) that M(q,J= + co."
