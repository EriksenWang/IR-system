    "abstract": "Mesozoic rocks of the Baja California Peninsula form one of the most areally extensive, best-exposed, longest-lived (160 my), least-tectonized and least-metamorphosed convergent-margin basin complexes in the world. This convergent margin shows an evolutionary trend that may be typical of arc systems facing large ocean basins: a progression from highly extensional (phase 1) through mildly extensional (phase 2) to compressional (phase 3) strain regimes. This trend is largely due to the progressively decreasing age of lithosphere that is subducted, which causes a gradual decrease in slab dip angle (and concomitant increase in coupling between lower and upper plates), as well as progressive inboard migration of the arc axis.\nThis paper emphasizes the usefulness of sedimentary and volcanic basin analysis for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of a convergent continental margin. Phase 1 consists of Late Triassic to Late Jurassic oceanic intra-arc to backarc basins that were isolated from continental sediment sources. New, progressively widening basins were created by arc rifting and sea floor spreading, and these were largely filled with progradational backarc arc-apron deposits that record the growth of adjacent volcanoes up to and above sea level. Inboard migration of the backarc spreading center ultimately results in renewed arc rifting, producing an influx of silicic pyroclastics to the backarc basin. Rifting succeeds in conversion of the active backarc basin into a remnant backarc basin, which is blanketed by epiclastic sands.\nPhase 1 oceanic arc -backarc terranes were amalgamated by Late Jurassic sinistral strike slip faults. They form the forearc substrate for phase 2, indicating inboard migration of the arc axis due to decrease in slab dip. Phase 2 consists of Early Cretaceous extensional fringing arc basins adjacent to a continent. Phase 2 forearc basins consist of grabens that stepped downward toward the trench, filled with coarse-grained slope apron deposits. Phase 2 intra-arc basins show a cycle of (1) arc extension, characterized by intermediate to silicic explosive and effusive volcanism, culminating in caldera-forming silicic ignimbrite eruptions, followed by (2) arc rifting, characterized by widespread dike swarms and extensive mafic lavas and hyaloclastites. This extensional-rifting cycle was followed by mid-Cretaceous backarc basin closure and thrusting of the fringing arc beneath the edge of the continent, caused by a decrease in slab dip as well as a possible increase in convergence rate.\nPhase 2 fringing arc terranes form the substrate for phase 3, which consists of a Late Cretaceous high-standing, compressional continental arc that migrated inboard with time. Strongly coupled subduction resulted in accretion of blueschist metamorphic rocks, with development of a broad residual forearc basin behind the growing accretionary wedge, and development of extensional forearc (trench -slope) basins atop the gravitationally collapsing accretionary wedge.

These rocks are well exposed in the Peninsular ranges of northern Baja California and in the Vizcaino Peninsula -Cedros Island region of western Baja California, whereas to the south and southeast, they are largely buried under volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Late Cenozoic Gulf Extensional Province. Mesozoic arc magmatism shifted inboard (toward the continent) with time (Fig. 1), from the Vizcaino-Cedros region (Late Triassic to Jurassic intra-oceanic, arc -ophiolite assemblages) to the western Peninsular Ranges (Early Cretaceous fring-ing oceanic arc) to the eastern Peninsular Ranges and adjacent mainland Mexico (Late Cretaceous continental arc).\n\nThis convergent margin shows an overall evolutionary trend that I suggest may be typical of arc systems facing large ocean basins: a progression from highly extensional through mildly extensional to compressional strain regimes (Fig. 2). In this evolutionary model, subduction is initiated by rapid sinking of very old, cold oceanic lithosphere, but over many tens of millions of years, the age of the lithosphere that reaches the trench and is subducted becomes progressively younger (Busby et al., 1998). This results in a gradual decrease in slab dip angle, causing an increase in coupling between the lower and upper plates, as well as progressive inboard Fig. 1. Tectonstratigraphic chart and locations of Mesozoic convergent-margin assemblages in Baja California, Mexico, grouped by evolutionary phases 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 2). Generalized geologic map of part of the Peninsular Ranges, of the Vizcaino Peninsula and of Cedros Island are presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. Phase 1-South Vizcaino Peninsula: La Costa ophiolite (LCO) and San Hipolito Formation (SH) (Whalen and Pessagno, 1984;Moore, 1985); volcaniclastic strata of Cerro El Calvario (CEC) (Moore, 1984(Moore, , 1985)). North Vizcaino Peninsula: Sierra San Andres ophiolite (SSO) and overlying Puerto Escondido tuff (PE) (Barnes, 1984;Moore, 1985); Eugenia Formation (E) (Hickey, 1984;Kimbrough et al., 1987). Cedros Island: Cedros Island ophiolite (CIO) and Choyal oceanic arc assemblage (C), overlapped by Gran Canon Formation backarc apron volcaniclastic rocks (GC) (Kimbrough, 1984(Kimbrough, , 1985;;Busby-Spera, 1987, 1988a,b;Critelli et al., 2002); Coloradito Formation (CF) (Kilmer, 1984;Boles and Landis, 1984); Eugenia Formation (EF) (Kilmer, 1984). Phase 2-Vizcaino Peninsula and Cedros Island: forearc strata, including Asuncion Formation (A) and lower Valle Group (VG) (Barnes, 1984;Moore, 1984Moore, , 1985;;Patterson, 1984;Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986;Smith et al., 1991;Smith and Busby, 1993). Western Belt Peninsular Ranges: Alisitos Group (AG) oceanic arc assemblage (Allison, 1955;Silver et al., 1963Silver et al., , 1979;;Gastil et al., 1975;Beggs, 1984;Gastil, 1985;Silver, 1986;Busby-Spera and White, 1987;White and Busby-Spera, 1987;Adams and Busby, 1994;Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998); associated backarc strata on continentalmargin substrate (Paleozoic -Mesozoic terranes of eastern belt of Peninsular Ranges) (Gastil, 1985;Griffith, 1987;Goetz et al., 1988;Goetz, 1989). Phase 3-Vizcaino Peninsula and Cedros Island: forearc strata, upper Valle Group (VG) (Barnes, 1984;Patterson, 1984;Morris et al., 1989;Smith and Busby, 1994), underthrust by blueschist-grade subduction complexes (Figs. 4 and 5;Sedlock, 1988;Smith et al., 1991;Sedlock et al., 1993). Western Peninsular Belt Ranges: forearc strata, Rosario Group (RG) (Kilmer, 1963;Gastil and Allison, 1966;Nilsen and Abbott, 1981;Bottjer and Link, 1984;Yeo, 1984;Boehlke and Abbott, 1986;Cunningham and Abbott, 1986;Morris andBusby-Spera, 1988, 1990;Morris et al., 1989;Filmer and Kirschvinck, 1989;Morris, 1992;Abbott et al., 1993;Fulford and Busby-Spera, 1993;Morris and Busby, 1996;Busby-Spera et al., 1988). Eastern Belt Peninsular Ranges: continental-arc plutons record an eastward-migrating linear locus of magmatism from ca. 100 to 75 Ma (Krummenacher et al., 1975;Silver, 1986;Silver and Chappal, 1988), with a major pulse of ''La Posta type'' plutons (Walawander et al., 1990) at about 98 Ma (Kimbrough et al., 2001); intrudes Paleozoic to Mesozoic continental margin terranes (Gastil and Miller, 1981;Gastil, 1985). migration of the arc axis. Subduction of old slabs causes trench rollback to be faster than trenchward migration of the upper plate, producing an extensional arc system, whereas compressional systems occur where an overiding plate advances trenchward faster than trench rollback, largely due to young age of the subducting slab (Dewey, 1980). Jarrard (1986), in an analysis of the dynamic controls on the tectonics of modern arc -trench systems, documented a strong positive correlation between the age of a subduction zone and the amount of compressional strain in the overriding plate. Dewey (1980) also predicted that convergent margins should grad-ually evolve from extensional to compressional. Our work in Baja California confirms this hypothesis, and provides more detailed conceptual models for  basin development along convergent margins facing large ocean basins.\n\nMost of the subduction zones in the world have been running for a long time, so there are few examples of early, extensional arc systems relative to later, neutral or compressional arc systems (Jarrard, 1986). For this reason, we need to study the geologic record to learn more about the growth of continents along convergent margins. I present a case study of a long-lived convergent margin, synthesizing published data and interpretations (Figs. 1 and 2; Busby et al., 1998) with new data (Figs. 3,4 and 5). I recognize three main tectonic phases in the Mesozoic evolution of Baja California. These are illustrated and described in Fig. 2, and include phase 1, highly extensional intraoceanic arc systems; phase 2, mildly extensional fringing-arc system; and phase 3, compressional continental -arc system. In my tectonic model, all of the elements that led to Mesozoic growth of the Mexican margin (except for oceanic rocks of the subduction Fig. 4. Generalized geologic map of the Vizcaino Peninsula and Cedros Island, showing the distribution of Mesozoic lithostratigraphic units depicted in Fig. 1 (Cedros Island, north Vizcaino and south Vizcaino). The oldest rocks are Late Triassic to Late Jurassic arc -ophiolite assemblages of phase 1 (Fig. 2; LCO, SH, SSO, PE, CIO, C, GC, E and CEC of Fig. 1). These subterranes were amalgamated and unconformably overlapped by Early Cretaceous forearc sedimentary rocks (Asuncion Formation (A) and lower Valle Group (VG) of Fig. 1), interpreted to represent the fill of extensional forearc basins formed during phase 2 (Figs. 2,11 and 12). These in turn are overlain by Late Cretaceous forearc sedimentary rocks of phase 3 (upper Valle Group (VG) of Fig. 1), and interpreted to represent the fill of extensional basins formed by gravitational collapse at the top of an overthickened accretionary wedge (Fig. 2), shown as subduction complexes on this map and on the map of Cedros Island (Fig. 5). complex) were formed and accreted in the upper plate of the margin.\n\nThe earliest stages of subduction in Baja California (ca. 220-130 Ma) are represented by intraoceanic arc -ophiolite systems of west-central Baja California (Fig. 1). Ophiolites include the Late Triassic Sierra de San Andres ophiolite in the northern Vizcaino peninsula (Moore, 1985;Sedlock, in press), the Late Triassic La Costa ophiolite in the southern Vizcaino Peninsula (Moore, 1985), and the Cedros Island ophiolite (Kimbrough, 1984). These are all interpreted to be suprasubduction zone ophiolites formed in forearc, intra-arc or backarc environments, because they have arc geochemical signatures (Moore, 1985;Kimbrough, 1984) and are directly overlain by arc volcanic -volcaniclastic rocks (Fig. 1). Early detachment faults are described from the Sierra de San Andres ophiolite (Sedlock, in press). Normal faults at the arc -ophiolite rift boundary on Cedros Island were reactivated in Late Cretaceous time, obscuring their primary features (Smith and Busby, 1993).\n\nVolcaniclastic cover on the Sierra de San Andres ophiolite is referred to as the Puerto Escondido tuff (Barnes, 1984); similar strata resting on the La Costa ophiolite (San Hipolito Formation) contain Late Triassic fossils (Whalen and Pessagno, 1984;Barnes, 1984;Moore, 1985). Volcaniclastic cover on the Fig. 5. Generalized geologic map of Cedros Island (for location, see Fig. 4). The oldest rocks consist of a rifted arc -ophiolite assemblage (Cedros Island ophiolite and arc basement, or CIO and C of Fig. 1). These are overlain by the Middle Jurassic Gran Canon Formation (GC of Fig. 1), interpreted as a progradational backarc apron that built southward from the rifted arc onto the spreading sea floor (Figs. 6 and 7). This in turn is overlain by sedimentary melange of the Coloradito Formation and arc volcaniclastic rocks of the Eugenia Formation (CF and EF, Fig. 1). Cretaceous forearc turbidites in the core of the Pinos syncline were deposited in normal-faulted basins during phase 3 (Figs. 2 and 15), contemporaneous with unroofing of bluechists along detachment faults at deeper structural levels (Sedlock, 1988;Smith et al., 1991).\n\nCedros Island ophiolite, referred to as the Gran Canon Formation (Kilmer, 1977(Kilmer, , 1984;;Kimbrough, 1984Kimbrough, , 1985;;Busby-Spera, 1987, 1988a,b;Critelli et al., 2002), also overlaps rifted arc basement of the Choyal Formation, all of Late Middle Jurassic age (Fig. 1). The Gran Canon Formation is locally hydrothermally altered at its basal contact with the ophiolite indicating deposition on hot ocean floor (Busby-Spera, 1988a). I interpret the volcaniclastic cover of these ophiolites to represent arc aprons, consisting of pyroclastic and lesser epiclastic detritus deposited in small, steepsided intra-arc and backarc basins.\n\nThe Gran Canon Formation on Cedros Island (Figs. 5-9a) offers what is arguably the least deformed, best-exposed outcrop view of a backarc apron studied to date (Marsaglia, 1995); therefore, its distinctive stratigraphy can be used to identify dismembered or poorly exposed backarc aprons elsewhere in the geologic record. The Gran Canon Formation is of further interest because it affords a more proximal Fig. 6. Representative measured sections through proximal and distal parts of the Gran Canon Formation, modified from Busby-Spera (1988a,b) (localities in Fig. 5). Paleocurrent data indicate a northern source, and pyroclastic debris thickens from south to north in the outcrop areas across present-day Cedros Island (Fig. 5). view of a backarc apron than is available from most of the drill sites in the western Pacific, and this proximal view provides more detailed information on the volcanic and tectonic evolution of an intra-oceanic arc during backarc basin formation (Critelli et al., 2002). For these reasons, I present a summary of the stratigraphic evolution of the Gran Canon Formation, which shows a simple, uniform sedimentation pattern that may be typical of backarc basins isolated from terrigenous sediment influx (Busby-Spera, 1988a;Critelli et al., 2002;Figs. 6  and 7).\n\nA rifted arc and ophiolte assemblage and overlying volcaniclastic rocks, all of late Middle Jurassic age, represent the arc side of a backarc basin on presentday Cedros Island (Kimbrough, 1984;Figs. 5 -8). Backarc ophiolite generation was immediately followed by progradation of a deepwater pyroclastic apron into the backarc basin across rifted arc onto oceanic crust in a progressively widening backarc basin. Busby-Spera (1988a,b) divided this pyroclastic apron into tuff, lapilli tuff -tuff breccia, and primary volcanic lithofacies (Figs. 6 and 7). Pyroclastic tex-Fig. 7. Intraoceanic backarc-apron deposits typical of Phase 1, using the Gran Canon Formation on Cedros Island (Fig. 5) as an example. This drawing shows the backarc basin at the time of maximum progradation of the pyroclastic backarc apron, during renewed arc rifting (stage IV, Fig. 8).   -8). (a) Excellent exposure allow tracing of beds only a meter or two thick for distances of 10 km or more. (b) Early bimodal volcanism during the nascent arc -backarc phase produces mafic tuffs (brown) and lesser silicic tuffs (white) of the tuff lithofacies (Fig. 6). Rifted arc basement forms far ridge, visible on upper right. (c) Fine-grained, thin-bedded tuffs and minor porcellanites (tuff lithofacies) deposited from very dilute sediment gravity flows fed by deepwater eruptions. (d) Lapilli tuff -tuff breccia lithofacies, with medium-to very thick beds of lapilli tuff and tuff breccia (left) overlying tuff lithofacies (right); section viewed is 10 m thick. (e) Closeup of tuff breccia in proximal deepwater apron (hammer for scale), dominated by massive, unsorted, ungraded monolithic debris flow deposits. (f) Pillow lavas of the primary volcanic lithofacies (Fig. 6), erupted from fissures on the backarc apron produced by renewed arc rifting (author for scale). These yield excellent paleoslope data. (g) Pillow breccia of the primary volcanic lithofacies, with pie-shaped slices through chilled rinds to pillow interiors. Field boot for scale. (h) Dacitic subaqueous pyroclastic flow deposit of the primary volcanic lithofacies, with abundant pumices (brown) as well as copper sulfide altered dacite volcanic rock fragments (blue).\n\ntures in this apron reflect the growth of the source arc terrane from a deeply submerged chain with limited production and dispersal of ash, to a shallow-marine edifice producing hyaloclastic and scoriaceous debris, to an emergent arc erupting pumiceous differentiated magmas (Figs. 6 and 9).\n\nThe tuff lithofacies records deposition from dilute sediment gravity flows generated by hydrostatically suppressed eruptions at a deeply submerged, nascent arc (Fig. 8, stage II). It consists of thin-bedded, wellsorted, laterally continuous tuffs that thicken into paleo-lows, indicating deposition from dilute sediment gravity flows. Its bimodal composition (Fig. 9b,c) is typical of magmatism in early rift and seafloor spreading phases, and a high ratio of unaltered green hornblende to total hornblende indicates a syneruptive, pyroclastic source (Critelli et al., 2002). It contains platy shards instead of bubble wall shards, suggestive of deepwater eruptions. The lapilli tufftuff breccia lithofacies, in contrast, shows an upsection increase in scorea fragments of explosive magmatic origin, recording a decrease in hydrostatic pressure as the summit of the volcanic source grew closer to sea level (Fig. 8, stage III). It consists of medium-to very thick-bedded lapilli tuffs and tuff breccias (Fig. 9d), deposited from debris flows on proximal parts of the apron (Fig. 9e) and from highdensity turbidity currents that deposited graded megabeds on distal parts of the apron (Fig. 6). Rapid buildup of coarse detritus on proximal parts of the Gran Canon backarc apron resulted in development of numerous slumped horizons (Fig. 6). The primary volcanic lithofacies consists of basalt lava flows fed from fissures that extended down the backarc apron (Figs. 6, 7 and 9f), as well as monolithologic dacitic subaqueous pyroclastic flow deposits (Figs. 6 and 9h). Basalt lavas have the largest pillows (Fig. 9f) in proximal parts of the apron, and show a down-apron increase in pillow breccia (Fig. 9g), interpreted to represent flow-foot rubble that cascaded down the apron from flow fronts at upslope positions (Busby-Spera, 1987). The dacite pyroclastic flow deposits (Fig. 9h) form graded megabeds tens of meters thick (Fig. 6), inferred to be fed by caldera-forming explosive eruptions at the climax of renewed arc rifiting (Fig. 8, stage IV). Recent work in the Izu Bonin and Kurile arcs has shown that arc rifting produces silicic calderas (Gill et al., 1992;Iizasa et al., 1999;Fiske et al., 1995Fiske et al., , 2001) ) where dacite pyroclastic debris dominates the stratigraphic record of the backarc basin (Nishimura et al., 1991(Nishimura et al., , 1992)). This second rifting event resulted in conversion of the active backarc basin into a remnant backarc basin (Fig. 8, stage V). Such an event typically occurs within 10 -15 my after the birth of a backarc basin (Karig, 1983). The uppermost lithofacies, the epiclastic lithofacies (Fig. 6), is a fine-grained epiclastic sandstone that draped the backarc apron after rifting isolated it from the active arc (Fig. 8).\n\nThe phase 2 forearc basin forms an overlap assemblage upon amalgamated arc -ophiolite terranes of phase 1 (Figs. 1 and 2), indicating that they were amalgamated in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time. The presence of continental-margin-derived slide sheets in the Late Jurassic Coloradito Formation, which overlies the Gran Canon Formation on Cedros Island (Boles and Landis, 1984), as well as granitic clasts with a strong inherited component of Precambrian lead in Early Cretaceous strata of the northern Vizcaino Peninsula (Kimbrough et al., 1987) indicates juxtaposition with a continent or continental fragment. This docking must have been gentle, however, because evidence for shortening in phase 1 terranes is generally lacking, except in the Sierra de San Andres ophiolite, and even there thrust faults and folds are not widely or penetratively developed (Sedlock, in press). Instead, distribution of key units there suggests sinistral slip in Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous time, coeval with extension (Sedlock, in press). I suggest that terrane amalgamation was accomplished by sinistral transtension in the upper plate of the arc -trench system, with a possible local restraining bend causing minor shortening in the Sierra de San Andres ophiolite (discussed further below). A decrease in slab dip during ongoing subduction then resulted in establishment of a new fringing arc inboard of the arc -ophiolite terranes, in the present-day position of the western Peninsular Ranges (Figs. 1 and 3).\n\nThe Mesozoic geology of the Peninsular Ranges spans phases two and three of this paper (Fig. 1).\n\nWe have proposed that in the second phase of subduction (Early Cretaceous time, ca. 140-100 Ma), an extensional volcanoplutonic arc developed in the present-day western Peninsular Ranges of Baja California (Alisitos Group, Fig. 1), and an extensional forearc basin complex developed outboard of it in the present-day Vizcaino Peninsula (Asuncion Formation and Lower Valle Group, Fig. 1). In our model, the Alisitos Group represents a fringing arc that lay near the edge of the continental margin, separated from it by a backarc basin that received both continental-and arc-derived sediment (Fig. 2).\n\nIn the third phase of subduction (Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene time, ca. 100-50 Ma), a highstanding continental arc was established in the present-day eastern Peninsular Ranges (Busby et al., 1998;Figs. 1 and 2). Although the third phase was part of a gradual trend toward progressively more compressional stress, this trend accelerated in mid-Cretaceous time (ca. 105-95 Ma), perhaps due to an increase in plate convergence rate (Engebretson et al., 1985). We have proposed that this increased rate of convergence collapsed the fringing arc against the continent and caused reverse faulting and uplift (Busby et al., 1998;Figs. 1  and 2). In our model, the boundary between the western and eastern Peninsular Ranges represents the site of backarc basin closure.\n\nIn this section, I summarize previous work on the geology of the Peninsular Ranges batholith in Baja California, and discuss alternative models for the origin of the western and eastern belts, and the boundary between them. This is important to do because five different models have been published over the past 3 years, and ideas are evolving quickly (Busby et al., 1998;Johnson et al., 1999;Dickinson and Lawton, 2001;Wetmore et al., 2002;Umhoefer, in press).\n\nThree fourths of the Peninsular Ranges batholith lies south of the international border, and although it is much less well studied than rocks north of the border, existing data strongly suggest that the major lithologic belts and structural features persist for the length of the batholith (Todd et al., 1988;Lovera et al., 1997).\n\nThe 800-km-long batholith is divided axially into a western gabbro to monzogranite belt, and an eastern granodiorite -granite belt (Silver et al., 1979;Silver and Chappal, 1988;Walawander et al., 1990). Plutons of the western belt yield U -Pb zircon ages of 140 to 105 my, with no systematic geographic distribution (''static arc''), whereas plutons of the eastern belt record an eastward-migrating linear locus of magmatism from 105 to 80 my (''migrating arc'' of Silver, 1986). The boundary between the western and eastern batholithic belts coincides with a step in d 18 O values (Taylor and Silver, 1978) and rare earth element abundances (Gromet and Silver, 1979), interpreted as the western margin of major continental crustal contribution to the batholith. This boundary also approximately coincides with a ''remarkably regular contact, defined by gravity and magnetic data in southern California and northernmost Baja that dips about 45j to the east and extends to a minimum depth of 10 -15 km'' (Todd et al., 1988). This boundary also coincides with west-vergent high-angle thrusts that place high-grade eastern belt metamorphic rocks over lower-grade western belt metamorphic (shown on phase 3 in Fig. 2). These ductile, west-vergent high-angle thrusts have been documented in California (Cuyamaca -Laguna Mountains shear zone of Todd et al., 1988), in northern Baja California in the Sierra San Pedro Martir (Johnson et al., 1999) and as far south as the latitude of El Rosario (Fig. 3; Griffith, 1987;Goetz et al., 1988;Goetz, 1989). These workers report dates from deformed plutons that range in age from about 115 to 105 Ma, and dates on undeformed, cross-cutting plutons range that from 98 to 90 Ma.\n\nEarly publications interpreted the western Peninsular Ranges as an exotic oceanic arc terrane that was accreted to continental-margin rocks of the eastern Peninsular Ranges in mid-Cretaceous time (Gastil et al., 1978). Most workers since then have considered this boundary to be a suture between North America and a fringing arc that was originally separated from North America by a backarc basin (Fig. 3, Phase 2; Gastil et al., 1978,;Gastil and Miller, 1981;Rangin, 1978;Phillips, 1993;Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992;Thomson and Girty, 1994;Busby et al., 1998). The presence of the Julian Schist/Bedford Canyon Formation on either side of this boundary (interpreted as Jurassic forearc turbidites) supports the fringing arc (Fig. 2) rather than exotic arc interpretation (Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992). Mapping both north and south of the border has shown that the western belt Santiago Peak Volcanics overlies these turbidites in depositional contact (Kimbrough and Herzig, 1994;Sutherland et al., 2002).\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the boundary between the western and eastern Peninsular Ranges, published by Dickinson and Lawton (2001), is that:\n\n(1) this zone of deformation marks the site of closure of a large ocean basin, not a backarc basin, (2) this closure occurred before (not after) development of the Alisitos arc terrane, and (3) the Alisitos arc is a post-accretion continental margin arc. However, almost all of the evidence given for Dickinson and Lawton's hypothesis is taken from mainland Mexico where exposure is poor, rather than from Baja California, where exposure is excellent. The existing data from Baja California show that the age of the ''suture'' is younger (not older) than the Alisitos arc, and the geochemistry of the Alisitos arc precludes an origin as a continental margin arc. Furthermore, the ''suture'' lacks the accretionary wedge and forearc strata one would expect if it recorded closure of a major ocean basin (see models for remnant ocean basins published by Graham et al., 1975;Ingersoll, 1995). Last, Triassic to Jurassic continental margin arc rocks of southwestern North America (Busby-Spera, 1988a,b) and Permian to Cretaceous continental arc rocks of western South America (Burke, personal communication, 1988) show evidence for protracted extension and subsidence. Although there is no ocean floor record for most of the Mesozoic, I interpret this protracted and widespread extensional continental arc tectonic regime to record trench rollback during subduction of an old, cold and very large paleo-Pacific oceanic plate following the breakup of Pangaea. Subduction of the young, warm shrinking ocean basin shown by Dickinson and Lawton (2001) should have produced arc uplift and shortening (Jarrard, 1986).\n\nAnother alternative interpretation of the boundary between the western and eastern Peninsular Ranges, published by Johnson et al. (1999), is a twosubduction-zone model, in which the Early Creta-ceous Alisitos oceanic arc originated above an eastdipping subduction zone outboard of another eastdipping subduction zone beneath a coeval hypothesized continental margin arc; in this model, subduction along the inboard continental arc drove convergence and ''non-terminal suturing'' of the two arcs by about 105 Ma. The SHRIMP U -Pb zircon evidence for the hypothesized coeval continental arc magmatism is, however, preliminary (Johnson et al., 1999), and the possibility remains that it is older or younger than the Alisitos arc, permitting the backarc basin closure model to remain an option (Fig. 3, Phases 2 -3). We see no sedimentological evidence for uplift of the Peninsular Ranges in the forearc sedimentology before about 100 Ma (discussed below); therefore, we suggest that major uplift did not occur until the backarc basin closed completely, although the closure process may have begun along some segments of the arc by 115 Ma.\n\nA third alternative interpretation of the boundary between the western and eastern Peninsular Ranges, published by Wetmore et al. (2002), is that western Peninsular Ranges rocks north of the present-day Agua Blanca fault zone of Fig. 3 (Santiago Peak Volcanics) represent an oceanic arc that fringed North America, whereas rocks south of the fault (Alisitos group) represent an exotic arc. Along-strike variations are common in modern volcanoplutonic arcs, however; a higher proportion of marine strata in the Alisitos arc (relative to the Santiago Peak volcanics) could reflect greater amounts of extension and subsidence in that segment of the convergent margin, and in any event, the proportion of nonmarine rocks in the Alisitos arc is substantial (Allison, 1955;Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998;Busby et al., 2003). The suggestion that the Santiago Peak Volcanics contain welded tuffs while the Alisitos ignimbrites are poorly welded (Wetmore et al., 2002) does not take into account the large volumes of welded and ultrawelded tuff mapped in the Alisitos arc (Beggs, 1984;Fackler Adams, 1997;Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998;Busby et al., 2003). The interpretation that zircon inheritance occurs in the Santiago Peak volcanics but not in the Alisitos arc (Wetmore et al., 2002) is based on an extremely limited published data set for the Alisitos arc, which in fact does show evidence of inheri-tence (Busby et al., 2003); similarly, the suggestion that the ages of the two arcs are different is based on a handful of published U -Pb zircon dates for the Alisitos arc. Last but not least, the exotic arc model for the Alisitos arc is that it requires removal of a significant proportion of intervening (North American) forearc basin and subduction complex turbidites, perhaps by subduction (Wetmore et al., 2002). I continue to prefer the simpler model that the Alisitos arc fringed North America (Fig. 2, Phase 2).\n\nDeep marine strata inboard of the Alisitos arc have interfingering arc-derived and continent-derived Fig. 12. Reconstruction of the phase 2 extensional forearc basin complex (Asuncion Formation of south Vizcaino Peninsula, Fig. 1). Fig. 11. Reconstruction of the arc to forearc region during Phase 2. Syndepositional normal faults drop basins to bathyal water depths both within the fringing oceanic arc (Fig. 10) and in the forearc region (Fig. 12). There is no evidence for an accretionary wedge at this time; instead, basement rocks (oceanic arc -ophiolite terranes of phase 1, Fig. 12) form horsts and grabens that downstep to the trench (Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986).\n\nsedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks, indicating that the Alisitos arc represents a fringing arc separated from the continent by a narrow backarc basin, (Phillips, 1993). The inboard position of the arc axis relative to phase 1, the inferred narrowness of the backarc basin, and the lack of backarc ophiolite remnants, all suggest that extension was more moderate in phase 2 (relative to phase 1), probably due to a lower angle of subduction.\n\nIn this section, we present evidence that the Baja California convergent margin was at least mildly extensional in Early Cretaceous time, with wellpreserved syndepositional normal faults and high rates of subsidence in both the arc region (Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998) and the forearc region (Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986). There is no evidence for an accretionary wedge at this time (Sedlock, 1988(Sedlock, , 1993(Sedlock, , 1996)); instead normally faulted crystalline basement extended all the way to the trench (Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986; Figs. 2 and 4). Although backarc and intra-arc extension are widely recognized processes, forearc extension is less well understood, even though it has been identified along many convergent margins, both modern and ancient (Moberly et al., 1982;Flint and Turner, 1988;Flinch and Bally, 1992;Wessel et al., 1994;Imperato, 1996). About 45% of modern convergent margins are nonaccretionary (Ingersoll and Busby, 1995), and forearc extension was probably even more common in the geologic past, when there were more young subduction zones in existence. Extension of the arc and forearc created deep basins stuffed with volcaniclastic rocks; these added to the growth of the continental margin, so distinctive features of them are described here.\n\nThe Alisitos arc is an approximately 300 Â 30-km oceanic arc terrane that lies in the western wall of the Peninsular Ranges batholith south of the modern Agua Blanca fault zone (Fig. 3). We have completed detailed mapping and dating of a 50 Â 30-km Rosario segment of the Alisitos arc terrane (Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998;Figs. 2 and 10), as well as reconnaissance mapping in the 50 Â 30-km San Quentin segment to the north (Busby et al., 2003). The size, unusually good exposure (Fig. 13a), and excellent preservation (Fig. 13b) of the fringing-arc terrane permits comparison of its stratigraphy and structure with those of modern fringing-arc systems.\n\nThe El Rosario segment of the Alisitos arc forms a west-dipping monoclinal section approximately 4000 m thick, intruded by contemporaneous hypabyssal and plutonic rocks (Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998; Fig. 10). The El Rosario segment of the Alisitos arc was subaerial around its main eruptive center, and was flanked by marine basins to the present-day north and south (Figs. 10 and 13a,c). The southern marine basin is a ''volcano-bounded basin'' (as defined by Smith and Landis, 1995), where strata accumulated in the low areas between constructive volcanic centers, in shallow water to deepwater environments (Fig. 13a,b). The northern marine basin, in contrast, is a ''fault-bounded basin'', which was downthrown into deep water relative to the main subaerial eruptive center along a steeply dipping fault zone (Fig. 10A).\n\nSeveral characteristics of the Alisitos arc may be used to distinguish volcano-bounded-and faultbounded-intra-arc basins in other settings. The rugged In the foreground are students examining a subaqueous pyroclastic flow deposit (white, with crude stratification); on the far ridge are marine mudstones and sandstones, overlain by a resistant rudist reef (at ridge crest). (b) Metamorphic grade and deformational structures increase eastward within the Alisitos arc terrane, but most of it is wellpreserved enough to display delicate primary sedimentary structures, such as this sea star resting trace. (c) Soft sediment folding produced by fluidizarion of wet substrate where hot pyroclastic flows entered the sea. (d) Lineations in the tuff of Aguajito, a dacitic welded tuff whose eruption formed the La Burra caldera (Fig. 10A). Lineations in welded tuffs form from stretching of pumices in ignimbrites deposited at very high temperatures (ultrawelded or ''lava like'' ignimbrites). (e) Peperite, defined as interaction of magma and wet sediment. This peperite formed where very hot ignimbrite slabs avalanched into a deep marine basin, along with wet volcaniclastic debris. The margins of the hot ignimbrite blocks interacted explosively with the wet volcaniclastic host in the avalanche deposit, causing wide zones of complex mixing to occur, in both fluidal and brittle states. (f) Subaerial dacite lava dome breccia deposits, formed of tightly packed monlithic dacite blocks in nonsorted, nonstartified deposits tens to hundreds of meters thick. (g) Relatively well-rounded, well-sorted polylithic volcanic cobble to boulder conglomerate on the subaerial edifice. Rounding is rare, due to very short transport distances and residence times in fluvial or shallow-marine environments.\n\ndown-faulted flank of the edifice produced mass wasting, plumbed large-volume eruptions to the surface, and caused pyroclastic flows to disintegrate into turbulent suspensions that mixed completely with water. In contrast, gentler slopes on the opposite flank allowed pyroclastic flows to enter the sea with integ-rity, and supported extensive buildups of bioherms (Fackler Adams and Busby, 1998;Busby et al., in press). Rare beach conglomerates (Fig. 13g) are also restricted to the volcano-bounded basin. Slumping and other mass wasting events were rare and small in scale in the volcano-bounded basin relative to the fault-bounded basin, where topography was steeper and seismicity more common.\n\nWe recognize two evolutionary stages in the El Rosario-San Quentin (100 km long) segment of the Alisitos arc terrane: (I) extensional oceanic arc, characterized by intermediate to silicic explosive and effusive volcanism, culminating in caldera-forming silicic ignimbrite eruptions at the onset of arc rifting, and (II) rifted oceanic arc, characterized by mafic effusive and hydroclastic rocks and abundant dike swarms. New U -Pb zircon data from the volcanic and plutonic rocks of both phases indicate that the entire 4000-m-thick section accumulated in about 1.5 Ma, at 111-110 Ma (Busby et al., 2003). Two types of units are widespread enough to permit tentative stratigraphic correlation across much of this 100-km-long segment of the arc: a welded dacite ignimbrite erupted from La Burra caldera, and a deepwater debrisavalanche deposit, both shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10A is a reconstructed cross-section of part of the Alisitos arc, in a time frame interpreted to represent an extensional oceanic arc. As discussed above, incipient rifting of an oceanic arc and the resultant change in stress regime produce silicic calderas (Taylor et al., 1990;Gill et al., 1992;Clift, 1995;Arculus et al., 1995). Caldera collapse on the central emergent edifice ponded welded dacite ignimbrite to a thickness of at least 3 km (La Burra caldera, Fig. 10A). The subaerial outflow facies is up to 300 m thick, and densely welded even where only a few meters thick (Fig. 13d). Outflow ignimbrite traversed a dacite dome complex to the south (Fig. 13f), and entered the volcano-bounded marine basin to the south, where it is not welded, but nonetheless shows evidence of heat retention in some flow units (Fig. 13c; Fackler Adams, 1997). In the northern fault-bounded basin, the tuff of Aguajito occurs as blocks, as much as 150 m across, emplaced as part of a debris -avalanche deposit shed into deep water from the faulted basin margin (Fig. 10A). These blocks were hot enough to deform plastically, and to form peperite with the debris -avalanche matrix (Fig. 13e). Fig. 10B is a reconstructed cross-section of part of the Alisitos arc, in a time frame interpreted to represent arc rifting. This is marked by outpouring of basalt lava flows and contemporaneous emplacement of dike swarms that both cross cut and pass upward into sills and lava flows (Fackler Adams, 1997). The sharp contact between stage 1 and stage 2 strata, and the overwhelming predominance of lavas over fluvial or marine volcaniclastic rocks, indicates that the onset of rift basalt volcanism was abrupt and voluminous. As a result, the central edifice was transformed from a subaerial stratovolcano with a summit caldera, to a basalt lava plateau fringed by small basaltic cones (Fig. 10B).\n\nIn summary, evidence for arc extension and rifting includes syndepositional normal faults, very high subsidence rates, debris avalanche deposits, and silicic calderas, culminating in widespread basalt volcanism.\n\nEvidence for extension in the forearc region during phase two includes syndepositional normal faults, with fault scarps fringed by coarse-grained slope apron deposits (Figs. 2, Phase 2, 11 and 12; Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986). The slope apron deposits are thick, laterally extensive wedges that built outward from coastal normal fault scarps onto graben floors at bathyal water depths (Fig. 12). Time frame I, shown on the right side of Fig. 12, illustrates the peak of extension. Rock-fall avalanches produced talus aprons (Fig. 14a) that pass basinward into debris flow aprons (Fig. 14b), where retogressive failures produced highdensity turbidity currents (Fig. 14c). Time frame II, shown on the left side of Fig. 12, illustrates waning extension, when the eroded horst block provided sand to a fine-grained turbidite wedge. These thin-bedded bathyal marine sandstones are dominated by Bouma C division cross lamination (Fig. 14d) and convolute lamination, suggesting deposition from low-density turbidity currents flowing down steeply sloping aprons.\n\nThe forearc grabens must have stepped downward toward the trench, because arc-derived detritus was able to make its way into each sub-basin, and paleocurrent directions are consistently toward the west (Fig. 11; Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986). This is also a characteristic of modern extensional forearcs, such as Peru (Moberly et al., 1982) the Marianas (Wessel et al., 1994) and north Chile (Buddin et al., 1993).\n\nPhase two ended when the Alisitos arc was thrust beneath Pleozoic -Mesozoic continental margin terranes of the present day eastern Peninsular Ranges along high-angle reverse faults (see phase three, Fig. 2). As discussed above, the paleotectonic setting remains controversial, but I interpret this event to record backarc basin closure as the angle of subduction shallowed (Fig. 2), augmented by an increase in convergence rate proposed for that time by Engebretson et al. (1985).\n\nIn the third phase of subduction (Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene time, ca. 100 -50 Ma), a highstanding continental arc was established in the present-day eastern Peninsular Ranges (Fig. 2, Phase 3). All workers are in agreement on this, although proposed uplift mechanisms vary.\n\nEvidence for arc uplift includes (1) the presence of ca. 105-95 Ma reverse faults within the arc (Griffith, 1987;Todd et al., 1988;Goetz et al., 1988;Goetz, 1989;George and Dokka, 1994;Thomson and Girty, 1994), and (2) the coeval sudden influx into forearc basins of coarse-grained sediment eroded from relatively deep structural levels of the arc (Barnes, 1984;Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986;Kimbrough et al., 2001). Lovera et al. (1997) used detrital K-feldspar in Peninsular Ranges forearc basins north of the border to infer very high mean denudation rates for ca. 100 Ma plutons (about 1 km/Ma). George and Dokka (1994) attributed the cooling of 94 -93 Ma plutons in the northern Peninsular Ranges batholith to 10-14 km of exhumation along the Santa Rosa mylonite, in only 2 or 3 million years. They attribute this extremely high rate to east-directed extension, at rates of 5-7 km/Ma (also see Erskine and Wenk, 1985;Gastil et al., 1992). George and Dokka (1994) infer that this extension resulted from failure of an unstable crustal welt that formed at 99-94 Ma, by west-vergent thrusting and crustal thickening of 10 -18 km (also see Engel and Schultejann, 1984;Todd et al., 1988;Goodwin and Renne, 1991;Grove, 1993). Alternatively, Kimbrough et al. (2001) used detrital zircon from forearc strata of the Vizcaino -Cedros region to infer that this uplift event was triggered by the emplacement of a batholith (La Posta pluton intrusions) at about 96 Ma. Emplacement of tonalite on this scale, however, requires a previously thickened crust (Kimbrough et al., 2001); therefore, I argue that this magmatism occurred in response to the same increased plate convergence rate that caused shortening, crustal thickening and tectonic uplift.\n\nIntra-arc basins from phase three are not preserved, due to arc uplift and erosional and tectonic denudation, but forearc basins provide a record of arc unroofing. Forearc basins also provide evidence for a compressional strain regime throughout the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, with a dextral strike slip component in the late Late Cretaceous. For these reasons, the forearc basins are described in this section.\n\nStrongly coupled subduction along the Late Cretaceous compressional arc (Fig. 2C) resulted in accretion of blueschist metamorphic rocks (Sedlock, 1988), and development of a Cenomanian to Campanian residual forearc basin behind the growing accretionary wedge (Vizcaino Peninsula, Figs. 1 and 4). Collapse of the overthickened accretionary wedge resulted in development of detachment faults at depth (Sedlock, 1993(Sedlock, , 1996)); these pass upward into high-angle normal faults bounding Cenomanian to Coniacian forearc extensional basins at the surface of the wedge (Figs. 15 and 16;Smith and Busby, 1993).\n\nA rapid transition from a mildly extensional arc to a strongly compressional arc is recorded in mid-Cretaceous strata that occur in outboard parts of the forearc basin complex (Valle Group of Vizcaino -Cedros region, Fig. 1). Gravelly sediment gravity flows with boulders up to 1 m in diameter flooded the entire region, depositing a conglomerate sheet 150 -200 m thick overlain by a 2 -3-km thick section of sandstone and conglomerate (Fig. 16a,b). Clast compositions show a dramatic change, from an undissected oceanic arc provenance to a deeply dissected continental arc provenance (Busby-Spera and Boles, 1986).\n\nConglomerates of the Valle Group on Cedros Island fill a deep-marine half-graben structure that formed by reactivation of a Jurassic fault between rifted arc and ophiolite basement of phase 1 (Smith and Busby, 1993;Fig. 8). The axis of the half-graben acted as a submarine canyon that funneled sediment gravity flows from the arc source toward the presentday southwest, while locally derived megablocks fell from the fault scarps (Fig. 16c,d). Meanwhile, the shoulder of the half graben was draped by sandy turbidity currents that ramped up and back down the graben shoulder (Fig. 15). Propagation of a second normal fault into the area (Coloradito fault) resulted in development of a transfer zone ramp, which shed siltstone -mudstone blocks off of the horst block shown in stage I, into the enlarged basin of stage II (intraformational olistostrome, Figs. 15 and 16e). Ongoing faulting and seismicity resulted in oversteepened and unstable slopes that generated numerous submarine landslide scars (Fig. 16f), producing apron deposits of chaotic mudstone -sandstone (Fig. 15) and soft-sediment folds (Fig. 16g). As the basin filled, turbidite channels (Fig. 16h) were no longer confined to the master fault-proximal end of the basin. Note that subsidiary normal faults occur across the width of the basin, but these are not shown in the reconstruction (Fig. 15) for simplicity's sake.\n\nThe near coincidence of peak blueschist metamorphism in the lower plate of the convergent margin (Baldwin and Harrison, 1989) with the onset of normal faulting in the upper plate (Smith and Busby, 1993) supports blueschist unroofing models calling for tectonic denudation soon after peak metamorphism, due to gravitational collapse at the top of the overthickened (compressional) accretionary wedge (e.g. Platte, 1986;Jayko et al., 1987). It is important to recognize that trench-slope basins may form by upper crustal extension on top of a shortening accretionary wedge in an arc system that is regionally compressional.\n\nArc magmatism gradually migrated eastward (inboard) within the eastern Peninsular Ranges during Late Cretaceous time (Silver, 1986), so that by Campanian time (or perhaps Turonian time), the Early Cretaceous arc basement of phase 2 became the substrate for the Peninsular Ranges forearc basin complex (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). In this section, I present stratigraphic and structural evidence that this forearc basin complex formed as dextral strike slip basins in response to oblique convergence (Busby et al., 1998) proposed for this time frame by plate reconstruction models of Engebretson et al. (1985) and Glazner (1991). Forearc strike slip basins in Baja California provide further evidence for the compressional nature of the Late Cretacous arc (phase 3, Fig. 2), since coupling is the primary factor controlling the devel-opment of strike slip faults in the upper plates of convergent margins (Jarrard, 1986).\n\nThe Rosario embayment (Figs. 1 and 17) is by far the most areally extensive, least deformed or altered, and best-exposed forearc basin segment of the Peninsular Ranges. Our studies demonstrate several lines of evidence for a strike-slip origin of the Peninsular Ranges forearc basin complex (Morris andBusby-Spera, 1988, 1990;Morris et al., 1989;Morris, 1992;Morris and Busby, 1996). Rapid vertical alternation of nonmarine and bathyal marine strata indicates alternating uplift and downdropping of the basin (''porpois-Fig. 15. Reconstruction of a deep-water extensional forearc basin that formed atop an accretionary wedge during Phase 3 (Fig. 2) on Cedros Island (Fig. 5).\n\ning'', Fig. 17). Very high rates of tectonic subsidence and sedimentation are documented for the formation we have dated best, using single crystal 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates on tuffs (Renne et al., 1991). In our mapping of the Rosario embayment, we have recognized a distinctive structural style used to identify strike slip basins. This style consists of faults with reverse-slip separation and normal-slip separation that develop simultaneously with grabens and arches, in positions that vary rapidly through time (Crowell, 1982;Wood et al., 1994;Nilsen and Sylvester, 1995;Barnes and Audru, 1999;Barnes et al., 2001). Rapid alternation of contractional and extensional events is a hallmark of modern strike-slip forearc basins (Kimura, 1986;Geist et al., 1988).\n\nIn fewer than 5 my (early Campanian), basal nonmarine strata (Bocana Roja Formation, Fig. 17B) were folded and cut by high-angle reverse faults, dropped to bathyal depths along basin-bounding faults (Punta Baja Formation), and then uplifted above sea level and weakly folded again during renewed reverse-slip separation along intrabasinal faults (Escarpa Member of the El Gallo Formation). In late Campanian time, a series of westward-downstepping half-grabens formed along the eastern margin of the forearc basin (Fig. 17A), along faults with slickensides that show a rightslip component of displacement. The eastern basin margin fault zone was first recognized by Gastil and Allison (1966). Transverse alluvial fan -fluvial systems (Castillo and Disecado Members of the El Gallo Formation, Fig. 17) were established whose deposits indicate very rapid subsidence rates of 600 m/my (Renne et al., 1991;Fulford and Busby-Spera, 1993), consistent with deposition in a strike slip basin. Shortly before the Campanian -Maastrichtian boundary, the basin was tilted westward so that the eastern margin was uplifted to subaerial environments, passing rapidly westward (basinward) to bathyal depths (Figs. 18 and 19). This tilting resulted in valley incision along the eastern margin, and marine transgression in the western part of the basin (Rosario Formation lower sequence, Fig. 17). Finally, contraction of the forearc basin in Paleocene time resulted in development of a broad syncline along the axis of the basin, causing incision of the basin margin and resedimentation of conglomerates into the basin axis on coarse-grained subaqueous deltas (Sepultura Formation, Fig. 17).\n\nOutstanding exposure in the Rosario forearc basin permits detailed studies of depositional systems in a very tectonically active basin (Figs. 18,19 and 20). Alluvial fan -fluvial systems of the El Gallo Formation (Fulford and Busby-Spera, 1993) provide a sedimentologic record of intrabasinal reverse faulting (Escarpa Member) and basin-margin normal faulting Figs. 17 and 21a,b). High subsidence and sedimentation rates led to development of very thick fluvial overbank successions with minimal soil development (Fig. 21c), promoting preservation of abundant dinosaur fossils (Morris, 1974), as well as fossilized wood fragments (Fig. 21d).\n\nThe latest Campanian to Mastrichtian Rosario Formation records bathyal marine sedimentation along the length of the Peninsular Ranges forearc basin complex, from El Rosario (Fig. 3) to southern California; George and Dokka (1994) correlated this abrupt increase in paleo-water depths with a Late Cretaceous (ca. 76 Ma), 4 -5-km exhumation event inferred from fission track studies of apatites in the northern Peninsular Ranges. These were both attributed to the onset of Laramide flat slab subduction (George and Dokka, 1994), although a mechanism for increased forearc basin subsidence was not given.\n\nThe San Carlos section of the Rosario Formation (Fig. 17A) is recognized as a submarine canyon (Fig. 18) because it is an erosively based feature filled with bathyal marine deposits and bound laterally by contemporaneous bathyal marine slope deposits (Morris and Busby-Spera, 1988). Its U-shaped base is typical of the lower reaches of submarine canyons (Shepard Fig. 16. Outcrop photos of the phase 3 extensional forearc basin atop subduction complexes on the Vizcaino Peninsula and Cedros Island (Figs. 4,5 and 15).

(h) Finingand thinning-upward sequence of sandstone beds filling a turbidite channel. Fig. 17. Geologic map and tectonstratigraphic chart of strike-slip forearc basin built upon arc massif basement during phase 3 (Fig. 2): the Rosario forearc basin (locality shown in Fig. 3). Rapidly alternating contractional and extensional events are shown; these resulted in ''porpoising'' of the basin between nonmarine and bathyal marine environments. Formations defined by Kilmer (1963); lower and upper sequence of Rosario Formation defined by Morris and Busby (1996). and Dill, 1966), consistent with the presence of lower bathyal marine foraminifera. This indicates that the basin deepened very rapidly from east to west. The lower conglomerate sandstone unit (Fig. 18) consists of amalgamated channels filled with conglomerate or sandstone (Fig. 21e), interstratified with intraformational slide blocks up to 100 m long (Fig. 21f), with broken margins containing abundant injection structures (Fig. 21g). Load structures are common, and in places these detached completely from the gravelly sediment gravity flow into liquefied sands to form giant psuedonodules (Fig. 21h), suggestive of high sedimentation rates. The middle mudstone -sandstone unit (Fig. 18) consists of slumped mudstones, indicating high axial gradients on the canyon floor, as well as a single aggradational turbiditic sandstone channel with abundant traction structures. The upper conglomerate-sandstone unit is similar to the lower one except that it is smaller in volume (Fig. 18). The coarse grain size, large slide sheets, liquifaction structures and Fig. 18.

Reconstruction of a deepwater valley levee complex of the Rosario Formation in the Arroyo San Fernando area (Fig. 17). Note vertical exaggeration.\n\ninferred deep basin, steep axial canyon gradient and high sedimentation rates are all consistent with deposition in a very tectonically active basin.\n\nThe Arroyo San Fernando section of the Rosario Formation (Fig. 17) is interpreted to represent a deepwater valley -levee complex (Fig. 19) because it consists of stacked, bathyal marine channelinterchannel turbidites (Fig. 21i) that aggraded vertically due to confinement by bathyal marine levee deposits (Fig. 21j; Morris and Busby-Spera, 1990). Comparisons with seismic data on young subsurface systems suggest that the Arroyo San Fernando levees may be more intensely slumped than many others, perhaps due to frequent seismic activity in the forearc strike slip basin (Dykstra and Kneller, 2002).\n\nThe Punta Canoas section of the Sepulture Formation (Fig. 17 and 21k) was dominated by marine conglomerates that may be the sedimentary record of a late Early Paleocene (ca. 62 Ma) uplift event inferred from fission track thermochronology of the Peninsular Ranges in California (Dokka, 1984). An earlier influx of conglomerates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, however, is hypothesized to record resedimentation events triggered by seismicity caused by the Chicxulub bolide impact (Busby et al.,Fig. 20. Transverse and longitudinal cross-sections through Cretaceous -Tertiary boundary coastal paleovalley in Canon San Fernando (Fig. 17), modified from Busby et al. (2002). The 5-km-wide and >15-km-long valley was carved by catastrophic landsliding of Rosario Formation (dark green), and filled with Rosario-derived giant slide sheets (pale green) interstratified with massive shallow-marine conglomerates (dark blue).

These Cretaceous -Tertiary boundary conglomerates occur in a coastal paleovalley (Fig. 20) preserved in present-day Canon San Fernando (Fig. 17). This coastal paleovalley (Fig. 20) formed by massive gravitational collapses, and rapidly filled with coastal (shallow marine and lesser fluvial) gravels and sands, as well as slide sheets of marine mudstone that range from meters to kilometers in length (Fig. 21m). 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates on pumice lapilli tuffs from the base and the top of the section (Fig. 21l) are indistinguishable in age from Haitian tektites dated by the same lab, and show that the section accumulated very rapidly (Busby et al., 2002, and unpublished data).

Schematic tectonic reconstruction of the Baja California margin through Mesozoic time.\n\nMesozoic to Paleocene rocks of the Baja California Peninsula provide an opportunity to study a very wellexposed, areally extensive, long-lived convergentmargin complex. Like modern convergent margins, it shows an overall evolution from extensional to compressional strain regimes, divided into three phases in this paper (Fig. 22).\n\nExtension characterized the early history of not only the Mesozoic arc of Baja California, but also the Mesozoic arc of the southwestern Cordilleran United States and South America. This superregional tectonic regime may have been controlled largely by slab age (Busby-Spera et al., 1990a) because the paleo-Pacific Ocean basin at the time of breakup of Pangea was probably composed of large, relatively old, cold plates. Early Mesozoic extension of continental crust in the southwestern United States created intra-arc and forearc graben-depressions filled with kilometers of volcanic and sedimentary rock (Busby-Spera, 1988a,b;Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992); these contributed significantly to the growth of the continental margin. Similarly, Mesozoic extension of transitional to oceanic crust in outboard parts of the convergent margin created arc-related basins filled with volcanic and sedimentary rock (Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992;Busby et al., 1998); these nonsubductible items were accreted to present-day California and Baja California during the later, compressional stage of convergence, causing growth of the continent.\n\nPhase one in Baja California, strongly extensional arc -ophiolite systems of Late Triassic to Late Jurassic age (Fig. 22, time frame I), has analogues in the fringing arc -ophiolite terranes of the Klamath-Sierran and Coast Ranges of California (Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992), although some workers argue that these terranes are exotic to both of the Californias (Dickinson and Lawton, 2001). These terranes consist of rifted oceanic arcs and suprasubduction zone ophiolites directly overlain by arc volcanic -volcaniclastic rocks.\n\nThe Late Triassic to Late Jurassic arc -ophiolite systems of Baja California appear to differ from those of northern California by lacking evidence for Middle and Late Jurassic shortening events (e.g. thrust faults, folds and cleavage). These shortening events in northern California have been attributed to accretion of exotic or fringing arcs along subduction zones of controversial numbers and polarities (Schweickert and Cowan, 1975;Dickinson et al., 1996;Dilek andMoores, 1993, 1995;Godfrey and Dilek, 2000). Alternatively, the Middle and Late Jurassic shortening events in northern California have been interpreted to record transpressional deformation along a single subduction zone that dipped eastward under the continent (Saleeby and Busby-Spera, 1992). In this alternative model, a broad right bend in the sinistral oblique subduction margin caused shortening along the northern California segment of the convergent margin, while at the same time, to the south in southern California and southern Arizona, a broad left bend in the sinistral oblique subduction margin caused transtension (Busby-Spera et al., 1990b;Adams et al., 1997;Busby et al., in press). I propose here that this southern transtensional belt extended farther south into the Mexican margin, resulted in amalgamation of oceanic arc terranes and continental margin terranes without causing significant shortening (Fig. 22, time frame II).\n\nPhase two in Baja California, moderately extensional fringing arc -forearc systems of Early Cretaceous age (Fig. 22, time frame III), has an analogue in the fringing arc of the northern Peninsular ranges in California (Santiago Peak Volcanics), although some workers argue that the arc in Baja California (Alisitos Group) is an exotic rather than fringing arc (Wetmore et al., 2002). This fringing arc does not have an analogue in northern California, where shortening along the Middle to Late Jurassic convergent margin resulted in collapse of fringing arcs against the continental margin to form a thickened crustal basement for the Early Cretaceous arc. Instead, the Mexican convergent margin was characterized by ongoing extension, similar to the Cretaceous convergent margin of South America. This extension ended in late Early Cretaceous time, when decreasing slab dip and increasing convergence resulted in backarc basin closure and development of a compressional continental arc (Fig. 22, time frame IV).\n\nPhase three in Baja California, compressional arc system of Late Cretaceous age, (Fig. 22, time frame V), consists of a high-standing continental arc, with accretion of blueschist metamorphic rocks and development of extensional forearc basins formed by gravitational collapse of the accretionary wedge. These all have direct analogues in the Klamath -Sierra arc and the Franciscan complex of California. Later in phase three, oblique strongly coupled subduction resulted in development of Late Cretaceous to Paleocene forearc strike slip basins in the present day Peninsular Ranges (Fig. 22, time frame VI). Late Cretaceous forearc basins of strike slip origin have not been recognized in California, but intra-arc strike slip faults of that age are present in the Sierra Nevada batholith (e.g. Busby-Spera and Saleeby, 1990;Glazner, 1991).\n\nAll three phases of convergence contributed substantially to the growth of the North American continental margin.\n\nThe schematic tectonic model presented in Fig. 22 takes the view that all of the Mesozoic elements that added to the growth of the Mexican margin were formed and accreted within the upper plate of the convergent-margin onshore and offshore of North America (except for oceanic materials offscraped into the accretionary wedge of phase three). This is in contrast with the other end member model, which proposes that many of the elements are exotic to North America, and were accreted by closure of major (not marginal) ocean basins (Dickinson and Lawton, 2001;Umhoefer, in press). My more ''fixist'' model is consistent with the geologic data in hand, and must be considered a viable option. It may explain similarities in Mesozoic tectonic styles between Baja California and adjacent parts of North America and South America.\n\nC.Busby / Tectonophysics 392 (2004) 241-277"
