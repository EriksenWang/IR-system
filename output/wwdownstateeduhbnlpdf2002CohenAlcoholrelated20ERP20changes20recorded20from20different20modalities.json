    "abstract": "Background: There is controversy in the literature regarding the relationship between event-relatedpotential (ERP) abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics and stimulus-processing modality (i.e., visual versus auditory). The first purpose of this study was to address questions about whether ERP abnormalities observed in alcoholics are modality specific. The second purpose was to employ current source density (CSD) analyses to investigate topographic differences between alcoholics and controls within each modality.\nMethods: Data were collected from 30 sober male alcoholics and 39 normal males in a typical auditory oddball task and in a visual oddball paradigm with novel stimuli, with an extensive set of 61 scalp electrodes. Visual and quantitative assessment of CSD maps as well as analyses of variances on both raw and normalized ERP data were performed.\nResults: Positive findings were limited to the N1 and P3 components. The visual N1 amplitude was significantly smaller in alcoholics than in controls at the parietal region; no significant group differences in N1 were found in the auditory modality. Alcoholics had widespread reductions in P3 amplitudes in both modalities compared with controls, although in the frontal region this effect was partially due to the influence of age. These P3 reductions in alcoholics were statistically more pronounced in the posterior compared with the anterior regions regardless of modality. Topographically, sources in CSD maps were weaker in alcoholics than in controls; in the frontal and central regions, the weakness was more pronounced in the auditory modality but, in parietal and occipital regions, it was more pronounced in the visual modality.\nConclusions: The results suggest that, in abstinent alcoholics, abnormalities in auditory ERPs may be localized to more anterior sources, while abnormalities in visual ERPs may be localized to more posterior sources. ERP topographic features are more sensitive than amplitude measurements in assessing alcoholicrelated modality effects.",
    "full_text": "E VENT RELATED POTENTIALS (ERPs) recorded in the oddball paradigm have provided abundant measurements that differentiate groups with and without alcohol dependence (Glenn et al., 1996;Porjesz and Begleiter, 1996). The most robust ERP feature is the lower P3 amplitude in abstinent alcoholics (Cohen et al., 1995;Emmerson et al., 1987, Glenn et al., 1994, Pfefferbaum et al., 1987;Porjesz et al., 1980;Porjesz and Begleiter, 1987); decreased N1 amplitude as well as prolonged N2 and P3 latencies are less consistent findings (Glenn et al., 1996;Porjesz and Begleiter, 1987;Romani and Cosi, 1989). The typical oddball task given to sober alcoholics requires effortful or controlled processes, because subjects are making a buttonpress response or mentally counting the number of target stimuli (Pfefferbaum et al., 1991;Porjesz et al., 1980). The target stimulus is usually the oddball which appears randomly and less frequently in a series of more frequent and physically different (i.e., high versus low tone or triangle versus square shapes) stimuli in either the auditory or visual modality; in a dual-modality paradigm, it is the attended oddball within one modality with respect to the rare stimulus of the other modality (Porjesz and Begleiter, 1983). In precise terms, the target-elicited P3 in such paradigms is actually the P3b component, and the reduction in its amplitude is a widely observed phenomenon in alcoholics (Porjesz and Begleiter, 1996). This observation is further corroborated by single trial analyses, which take the variability of latency into consideration (Pfefferbaum et al., 1991). In contrast, some investigations of P3b have failed to observe an amplitude deficit in male (Hill et al., 1995(Hill et al., ,1999;;Steinhauer et al., 1987) and female (Hill et al., 1999;Parsons, 1994;Parsons et al., 1990) alcoholics and in auditory (Hill et al., 1995(Hill et al., ,1999;;Parsons et al., 1990;Steinhauer et al., 1987) and visual (Hill et al., 1999;Parsons, 1994;Parsons et al., 1990) paradigms. In addition, the P3 voltage responses to novel, nontarget stimuli (P3a) (Biggins et al., 1995), or no-go stimuli (Pfefferbaum et al., 1987) do not manifest differences between alcoholics and controls. However, recent studies (Hada et al., 2000;Holguin et al., 1999) report that the P3a amplitude is lower in alcoholics than controls to rare deviant nontargets. The N1 and N2 components are thought to be more passive and less targetdependent (Naatanen and Picton, 1987;Ritter et al., 1984) compared with the target-elicited P3, which reflects a relatively controlled process (Bashore and van der Molen, 1991). While a lengthened N2 latency without the concomitant amplitude reduction has been reported (Glenn et al., 1993;Porjesz et al., 1987), decreased N2 without prolonged latency has also been reported (Realmuto et al., 1993). Mixed reports also have been observed with regard to the N1 amplitude reduction (Kaseda et al., 1994;Miyazato and Ogura, 1993;Oscar-Berman, 1987;Realmuto et al., 1993), especially when target and nontarget elicited ERPs were both examined (Glenn et al., 1996).\n\nFurther, although these ERP aberrations were observed in auditory, visual, and dual-modality oddball paradigms, it seems that, in alcoholics, paradigms employing visual stimuli are most likely to elicit decreased P3 and N1 amplitudes (Ciesielski et al., 1985;Cohen et al., 1995;Glenn et al., 1993;Parsons, 1994;Steinhauer et al., 1987). The inconsistency among studies mentioned above could be due to a number of variables: (1) different percentages of alcoholic subjects with positive family histories (Patterson et al., 1987), a variable considered to be an important contributor to the observed P3 amplitude reduction in alcoholics (Cohen et al., 1995;Pfefferbaum et al., 1991); and/or (2) differences in subjects' ages (Glenn et al., 1996;Picton et al., 1984); and/or, (3) differences in difficulty level (Porjesz et al., 1987). It is possible that ERPs in different modalities may be differentially sensitive to alcoholism (Pfefferbaum et al., 1991). In Pfefferbaum et al. (1991), alcoholics showed smaller P3 amplitudes in both auditory and visual paradigms but had later and more frontally distributed P3 amplitudes only in the visual paradigm. While studies showed controversially that visual and auditory P3 components may involve different neural generators (Ji et al., 1999;Johnson, 1993;Naumann et al., 1992), studies of N1 and N2 components agreed that these negative components are actually modality-dependent (Naatanen and Picton, 1987;Ritter et al., 1984). Considering that different topographic regions may manifest peak activity to the same stimuli in different modalities, it is natural to hypothesize that there may be differences in sensitivities between alcoholics and controls to modality-specific features of stimuli. Such sensitivity differences may be partly responsible for the diverse results found in the literature regarding whether there are ERP changes in alcoholics using different oddball paradigms. Thus, one of the purposes of the present study is to further investigate the modality specific ERP features of alcoholics by directly comparing auditory and visual ERPs obtained in the same subjects with an extensive set of scalp-recording sites (61 sites).\n\nBy employing 61 scalp-recording sites, it is possible for us not only to conduct regional analyses of ERP data between auditory and visual paradigms in alcoholics but also to provide a better resolution of scalp topography in terms of current source density (CSD) maps. Therefore, besides cross-validation of ERP amplitude and latency changes in alcoholics, the scalp topography based on 61 scalp sites enables us to extend our investigation to the topographic features of P3 components in alcoholics and healthy controls within and across sensory modalities. By performing topographic analyses of ERP data in two sensory modalities in alcoholics, we attempt to advance the understanding of source localization of alcoholic ERP changes (Oades et al., 1995).\n\nIn summary, this study examines the ERP differences between sober alcoholics and normal controls, based on data recorded from 61 scalp electrode sites to both auditory and visual stimuli. Neither any modality difference by itself nor any group difference alone is emphasized in this study. Rather, our interests emphasize those group differences that appeared true/stronger in one modality and false/ weaker in another modality or those modality differences that seemed true/stronger in one subject group and false/ weaker in the other subject group.\n\nThirty male experimental subjects (30.33 Ϯ 4.31, between 21 and 37 years old) and 39 male control subjects (24.67 Ϯ 3.30, between 20 and 33 years old) participated in the experiment. Alcoholics were recruited from Kings County Hospital; all individuals met DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence and had been detoxified in a 30-day treatment program prior to testing. However, they were neither released to us nor to their own community unless they were no longer in withdrawal.\n\nTable 1 presents MMSE (Mini Mental Status Examination) scores, education, age of onset, drinks per day, and number of drinking days per month. Controls were recruited either through notices posted in the SUNY Health Science Center or via newspaper ads. The screening procedure required each control and alcoholic individual to fill out a questionnaire detailing alcohol and drug use and the medical (including psychiatric) histories for both himself and his relatives. Inclusion in the control group depended on both the responses to the questionnaire and the requirement that none of the candidate's first-or second-degree relatives be diagnosed with any kind of alcohol-related disorder. Exclusionary criteria for both groups included major medical problems, a current requirement for medication with effects on the central nervous system (CNS), or a history of psychiatric problems. These clinical data were obtained with the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) (Bucholz et al., 1994), an instrument developed by COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) that uses both DSM-III-R and Feighner criteria for the determination of alcoholism (Begleiter et al., 1995). Subjects were neither excluded from the study for having ever had psychotropic medications for purposes other than detoxification nor for being polydrug abusers with dependencies on other drugs secondary to alcoholism. Subjects were requested to abstain from alcohol and other CNS-acting substances for 5 days prior to testing. A second questionnaire, administered on the day of testing, documented drug use (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, methadone, tranquilizer, antidepressants, neuroleptics, other prescribed medications, nicotine, caffeine) over the previous 5 days and the several hours prior to testing. The subject's responses to these questions could be cause to cancel the session and reschedule. Further, on the day of testing, the subjects were given both a urine screen and a breathalyzer. Positive findings on the former would exclude the subject's ERP data from any analyses, whereas a value greater than zero on the latter would be cause to cancel the session and reschedule. All subjects were right-handed and had normal or corrected normal vision. Although the subjects were not given an audiometric exam, no one in either group had difficulty hearing the tones or discriminating between them, nor was anyone excluded from the study because of a hearing problem. Males were used exclusively to maximize the likelihood of obtaining cognitive-based hemispheric differences (Halpern, 1992).\n\nEEG activity was recorded monopolarly using a 61-lead electrode cap (Electro-cap International, Inc., Eaton, OH) referred to the nose, with the impedances kept below 5 kOhms and a forehead ground. The vertical and horizontal electro-oculogram (EOG) were recorded. The signals were amplified with a gain of 10,000 by a set of amplifiers (Sensorium, Charlotte, VT) with a bandpass of 0.02-50 Hz, and recorded on a Concurrent 5550 computer (Concurrent Computer Corp., Atlanta, GA) with subsequent 32-Hz low-pass digital filtering. The sampling rate was 256 Hz. The total length of the ERP epoch was 1500 msec for the auditory paradigm and 1620 msec for the visual paradigm, including a prestimulus baseline of 187 msec. After digital filtering, the prestimulus baseline epoch was 125 msec. Trials with artifacts (Ͼ73.3 v) were rejected online.\n\nFor the auditory P3, the subject was presented with up to 400 binaural stimuli with uniform interstimulus interval (ISI) of 1500 msec. There were two types of stimuli: a 600-Hz low tone and a 1600-Hz high tone. Each stimulus had a 60-msec duration (10 msec r/f, 40-msec plateau) and an intensity level of 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). The rare and frequent (standard) tones had 12.5% and 87.5% probabilities of occurrence, respectively. The designation of the low-or high-frequency tone as the rare stimulus was alternated across subjects. The auditory stimuli were presented binaurally through headphones (model ER-3A Tubephone Insert Earphones, 50-ohm impedance; Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL); the ear piece and a short length of the Tubephone were fitted under the electrode cap, and the individual left and right transducer cases were situated on either side of the neck.\n\nVisual P3s were elicited with 280 stimuli presented on a computer monitor for a duration of 60 msec, with an interstimulus interval of 1.6 sec. The target (12.5% of total stimuli) was a white letter \"X\" (4 ϫ 4 cm, 2.9°ϫ 2.9°), the standard nontarget (75%) was a white square (4 ϫ 4 cm, 2.9°ϫ 2.9°), and the novel stimuli (12.5%) consisted of nonrepeating colored geometric shapes (5 ϫ 5 cm, 3.6°ϫ 3.6°) arranged in variegated patterns.\n\nThe subject was seated in a reclining chair located in a sound-attenuated RF-shielded room (IAC, Industrial Acoustics, Bronx, NY) and fixated on a point in the center of a computer display located 1 m away from his eyes.\n\nSubjects were instructed to press a mouse button with their forefinger (response hand was counterbalanced across subjects) whenever a target was detected and to refrain from responding when the novel or standard stimuli occurred. The button-press action terminated a clock started at stimulus onset and defined the response time. The auditory experiment could be terminated after as few as 100 artifact-free trials (a minimum of 25 target and 75 nontarget trials) were acquired. The visual experiment terminated automatically after a minimum of 25 target stimuli, 150 nontarget stimuli, and 25 novel, artifact-free trials had been acquired, or when all 280 stimuli had been shown. The designation of the modality sequence (visual first or auditory first) was alternated across subjects.\n\nTrials (both visual and auditory paradigms) with response times Ͼ1000 msec were rejected. The ERPs from accepted trials were automatically placed in target, novel (visual only), and nontarget response categories for subsequent summation, averaging, and statistical analysis. Response speed was emphasized, but not at the cost of accuracy.\n\nInitially, it should be noted that the following data analyses reflect a retrospective study of existing data rather than a prospective study designed to address modality-related P3 differences both within and between subjects. Both the auditory and visual P3 data were acquired over a narrow time period on the same day for a given individual and under the same experimental conditions for all subjects.\n\nA semiautomatic peak detection program was employed to analyze the average ERPs to target, standard nontarget, and novel (visual only) stimuli. This paper reports only target data analysis. An auditory P3 was selected as the largest positive peak within a time window from 215 to 430 msec. Visual P3 was selected as the largest amplitude peak within a time window from 215 to 530 msec. Pz was used for the peak detection of P3. N1, P2, and N2 were measured respectively as the maximum negative peaks in the latency range of 62-183 msec for auditory N1, 78 -195 msec for visual N1; the maximum positive peak in the latency range of 117-238 msec for auditory P2, 144 -300 msec for visual P2; the maximum negative peak in the latency range of 152-281 msec for auditory N2, and 218 -355 for visual N2. Fz was used for the peak detection of all of these components except for visual N1, which was most clearly visualized at Oz. Peak amplitudes were measured with respect to a 125-msec prestimulus baseline. Latencies were measured from the time of stimulus onset to the peak of each component. All the measurements were qualified by separate visual inspection. The grand mean ERPs at three electrodes over the scalp (Fz, Cz, Pz) elicited by target stimuli for both modalities and both groups are presented in Fig. 1 (upper: control auditory ERP versus alcoholic auditory ERP; bottom: control visual ERP versus alcoholic visual ERP).\n\nStatistical analyses of ERP data were only conducted on artifact-free trials with correct behavioral responses. Five regional groupings of the 61 electrodes were created for regional analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2. MANCOVAs (SAS v6.11, Proc GLM, SAS, Cary, NC) (group ϩ modality ϩ age ϩ modality ϫ group ϩ group ϫ age) were used to perform between group comparisons for P3, N2, and P2 amplitudes and latencies in each of the five brain regions. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) (SAS v6.11,Proc GLM) were used to evaluate modality effects when alcoholic and control subjects were examined separately.\n\nFor individual ERP measurements, auditory N1 is difficult to detect at posterior electrode sites, while the visual N1 is difficult to recognize at anterior electrode sites. Therefore, regional analyses of N1 amplitudes and latencies were not performed across modalities; instead, the analyses were conducted in the frontal and central regions for the auditory N1 and in the parietal, occipital, and temporal regions for visual N1.\n\nTopographic analyses were performed on both raw and normalized ERP data. The raw ERP amplitudes were normalized by the MinMax procedure described by McCarthy and Wood (1985). The minimum and maximum grand mean ERP amplitudes were found separately for each group and each modality. The minimum grand mean amplitude was subtracted from the raw amplitude at each location, then divided by the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes. Both normalized and raw datasets were subjected to repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). The coronal effect (frontal, central, parietal, and occipital) was tested along five sagittal planes (far left: F7/5, T7/C5, P7/5; midleft: F3/1, C3/1, P3/1; midline: AFz/Fz, FCz/Cz, CPz/Pz, POz/Oz; midright: F4/2, C4/2, P4/2; far right: F8/6, T8/C6, P8/6); the laterality effect (left, right) was tested for five brain regions separately. Univariate, modified univariate (Greenhouse-Geisser corrections), or multivariate results were reported where appropriate.\n\nIn addition, topographic maps were created by employing a referencefree model (Perrin et al., 1989;Wang et al., 1994). The CSD (unit:\n\nV/r 2 /cm 2 ) maps were created by using the spherical spine method to obtain the second spatial derivative of the voltage fields. Positive values of the current source density indicate local current flow out of the skull, whereas negative values indicate current flow into the skull.\n\nThe response time (msec) for alcoholics (auditory: 428.68 Ϯ 114.68; visual: 458.34 Ϯ 74.41)\n\nThe peak amplitudes and latencies for P3, N2, and P2 over four midline scalp sites were plotted in Figs. 3, 4, and 5, respectively (part \"a\" for amplitude, part \"b\" for latency). Figure 3a illustrates that group differences in P3 amplitude are stronger than modality differences and that, within groups, P3 amplitudes at midline electrodes look very similar between modalities. Figure 4a indicates that, in controls, the modality difference in N2 peak amplitude is relatively stable across four scalp sites, resembling the modality difference in the P3 peak; however, in alcoholics, the modality difference in N2 peak amplitude varied over the scalp sites. Figure 5a indicates that the modality difference in P2 peak amplitude was more pronounced at the anterior sites than at the posterior sites for both groups. Compared with Figs. 3a, 4a, and 5a, the distinguishing feature in Figs. 3b, 4b, and 5b was that the ERP latencies were more differentiated by modality than by group.\n\nTable 2a summarizes the modality effect obtained from MANCOVAS and MANOVAS performed on P3 responses. For P3 amplitudes there is a significant age ϫ group effect [MANCOVA,F(17,116) ϭ 1.87, p Ͻ 0.05], which indicates that for each group, age has a different influence on P3 amplitudes recorded at frontal sites. This interaction makes any differences between the two groups at frontal sites less statistically sound due to the violation of the parallel requirement in conducting MANCOVA. Nevertheless, at central and occipital regions, overall modality effects are obtained without any significant interaction effects (Table 2a). Further examination of means in each modality for each of the 13 peak amplitudes in the central region and 8 peak amplitudes in the occipital region failed to reveal a clear pattern regarding which modality evinced a larger P3. Some electrodes recorded larger P3 amplitudes in the auditory modality while others in the same region  recorded larger P3 amplitudes in the visual modality. On the other hand, when electrode sites were considered as repeated measurements and modality was examined as a between-subject effect, the significant modality effects in Table 2a were no longer significant at frontal, central, and occipital regions. The results of MANOVA (examining modality effects separately for the two groups) indicated that while no significant modality effect was obtained over all brain regions in alcoholics, significant modality effects were ob-served for controls in frontal and central areas (Table 2a), where visual P3 amplitude tended to be larger than auditory P3 amplitude.\n\nFor P3 latencies, the modality effect was significant for both groups at all five brain regions and remained significant when the two groups were included in a single MAN-COVA model with age as a covariate (Table 2a). The lack of an interaction between group and modality/age as well as examinations of the mean latency values in each brain region indicate that, regardless of group, visual P3 is generally later than auditory P3.\n\nN2 and P2. Table 2b summarizes the results of MAN- COVAs used to examine modality effects on N2 and P2. For N2 and P2 amplitudes, significant modality effects were obtained in all regions without concomitant interactions between group ϫ modality or age. The modality effect on peak N2 amplitude was caused by the more negative N2 in the auditory modality compared with the visual modality. The P2 modality effect was caused by a larger P2 in the visual modality compared with the auditory modality.\n\nSimilar to P3 latencies, N2 and P2 latencies were later in the visual than the auditory modality. Due to the problems described previously, no comparisons across modalities were made for N1.\n\nModality Specific/Nonspecific Group Difference Peak Amplitudes. As presented above, the age ϫ group effect in regional MANCOVAs was not significant except at frontal scalp sites. Thus, for central, parietal, occipital, and temporal regions, the age ϫ group effect was not examined. P3 amplitudes were significantly different between alcoholics and controls at central [F(14,120) ϭ 2.99, p Ͻ 0.001]; parietal [F(10,124) ϭ 3.17, p Ͻ 0.01]; occipital [F(8,126) ϭ 2.75, p Ͻ 0.01]; and temporal [F(12,122) ϭ 3.12, p Ͻ 0.001] regions, but none of these effects was modality specific (group ϫ modality interactions were not significant). In both modalities, P3 amplitudes were lower in alcoholics than in controls (Fig. 3a). In the frontal region, the P3 amplitude difference between alcoholics and controls [F(17,116) ϭ 1.86, p Ͻ 0.05] was confounded by the influence of age. No modality specific or modality nonspecific group differences were found in P2 and N2 amplitudes. In the frontal and central regions, auditory N1 amplitudes were not significantly different between alco-holics and controls; visual N1 amplitudes were significantly smaller in alcoholics than in controls in the parietal region [F(10,57) ϭ 2.10, p Ͻ 0.05] but not in the occipital [F(8,59) ϭ 0.42, p ϭ 0.91] or temporal [F(12,55) ϭ 0.61, p ϭ 0.83] regions.\n\nPeak Latencies. P3 latencies were not different between alcoholics and controls in any of the five brain regions; this nonsignificant group effect was modality nonspecific (as indicated previously, none of the group ϫ modality interactions was significant). Similar results were obtained for P2, N1, and N2 latencies.\n\nTopographic Profile. We first analyzed the coronal effect (frontal, central, parietal, and occipital) and its interactions with groups and modalities along five sagittal planes (far left, midleft, midline, midright, and far right). Then, we analyzed the laterality effect (left versus right) and its interactions with groups and modalities for each of the five brain regions (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal). Unless otherwise specified, the age ϫ group effect was not significant in any of the following analyses.\n\nCoronal Effect. Along the far left sagittal plane, the coronal (frontal, central-temporal, parietal-temporal) ϫ modality effect [F(2,131) ϭ 3.93_norm or 4.32_raw, p Ͻ 0.05] and modality effect [F(6,127) ϭ 3.06_norm or 2.29_raw, p Ͻ 0.05] were significant, while the coronal ϫ group or coronal ϫ group ϫ modality interactions, as well as all other effects were not significant. Along the midleft sagittal plane, except for the modality effect [F(6,127) ϭ 3.29_norm or 3.53_raw, p Ͻ 0.01], none of the other effects was significant. Along the midline electrode sites, P3 had a parietal maximum distribution [F(3,130) ϭ 3.63_norm or\n\nTable 2a.

The alcoholic subjects were divided into both a low-density (LD) and a high-density (HD) group. The LD group (n ϭ 17) consisted of individuals with either 0 or 1 alcoholic relatives (X ϭ 0.24[0.44] relatives/individual), while the HD group (n ϭ 11) consisted of individuals with either 3, 4, or 5 alcoholic relatives (X ϭ 3.64[0.92] relatives/individual). Comparisons between the groups were made using both auditory P3 and visual P3 responses recorded at Pz. The results of these analyses yielded one group difference in an unexpected direction, i.e., auditory P3 amplitude was greater in the HD group than the LD group (HD: X ϭ 22.4 uV versus LD: X ϭ 15.2 uV; p Ͻ 0.0008). However, given the small number of subjects in each group, we do not give any physiologic significance to this result.\n\nFigure 8 presents CSD maps around P3 peak latency, as well as 50 msec before and after peak latency, for each modality and group. The 50 msec before and after the peak latency were chosen to reflect the dynamic changes of the source pattern that, on visual inspection, appear to last about 100 msec.\n\nAuditory P3. Visual assessment of the two CSD maps at peak latency in the auditory modality revealed little difference between alcoholics and controls, except that the sources (red spots) around the Pz electrode and frontaltemporal region in alcoholics seemed weaker than those in controls. However, the dynamic changes in the source pattern were quite different between alcoholics and controls; the appearance of the left frontal-temporal source was more prominent in controls compared with alcoholics, and the diffusion of sources after peak latency seems more widely distributed in controls compared with alcoholics.\n\nVisual P3. In the visual modality, the sources around both parietal and right frontal-temporal regions were much weaker in alcoholics than in controls, and the parietal sources tended to diffuse rightward only in control subjects.\n\nTopographic Symmetry. To obtain a quantitative assessment of the topographical symmetry of CSD maps of different groups under different modalities at different time points, an analysis applying a bootstrap method (Ji et al., 1998;Srebro, 1996) was performed for each group. For each subject, a CSD map was calculated for the average of five consecutive sample points around 50 msec before peak latency, at peak latency, and 50 msec after peak latency. Then, 30 maps for the alcoholic group (39 maps for the control group), chosen randomly with replacement from the 30 subject maps, were averaged. This was done 200 times to provide a basis for statistical analysis. For the left frontal-right frontal comparison, the midline points produced by the current density calculation were removed, leaving 293 points on each side for the symmetry calculation. The Pearson correlation (r) between the left and right points for each of the 200 maps was calculated and then subjected to the Fisher Z transform, in order to apply a Student's t test to the values. Pooled datasets were formed by randomly taking data from either the left or right frontal sites. The Pearson correlation between the 200 maps and a nonidentical permutation of them was calculated and then subjected to the Fisher Z transform. To determine whether the degree of symmetry in the maps was statistically significant, a two-sample Student's t test was applied to the left-right data and the pooled data. The left-right correlations were all significantly different (p Ͻ 0.001) from the pooled correlations, indicating the statistical significance of the measures of symmetry of the CSD pattern over the frontal hemisphere. This is a necessary condition for the intergroup comparisons. If, on the other hand, the correlations were not different between the left-right and the pooled data, then either the left and right data are close to identical or there is too much variability between subjects for any comparisons to have statistical significance.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of correlations for each group under each modality and at each time point. The alcoholic group has a significantly smaller correlation (p Ͻ 0.0001) than the control group, indicating greater asymmetry. Inspection of Table 3 and Fig. 8 demonstrates that, in the visual modality, the lateral frontal sources are more asymmetrical in the alcoholic group relative to the control group, especially around the time before peak latency; however, over time, the lateral frontal sources become less asymmetrical.\n\nThe topographic morphology of the N1 wave manifested visually discernible differences between the auditory and visual modality, with auditory-anteriorly and visualposteriorly distributed patterns; this was true for both alcoholics and controls. However, alcoholics compared with controls manifested a statistically significant reduction of N1 responses in the parietal region but only to visual stimuli. This is partially consistent with studies of Parsons et al. (1990), Patterson et al. (1987), andPfefferbaum et al. (1979), in which visual N1 was found to be reduced in alcoholics at Cz and Pz while auditory N1 did not demonstrate sensitivity to alcoholism itself (rather to family history). Although this study and studies by Kathmann et al. (1996) and Glenn et al. (1993) did not find a group effect for auditory N1, both Miyazato and Ogura (1993) and Glenn et al. (1994) demonstrated reduced auditory N1 amplitudes at frontal and central regions in alcoholics. According to Naatanen and Picton (1987), the N1 responses to auditory stimuli consist of at least three components, which reflect the physical and temporal aspects of the stimuli and the general state of the subject. Whereas auditory N1 has a frontocentral distribution (Naatanen and Picton, 1987), visual N1 is recorded more posteriorly on the scalp (Perrault and Picton, 1984). The overlapping structure of these subcomponents may contribute to the incon-Fig. 8. Current source density maps of target P3 sec around 50 msec before peak latencies (the upper row), at peak latencies (the middle row), and 50 msec after peak latencies (the bottom row) for controls in the auditory modality (1st column), alcoholics in the auditory modality (2nd column), controls in the visual modality (3rd column), and alcoholics in the visual modality (4th column). The unit for the scale is V/r 2 /cm 2 , r ϭ radius of head.\n\nsistent findings regarding N1 reduction between modalities and across studies. As the N1 wave is not considered to be a unitary event and there is no direct evidence indicating which unique aspects of the present N1 are reflected in this visual paradigm, the reduced N1 electrical voltages at parietal brain regions of alcoholics cannot be interpreted along any single underlying cerebral process. However, the N1 wave obtained in a similar visual paradigm (Knight, 1997) manifested prominent reductions in cerebrovascular stroke patients with prefrontal and posterior cortical lesions; the distribution pattern of the N1 reductions in these patients suggested that the visual N1 may be related to a net excitatory prefrontal pathway to extrastriate regions active during sustained attention. The observed visual N1 reduction may reflect the fact that communication among structures in the visual attentional network is poor in alcoholics. Therefore, one is more likely to record altered N1 responses from alcoholics in centroparietal scalp sites despite the experimental evidence that N1 appears to be generated in frontal and/or temporal regions (Naatanen and Picton, 1987).\n\nConsistent with other studies (Kathmann et al., 1996;Parsons et al., 1990;Pfefferbaum et al., 1991;Romani and Cosi, 1989), there are no positive findings regarding the N2 and P2 components. Among the ERP components examined, the test-retest correlations are higher for N1 and P3 amplitude for both alcoholic and control subjects compared with the other ERP measurements (Sinha et al., 1992). The relatively weak reliability of the P2 and N2 components may, to some extent, account for the common negative findings.\n\nThe results demonstrated that alcoholics showed P3 amplitude reductions at almost every scalp site in both modalities, although, at frontal sites, this reduction could, in fact, reflect the influence of age. The P3 amplitude reduction is in accord with the majority of reports (Cohen et al., 1995(Cohen et al., ,1997;;Glenn et al., 1994Glenn et al., ,1996;;Kathmann et al., 1996;Miyazato and Ogura, 1993;Parsons, 1994;Parsons et al., 1990;Pfefferbaum et al., 1987Pfefferbaum et al., ,1991;;Porjesz et al., 1980Porjesz et al., ,1987;;Realmuto et al., 1993). Under most testing conditions, the midline electrodes, especially Pz, were reported to manifest P3 alterations; the present study demonstrated that P3 reductions are more widespread. The robust P3 reduction also has been found in other alcohol-related groups of subjects: namely, children at high risk (Begleiter et al., 1984) and normals following acute ethanol ingestion (Hamon and Camara, 1994). However, the auditory P3 does not always differentiate alcoholics from controls (Hill et al., 1995;Parsons et al. 1990;Steinhauer et al., 1987), even if the two groups were significantly different in familial density of alcoholism, a very important codeterminant in the observed P3 amplitude reduction of alcoholism (Cohen et al.,1995;Pfefferbaum et al., 1991). To date, P3 amplitude reductions have been associated with: (1) acute neurotoxic effects of alcohol (Hamon and Camara 1994;Oscar-Berman, 1987); (2) sober alcoholics with prolonged abstinence (Porjesz and Begleiter, 1985); (3) antecedent of alcoholism (Begleiter et al., 1987); (4) gender (Hill and Steinhauer, 1993;Parsons et al., 1990); (5) familial loading for alcoholism (Benegal et al., 1995;Cohen et al., 1995;Pfefferbaum et al., 1991); (6) neurodevelopmental lag (Hill et al., 1995); and (7) paradigm parameters used to elicit P3, such as sensory modality and task difficulty (Polich et al., 1994), etc. The interactions among these factors may enhance or suppress P3 vulnerability. For example, although Hill et al. (1995) interpreted the discrepancy between their positive findings (reduced P3) in boys at risk and their negative finding (normal P3) in high-risk adult males (who were not the same boys grown up) as a developmental lag, it is also possible that the auditory paradigm, intense familial loading, and the alcohol naive state of the subjects interacted to suppress P3 alterations. After all, our results confirm the vulnerability of P3 amplitude in both the visual and auditory modality to the sober state of alcoholics; it is still unresolved whether it is the predisposition of the alcoholics or it is the persistent chronic neurotoxic effect of alcohol. Furthermore, alcoholics in this group displayed more hemispheric P3 differences among central electrodes (left-smaller-than-right) than controls, indicating that the P3 amplitude aberration in alcoholics is more pronounced in the left compared with the right hemisphere, especially in the auditory modality.\n\nThis latter finding resembles that from Miyazato and Ogura (1993) who reported an auditory P3 reduction only at left centrofrontal sites in alcoholics. However, in contrast to those observations, the P3 deficit described herein had a far greater anterior-posterior extent and involved both left and right hemispheres. Thus, the left-worse-than-right description as applied to the current results refers to a widespread P3 deficit in which the magnitude of the deficit was greater in the left central region than the right.\n\nReduced P3 amplitude as well as hemispheric asymmetry in the magnitude of the deficit also has been documented in schizophrenics (O'Donnell et al., 1999;Potts et al., 1998;Salisbury et al., 1999). It has been proposed that this pattern may reflect abnormalities in the P3 generators located in the temporal lobe as well as anatomic asymmetries in the temporal lobe and/or associated structures. Imaging studies suggest an anatomic basis for the asymmetry in the electrophysiological deficit, with reports of decreased tissue volumes in both the left angular gyrus (Niznikiewicz et al., 2000) and left planum temporale (Hirayasu et al., 2000;Kwon et al., 1999). In contrast, although imaging studies in alcoholics have revealed numerous anatomic deficits (e.g., decreased white matter and gray matter, increased sulcal CSF volumes, and increased ventricles) (Pfefferbaum et al., 1998;Sullivan et al., 1998), they have not documented the asymmetries observed in schizophrenics; possibly, these differences are below the detection threshold for MRI. Given the evidence that alcoholism is characterized by etiologic heterogeneity, it may be that the left-worse-than-right pattern in the P3 deficit describes an alcoholic subtype. In this context, imaging studies might prove valuable in determining whether structural abnormalities underlie the topography of electrophysiological deficit.\n\nIn general, aging reduces P3 amplitude (0.18 uV per year) in a similar way for both auditory and visual modalities (Picton et al., 1984). In this study, the average age of the alcoholic group was approximately 6 years greater than that of the control group. Therefore, the group comparison could be affected by the age difference. Our results revealed that the age effect on P3 amplitude is different for alcoholics and controls (significant age by group effect) only in the frontal region (i.e., the rate of reduction of P3 amplitude with age manifests group differences frontally) but not elsewhere. In contrast, the decreased auditory and visual P3 amplitudes generated in other regions by the alcoholics did not reflect the age difference between the groups. Anderer et al. (1996) demonstrated that in the normal population, the ageamplitude relationship in the frontal region is not as linear as in parietal and occipital regions. This may contribute to the significant age ϫ group interaction observed in the frontal region, but not in other brain regions. The differential effect of age on alcoholics and controls was also observed by Realmuto et al. (1993), who reported that, in controls, there was a significant negative correlation between age and P3 amplitude at both Fz and Pz; in contrast, no correlation was found in alcoholics at Pz. In addition, in the frontal region, the controls had larger P3 responses to visual compared with auditory stimuli; this modality difference was not observed in alcoholics. In the present study, because the alcoholics were generally older than the controls, the significant (controls) versus nonsignificant (alcoholics) modality effect in the frontal region could be caused by the age difference and/or the absence/ presence of alcoholism. To address this question, it would be necessary to obtain separate regression functions for visual P3 amplitude with age and auditory P3 amplitude with age. However, this would require a larger number of subjects than that in the present study.\n\nModality and Task Difficulty. One aspect of this study that may be considered problematic is that it compared responses between an easy, two-stimulus auditory paradigm and a difficult, three-stimulus visual paradigm. Consequently, one may offer that any modality-related difference in P3 is confounded by a difference in task difficulty. Several lines of evidence suggest this difference had little effect on the results.\n\nFirst is the fact that, to accurately assess modality-related differences in P3, one needs to equate the stimuli in each modality. This requires that a cross-modality matching procedure be used with each subject to generate stimulus sets that are subjectively equal along some dimension (e.g., intensity). Moreover, the procedure would need to be repeated for each stimulus category. Whereas it would be time consuming but rather simple for frequent and rare stimuli in a basic oddball paradigm, it would be inordinately difficult, if not impossible, to generate sets of novel stimuli.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, no studies of modality-related differences in P3 have used this degree of experimental rigor.\n\nSecond are the results from a recent review (Porjesz and Begleiter, 1998) that suggest that the effect of task difficulty may be equivocal. The authors reported that identical results have been obtained with tasks at different levels of difficulty. Moreover, some aspects of task difficulty, e.g. discrimination, alter P3 characteristics whereas other aspects, e.g. response selection difficulty do not. The authors also suggested that task difficulty is not necessarily a continuum along which P3 results can be explained.\n\nLast is the observation that, even if the present results were influenced in part by differences between the two paradigms, these differences were common to both groups. In this context, the possible confound still does not diminish our most important findings (i.e., significant within and between groups differences in controls and alcoholics that likely reflect group differences in stimulus processing rather than differences in experimental design).\n\nThe topographic profile analysis for group differences along the far right sagittal plane revealed that the P3 reductions in alcoholics were statistically more pronounced in the posterior compared with the anterior regions (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the P3 amplitude reduction in the central region in alcoholics is more pronounced in the left than in the right hemisphere. Several studies (Anderer et al., 1996;Friedman et al., 1993) have demonstrated that, with advancing age, there is a shift to a relatively more frontally oriented P3 amplitude distribution and therefore a more equal distribution across the scalp. Thus, in alcoholics, their greater age may exaggerate the P3 amplitude difference between anterior and posterior areas (Pfefferbaum et al., 1991). As a consequence, the large amplitude differences between alcoholics and controls at posterior sites become less pronounced anteriorly. However, the exaggerating effect of age does not rule out the intrinsic effect of alcoholism on the differences in the P3 topographic distribution, since neither a 3-way nor 2-way interaction between age and group nor frontal-central-parietal-occipital effect was statistically significant. The sources in the CSD maps of alcoholics seem weaker than those of controls and appeared to describe a modality-specific pattern: alcoholics manifested weaker current density sources mainly in the frontal region in the auditory modality and mainly in the parietal-occipital region in the visual modality (Fig. 8).\n\nIn summary, this study of auditory and visual P3 in alcoholics has both confirmed previous findings and documented new and interesting results. For example, the decreased P3 response over widespread cortical regions has been reported in other studies. However, the results also indicate that the decrease was neither modality nor task specific and suggest that neither factor strongly influenced the deficit. Furthermore, whereas other studies have demonstrated that P3 amplitude is a function of age, this investigation has demonstrated that the relationship differs between alcoholics and controls. Moreover, the difference was not manifested consistently in group comparisons of P3 responses in each region; rather, it appeared to be localized to the frontal region and was not modality specific.\n\nThe analyses of CSD revealed that sources in alcoholics were generally weaker and manifested greater hemispheric asymmetries than those in controls. Thus, it is of interest to determine whether the findings regarding the P3 generators are, in fact, associated with the left-worsethan-right (LWTR) distribution of the P3 deficit. In several previous studies, the LWTR designation has been applied to the topography of the P3 deficit that characterized schizophrenic subjects. Interestingly, there is evidence that, in schizophrenics, the topography of the amplitude decrease may have a structural basis; imaging studies have described anatomic deficits in the left temporal lobe and associated structures. The present investigation is one of very few that has documented the LWTR pattern in a population of alcoholic individuals. Further, the real extent of the deficit was greater than that which had been reported previously. However, in contrast to the findings in schizophrenics, anatomic and/or imaging studies in alcoholics have not yet described well-localized structural deficits that could contribute to both the P3 decrease as well as its topography. It is possible that the present sample of alcoholics comprises an alcoholic subtype defined, in part, by the topography of the P3 deficit. It remains for imaging and related studies to determine whether this subject group is also characterized by specific structural deficits (Desmedt and Chalklin, 1989;Pfefferbaum et al., 1998).\n\n* Data are for the 6 months prior to treatment."
