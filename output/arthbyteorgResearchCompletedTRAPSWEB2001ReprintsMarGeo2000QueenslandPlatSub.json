Previous attempts to analyse tectonic subsidence in this area were hampered by poor core Ž . recovery and dating uncertainties at some of the ODP Ocean Drilling Program Leg 133 sites on the Queensland Plateau, in particular at sites 812 and 814.

However, the tectonic post-rift subsidence history of many passive margins, including the Queensland and Marion plateaus offshore northeast Australia, shows substantial deviations from the expected exponential thermal subsidence. Such deviations can be caused by renewed rifting, elastic deformation or dynamic topography. Renewed rifting on passive margins is rare, as deformation resulting from plate divergence is taken up at the mid-ocean ridge that forms after initial rifting ceases. Elastic deformation has been recognised as an important mechanism modulating passive margin subsidence. It is caused by in-plane forces and depends on the Ž . effective elastic thickness EET of the lithosphere, the magnitude of the applied force, and the pre-exist-Ž . ing lithospheric deflection Karner et al., 1993 . In contrast, the effect of dynamic topography on passive margins is less well documented. This mechanism may cause accelerated subsidence if a passive margin moves over a sinking subducted slab in the mantle, causing negative dynamic topography Ž . Gurnis et al., 1998 . The aim of this paper is to document anomalies in the tectonic subsidence history of the northeastern Australian margin and investigate their causes.\n\nThe Queensland and Marion plateaus were drilled Ž . during Ocean Drilling Program ODP Leg 133. Katz Ž . and Miller 1993 used depth-dependant benthic foraminifer assemblages to reconstruct the palaeobathymetric history of the Queensland and Marion Plateaus, and the Townsville and Queensland Troughs. But, as most benthic foraminiferal faunas encompass a large depth range, the resolution of Katz and Miller's palaeo water depth estimates is poor. Despite this, their work did show evidence of accelerated increases in water depth occurring near 2-3, 6-7 and 13-14 Ma. No suggestions were made as to the causes for these increases in water depth.\n\nIn order to better constrain the timing, pattern, and cause of regional subsidence off northeast Australia, backstripped tectonic subsidence was computed for ODP sites on the Queensland Plateau Ž . Ž . 811r825, 812 and 814 , the Marion Plateau 815 , Ž . and the Queensland Trough 823 . At Queensland Plateau sites 812 and 814, this analysis was impeded by poor core recovery and sediment dating within Miocene sequences. To provide additional chronostratigrpahic information and to reconstruct more complete stratigraphic sections at these ODP sites, we integrated geophysical log data with available bio-and lithostratigraphic information to identify hardground surfaces within the sedimentary sequences. These hardgrounds provided useful chronostratigraphic markers which we correlated to third-order eustatic sea-level lowstands on the Haq et Ž . al. 1987 curve.\n\nThe entire northeast Australian margin is underlain by stretched continental lithosphere, which be-Ž gan rifting in the Early Cretaceous Davies et al., . 1989 .

In the late Cretaceous, rifting in the Coral Sea Basin created numerous continental fragments which are now capped by carbonate platforms, such as the Marion and Queensland Plateaus.

Muller et al.r Marine Geology 162 2000 337-352 ¨339 high-standing structural elements on which the numerous carbonate platforms in the area are located.\n\nThe Queensland Plateau is a submerged carbonate platform whose western and southern margins are bounded by the Queensland Trough and the Ž . Townsville Trough, respectively Fig. 1 . The metasedimentary basement is composed of fault blocks that form a surface which dips to the north-Ž . east towards the Coral Sea basin Mutter, 1977 . The fault blocks on the western one-third of the plateau are increasingly downfaulted to the Queensland trough. At the southern edge of the plateau, the basement gently slopes south to the boundary fault Ž . of the Townsville Trough Davies et al., 1989 . The Marion Plateau is a largely undeformed basement block structured only on its margins. Basement along the northern margin consists of gently dipping ramps that gradually deepen towards the Townsville Trough until a fault is encountered. Normal extensional faults along this northern margin are restricted to the edge of the plateau, and include both downto-basin faults with dips to the NNW and normal faults of opposite polarity which dip beneath the Ž . plateau Symonds et al., 1988 . The eastern margin of the plateau is free of major structural offsets Ž . Mutter and Karner, 1980 and the slope is apparently simple and continuous. Faults along this margin are steeply dipping to vertical and downfault the margin of the plateau into the Cato Trough. The southern part of the plateau is formed by a southeasterly plunging, gently arched basement high. The top of the arch is unstructured and faults are confined to the flanks of the arch and appear to be high-angle down-to-basin normal faults on conventional seismic Ž . data Pigram, 1993 .\n\nThe magnitude of subsidence or uplift in a region depends on the net contributions from sediment and water loadingrunloading and vertical tectonic movements.

The following parameters are required to compute backstripped tectonic subsidence: Ž . a the age of each lithological unit; Ž . b the present depth below sea-level of each unit; Ž . c the porosity-depth curve for each lithology; Ž . d the palaeo water depth at the time of deposition of each unit; Ž . f the eustatic sea-level variations for the time period of interest.\n\nErrors in water depth estimates are included in our models. The uncertainties in the magnitude of Ž . eustatic sea-level variations Fig. 2 result in errors in the calculation of isostatic subsidence caused by water loading, leading to an over-or under-estimation of tectonic subsidence. In order to evaluate these uncertainties, two models of backstripped tectonic subsidence have been generated for each site. The first model does not take into account changes in Ž . eustatic sea-level Fig. 5.1a,2a,3a, and 4a , while the second model incorporates third-order variations in Ž . Ž eustatic sea-level from Haq et al. 1987 Fig. . 5.1b,2b,3a, and 4b . This allows us to estimate the isostatic contribution of the water load due to inferred eustatic sea-level changes, and remove it from the computed tectonic subsidence. Ignoring falling eustatic sea level would result in underestimating tectonic subsidence, and vice versa.\n\nODP Leg 133 drilled 15 holes off northeast Aus-Ž . tralia Fig. 1 .

The Schlumberger dual induction tool DIT-E was used to measure formation resistivity at three Ž different depths of investigation for a more detailed explanation, see ''Explanatory Notes'' chapter in .

Thus, we have relied on these data for our analyses. Ž . Ž . a and 814 b and their correlation with seismic sequences and eustatic sea-level variations from Haq et al. 1987 . The sequence boundaries A, B and C have been tied to third-order eustatic sea-level lowstands, based on a combined analysis of the geophysical logs and Ž . the lithostratigraphy see text for discussion . Muller et al.r Marine Geology 162 2000 337-352 Most sedimentary rocks have high resistivities, whereas their pore fluids are good conductors. The most important factors controlling formation resistivity are porosity, salinity of formation water and the connectivity and tortuosity of the pore channels. Log resistivity data was used to reconstruct the porosity profiles of the drillholes as no direct log porosity measurement was made at most sites. The first empirical relationship between porosity and resistivity Ž . was determined by Archie 1942 :\n\nwhere FF is the formation factor, Ro rock resistivity, Rw resistivity of the pore fluid, and f porosity. The Ž . variable m also called ''Archie m'' is the cementation factor which is dependant on the shape of the particles and is an indication of pore channel geometry. In this calculation, formation water resistivities were assumed to decrease linearly from 0.25 V m at the seafloor to 0.20 V m at 300 mbsf as indicated by conductivity measurements on recovered pore waters Ž . Davies et al., 1991 . A log of Archie m was constructed for sites 812 and 814 using porosities derived from the density log Ž . and FF calculated from the resistivity log Fig. 3 in order to view changes in the character of formation porosity at these sites as compared to those expected for a normal compaction profile. The model of porosity variation with depth used in the backstripping calculations only takes into account exponential porosity reduction due to compaction. Analysis of geophysical logs from sites 812 and 814 show that secondary porosity caused by carbonate dissolution is a major contributor to total porosity resulting in values between 30% and 60% throughout the entire drilled interval. The timing of carbonate dissolution at these sites is unknown and thus diagenetic increases in porosity cannot be incorporated into our porosity-depth models. Thus, high diagenetic porosity at sites 812 and 814 will result in an overestimation of bulk density within the subsidence models. Consequently, a larger proportion of the total subsidence will be attributed to isostatic subsidence caused by sediment loading resulting in an underestimation of tectonic subsidence. Therefore, our tectonic subsidence models are likely to provide minimum estimates.\n\nSediment ages for Leg 133 drillsites studied were primarily established using shipboard and shorebased Ž biostratigraphic datums Davies et al., 1991;Gartner . et al., 1993;Wei and Gartner, 1993   3a and b . In general, hardgrounds were characterized by increased velocity and resistivity and decreased porosity. The above approach provided our best means to tentatively date the sediments in the absence of biostratigraphic datums and suitable core recovery. We use seismic stratigraphy to verify whether our correlations are reasonable in terms of the character of seismic sequences.\n\nThe tectonic subsidence models for Queensland Plateau sites 812 and 814 which do not take into Ž . account eustatic sea-level changes Fig. 5.1a and 2a show a gradually subsiding platform from 21 to 13.7 Ma. At site 814, a subsidence pulse of approximately 50 mrmy is observed between 13.4 and 11.7 Ma Ž . Fig. 5.2b . However, since the model which does . not account for sea-level Fig. 5.1a shows no change in subsidence rate at this time, this event could be entirely an artefact of a eustatic sea-level curve that is not well constrained. A period of rapid subsidence is noted at both sites from about 5-4 Ma to present, Ž . despite falling eustatic sea-levels Fig. 4 . This tectonic subsidence pulse is independent of an inferred eustatic sea-level curve, as it is reflected in both Ž . models Fig. 5.1a,2a,1b and 2b , however, its amplitude is enhanced by about 90 m if the inferred falling eustatic sea-level during the last 5 million years from Ž . Haq et al. 1987 is included.\n\nŽ Both subsidence models for sites 811r825 Fig.\n\n. 5.3a and b show accelerated tectonic subsidence occurring from 13.7-10.3, 9-7 and 3.3 Ma to present. However, within the water depth errors, a model without any changes in subsidence rate between 13.7 and 9 Ma would also fit the data. Tectonic subsidence pulses at site 815 are observed in Ž . both models Fig. 5.4a and b from 8.3-6 and 4 Ma to present. However, due to the large range in palaeo water depth errors, it is also possible that the site has had a simple tectonic subsidence history in which the basement subsided at a constant rate from at least 8.3 Ma to present, as indicated by straight dashed lines on the models. Site 823 provides us with the only record drilled in one of the troughs adjacent to the Queensland Plateau. Because water depths have been relatively deep at this site since approximately 6 Ma, the errors in palaeo water depth estimates are large Ž . ; 800 m . Therefore, we only show tectonic subsidence calculated without eustatic sea-level variations. Despite the large errors for post 6 Ma tectonic subsidence, this site clearly shows high rates of subsidence from 9 Ma to present, amounting to 1300 \" 200 m. Unfortunately, due to the depth of this site since 9 Ma, we cannot resolve any changes in subsidence rates in this time interval.\n\nTable 1 summarises the tectonic subsidence at sites 811r825, 812, 814, 815 and 823, without inferred eustatic sea-level changes, averaged for time intervals which we can well resolve within the water depth errors. The values listed are conservative estimates, as the assumption of falling eustatic sea-level since the late Miocene would increase the modelled subsidence. Our results show that the western and southern margins of the Queensland Plateau have subsided by at least 400-600 m during the last 9 my, whereas the Queensland Trough has subsided by at least 1100 m since 9 Ma.\n\nRenewed rifting as a cause of the observed excess subsidence can be ruled out, as it would have been accompanied by brittle normal faulting. In this case, we would expect to find extensional faults affecting PliocenerPleistocene sediments, which is not ob-Ž served on seismic reflection data Mutter and Karner, 1980;Symonds et al., 1988;Davies et al., 1989; . Pigram, 1993 . The next hypothesis to be tested is: Can the anomalous subsidence observed on the northeastern margin of Australia be accounted for by collision and thrust loading of the Australian Plate in Papua New Guinea? The New Guinea Orogen to the north of the study area was initiated in the middle to Ž . late Oligocene 30-25 Ma when the leading edge of the Australian craton collided with several arc com-Ž plexes, oceanic plateaus and micro-continents Pi-. gram and Davies, 1987 . It is possible that far-field effects of these collisions have been responsible for the anomalous subsidence recorded on the northeastern Australian margin. In the late Miocene, collision of the Melanesian arc caused regional uplift of the northern Papua New Guinea basement from 8 to 5 Ž . Ma Crowhurst et al., 1996 . Later, the compressional deformation migrated south, causing uplift and Ž denudation of the Papuan Fold Belt Crowhurst et . al., 1996 . These events are documented in basement subsidence curves of the Papuan Basin, a convergent margin foreland basin that formed as a result of continental margin loading by the emplacement of a Ž thrust mass Pigram and Symonds, 1991; Haddad . and Watts, in press . The wells Uramu-1, Magobu Island-1, Muabu-1 and Iviri-1 all show accelerated Ž subsidence starting near 20 Ma Haddad and Watts, . in press . Some wells show slowing subsidence rates after foreland basin initiation prior to the latest rapid subsidence pulse that was recorded, starting at about Ž . 10 Ma at Iviri-1 Haddad and Watts, in press , and at 5 Ma at Uramu 1 and Kusa-1 and at 2 Ma at Anchor Ž . Cay Pigram and Symonds, 1991 . Haddad and Watts Ž . in press modelled the evolution of the Papuan foreland basin and found that gravity and well data are matched best by the loading of a broken, elastic Ž . plate with equivalent elastic thickness EET of 40- ¨347 80 km, with some exceptions in eastern Papua New Guinea, where much lower EET's were recorded close to the plate break, which is inferred to be located near the center of the fold and thrust belt.\n\nTo test whether plate flexure due to mountain building in Papua New Guinea could have caused the observed anomalous subsidence northeast of Australia, we use a simple elastic model following Ž . Haddad and Watts in press , that includes a cosineshaped mountain belt 2.5 km high and a half-width Ž . of 150 km the average shape of the thrust load . Half of this mass loads the end of a broken plate Ž . with a constant EET of 40, 60 or 80 km Fig. 6a , Ž . based on the algorithm from Bodine 1981 . In order to investigate the effect of the horizontal force applied to the edge of the Australian Plate we apply a horizontal force of 1013 Nrm, commonly used to test the effects of in-plane stresses on basin evolution Ž . Karner et al., 1993 . We find that the load creates a flexural bulge which extends up to 1000 km away from the load, but at distances larger than 800 km its effect is negligible. If we use an edge force of 2 = 10 12 Nrm for modelling the force acting on the northern edge of the Australian plate, as suggested Ž . by Coblentz et al. 1995 , then the observed far-field effect of the thrust loading is even smaller. Further, all models create late Tertiary uplift on the northeast Australian margin, not subsidence as observed. Clearly, this model cannot account for our observations. Its failure may be the result of neglecting the pre-existing flexural deflection and realistic lateral variations in EET along the transect from Papua New Guinea to the Marion Plateau. Karner et al. Ž . 1993 show an example of a composite passive margin, i.e., a margin separated from the continent by a rift-basin, similar to the geometry of the Queensland Plateau and Trough, and point out that in such a case the flexural reaction to renewed in-plane . Ž . Ž 13 1995 than in the model of Karner et al. 1993 10 . Nrm . Moreover, the force is applied obliquely, rather than normal to the margin. Therefore, we conclude that the modulation of a pre-existing passive margin flexural deflection alone cannot account for our observations.\n\nAnother possibility is that lateral variations of the EET on the northeast Australian margin may be larger than assumed in the model of Karner et al. Ž . 1993 . In order to qualitatively investigate this possibility, we create another simple model similar to that shown in Fig. 6a, but including a variable EET Ž . Ž . Fig. 6b . Zuber et al. 1989 showed that the EET of onshore northeastern Australia is about 25 km based on the coherence of Bouguer gravity anomalies and topography. In the absence of any estimates for the EET of the Queensland and Marion plateaus, we assume that their EET equals 25 km, which we regard as a maximum estimate. This assumption is supported by Leg 133 drilling, which showed that the Queensland Plateau metasedimentary basement is Ž . identical to that found onshore Feary et al., 1993 . Further, we assume that the EET underlying the Townsville and Queensland troughs may be reduced Ž . us evaluate the potential effect of eustatic variations on tectonic subsidence models. For instance, the first model for site 814 a shows a Ž . gently subsiding platform until about 5 Ma, whereas the second model, including eustacy b , shows a tectonic subsidence pulse between 14 and 12 Ma. Therefore, the latter may be entirely due to the input of an ill-constrained eustatic sea-level curve.\n\n. to 5 km a minimum estimate . By using EETs of 40, 60, and 80 km for the northernmost portion of the Australian plate edge, following Haddad and Watts Ž . Ž in press , we create a composite EET-profile Fig.\n\n. 6c . We then apply the same thrust load and in-plane force as in Fig. 6a. By assuming such extreme variations in EET and a relatively large in-plane force, we create subsidence no larger than 200 m over our model basin, while uplift of the basin Ž . shoulders is predicted Fig. 6b . This is discrepant with our observations, as we observe much larger amounts of tectonic subsidence both in the Queensland Trough and on the Queensland and Marion plateaus. We thus reject our first hypothesis and conclude that neither the model of Karner et al.\n\n. 1993 nor the simple flexural models presented here can account for the unusually large magnitude of subsidence observed. In other words, the observed subsidence is not a simple consequence of collision and thrust loading in Papua New Guinea alone. The only other mechanism available to cause accelerated subsidence of the northeastern margin of Australia is dynamic boundary topography. Could the rapid Tertiary northward motion of Australia have caused the overriding of a zone of dynamic downwelling, such as that caused by a slab descending in the mantle? In this case, we would expect to see a zone of positive velocity anomalies in the upper mantle underlying the northeastern margin of Australia. Indeed, the high-resolution upper mantle shear wave tomography model by van der Hilst et al. Ž . 1998 displays a NNW-SSE trending band of anomalously high velocities in the upper mantle at depths of 300 km in Queensland, landward of the southern Queensland and Marion plateaus. An upper mantle shear wave tomography model by Zhang and Ž . Tanimoto 1993 confirms that this band of high velocities extends down to 500 km and may stretch from the Queensland Plateau to Indonesia. These anomalies most likely reflect subducted slab material originating from Oligocene-Eocene subduction north of Papua New Guinea, as outlined by Crowhurst et Ž . al. 1996 . By using the absolute plate motion model Ž . of Muller et al. 1993 , it can be shown that the mantle now underlying the Queensland Plateau would have been located about 2000 km farther north relative to the Australian Plate in the late Eocene, where rapid convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates initiated subduction, creating the Caroline back-arc basin, until subduction stopped and Ž migrated northward in the late Oligocene Crowhurst . et al., 1996 . It is plausible, therefore, that the highvelocity band in the lower mantle seen in tomo-Ž . Ž . graphic images of van der Hilst et al. 1998 Fig. 8\n\n. and Zhang and Tanimoto 1993 corresponds to sinking slab material subducted north of Papua New Guinea. The observed post 9 Ma tectonic subsidence of the Queensland and Marion plateaus and the Queensland Trough is likely caused by dynamic surface topography due to Australia's northeastern margin overriding this slab burial ground. In this scenario, the lateral differences in tectonic subsidence would have to be accounted for by the effect of in-plane compressive forces originating from the northern Australian plate boundary. A quantitative model for this flexural response would require detailed knowledge of the rifting history of this margin, which is currently not available. Subsidence rates are about 145 \" 20 mmryr since 9 Ma in the Queens-land Trough, 70 \" 20 mmryr on the western Queensland Plateau since 9 Ma, 100 \" 5 mmryr on the southern Queensland Plateau and 130 \" 10 Ž . mmryr on the Marion Plateau. Gurnis 1992 showed that dynamic subsidence rates resulting from slab subduction can exceed 100 mmryr. This shows that it is plausible to attribute the observed subsidence rates on the northeast Australian margin to the overriding of a sinking slab. It is important to point out that the observed rates of late Tertiary tectonic subsidence on the Queensland and Marion plateaus are much slower than those of third-order sea-level changes, and can thus be differentiated from glacialeustasy.\n\nOur model also implies that areas north of the Queensland Plateau, such as the Papuan Basin, should have experienced anomalous subsidence earlier than the Queensland Plateau, when they were located above the sinking slab. Australia's absolute plate motion rate with respect to the hotspot frame was between 60 and 80 mmryr during the last 10 my Ž . Muller et al., 1993 . This implies that the Papuan Basin was located above the sinking slab about 10 million years before the Queensland Plateau and Trough started overriding it. Hence, the onset of accelerated subsidence in the Papuan Basin at 20 Ma Ž . Haddad and Watts, in press may be partly due to dynamic topography. However, it may be impossible to separate this effect from subsidence due to foreland basin formation. Recently, rapid rates of late Ž . Tertiary 28-17 Ma subsidence rates of 130 \" 30 mmryr have also been documented in the Taranaki Ž . Basin in New Zealand Stern and Holt, 1994 . In analogy with northeastern Australia, a flexural foreland basin model fails to account for the spatial extent of the ''platform subsidence'', pointing to Ž mantle convection as its source Stern and Holt, . Ž . 1994 . Further, Gurnis et al. 1998 showed that the mid-Cretaceous flooding of eastern Australia, followed by sub-aerial exposure during a global sealevel high, can be accounted for by eastern Australia's overriding of a sinking slab. These results, together with the work reported here, suggest that dynamic topography induced by sinking slabs can be recognised both in intra-continental basins and passive margins, and that subsidence data can provide valuable clues for differentiating between different causes of relative sea-level changes.\n\nAn integration of geophysical log analysis with biostratigraphic, lithological and seismic data has allowed us to reconstruct the tectonic subsidence history of parts of the Queensland and Marion plateaus. Even though rapid increases in water depth Ž during the Neogene were noted before Katz and . Miller, 1993 , our analysis quantifies these changes in water depth with respect to sedimentary basement, and evaluates the results in terms of eustatic vs. tectonic causes. All sites show ''foreland-basin type'' subsidence rates of up to 145 mrmy, even though this area is located about 800 km away from the Papuan foreland basin to the north, and about 1000 km away from the thrust load which caused the Papuan Basin to form. Results of our analysis, assuming constant eustatic sea-level, show post 9 Ma subsidence of 1300 \" 200 m in the Queensland Trough, 650 \" 200 m on the western margin of the Queensland Plateau, post 5 Ma subsidence of 500 \" 30 m on its southern margin, and 660 \" 50 m on the northern margin of the Marion Plateau. These are minimum subsidence estimates, as long-term eustatic sea-level is assumed to have fallen during this time Ž . period Haq et al., 1987 . A conventional foreland-basin model, in which a foreland basin forms in front of an advancing thrust sheet, cannot explain the observed tectonic subsidence, even if we include compressional in-plane forces and variations in equivalent elastic plate thick-Ž . ness. A published model Karner et al., 1993 for simulating the flexural response to in-plane forces of a margin with an overall structure similar to that given by the Queensland Plateau and Trough also fails to account for the observed large amplitudes of passive margin subsidence.\n\nWe propose that the observed post 9 Ma tectonic subsidence of the Queensland and Marion plateaus and the Queensland Trough is largely caused by dynamic surface topography due to Australia's northeastern margin overriding a slab burial ground, modulated by flexural deformation resulting from collision north of Australia. Shear wave tomography Ž . Zhang and Tanimoto, 1993 shows a NNW-SSE trending band of anomalously high velocities in the upper mantle at depths between 300 and 500 km, stretching from the Queensland Plateau to Indonesia.\n\nTaking into account the absolute plate motion history of Australia and the subduction history north of Papua New Guinea, we believe that a band of observed positive shear-wave anomalies in the upper mantle stretching from the Queensland Plateau to Indonesia likely reflects subducted slab material originating from Oligocene-Eocene subduction north of the Caroline back-arc basin. The resulting basement subsidence has probably been modulated by flexural deformation resulting from collision north of Australia, even though this effect cannot be quantified in the absence of detailed knowledge of the rifting history of the margin. The observed rates of tectonic subsidence are much slower than those of third-order sea-level changes. This suggests that neither the waxing and waning of dynamic surface topography nor variations in in-plane forces have produced fluctuations in relative sea-level in this area that are similar in frequency to third-order eustatic sea-level changes. In the future, observations from basins and platforms should provide valuable constraints on mantle convection models and help to distinguish between different causes of relative sealevel changes."
