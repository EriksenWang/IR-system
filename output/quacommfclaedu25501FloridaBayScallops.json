Florida's Nature Coast which includes Crystal River, very much needs new commercial ventures for displaced fishermen. This project has all the elements for success since it includes the cooperation of Sea Grant Faculty with the local community. The project will benefit the local economy of Citrus County through the involvement of fishermen with scallop aquaculture and a specialized fishery product.\nThe conclusions and opinions expressed in the report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the grantors.",
    "full_text": "Scallops have a high market value and are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world where either the entire meat is consumed or only the large adductor muscle is consumed. Over 35 species of scallops are harvested worldwide but wild stocks in many areas have declined either because of overfishing or because of natural or man-induced environmental changes. One species, the American bay scallop (Argopecten irradians[ is a commercially important species along the east coast of the United States but commercial fishing of wild stocks of the bay scallops is presently almost non-existent with harvests in New York alone declining from 500,300 lbs. of meats in 1982 to only 300 lbs. in 1988 (Wenczel, et aI., 1992). The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission has banned the commercial harvest of the species from wild stocks in Florida and no previous attempts have been made to examine the aquaculture potential of the species in Florida.\n\nCommercial aquaculture ventures have been started in the United States in Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts but until recently economic success with the species has been less apparent because the shucked adductor muscle meats of domestically grown scallops can't economically compete with the imported American bay scallop meats from China. However, in the past five years, a market has been created in the northeastern United States and Virginia (Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994) for the whole, unshucked product like clams and oysters. This new product is marketed at a premium price as a specialty item and local demand has exceeded production, making the economics of domestic aquaculture feasible (Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994).\n\nThe overall goal of this study was to develop a new fishery resource product through open-water aquaculture for the west coast of Florida that would compete as a non-traditional product through market development. Specific objectives were as follows: I. To grow a minimum of 50, 000 juvenile scallops to a minimum market size of 40 mm in a cage and float system in the off-shore waters of Crystal River, Florida. 2. To determine the growth rate, survival, and time to market size for the individuals in this system and area to other similar projects like Virginia. 3. To introduce local fishermen and the aquaculture students at Crystal River High School to the hatchery, nursery, and grow-out techniques. 4. To determine the economic and financial characteristics of bay scallop culture in Florida and assess the sensitivity of projected costs and earnings to changes in key technical, managerial, and market related parameters. 5. To determine the market acceptability and necessary marketing strategy for whole bay scallop product in Florida.\n\nThe bay scallop, Argopecten irradians (Lamarck), occurs in the shallow estuarine habitats along the east coast of the United states from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Texas (Clarke, 1965). Three subspecies have been described based upon shell morphometries (Waller, 1969). The northern subspecies, Argopecten irradians irradians, extends from Cape Cod to approximately New Jersey and Maryland where it may hybridize with the southern bay scallop, Argopecten irradians concentricus (Clarke, 1965). Harvestable populations of the southern bay scallop become discontinuous beginning about North Carolina. It is absent along the Georgia coast (Walker et al., 1991) and from the East Coast of Florida (unpub data). It reappears on the southwest coast of Florida where it again continues north along the West Coast. Although not common, the southern subspecies reportedly is found as far west as Louisiana (Waller, 1969;Broom, 1976). The third subspecies, Argopecten irradians amplicostatus, occurs from Galveston to Laguna Madre, Texas (Waller, 1969). The degree to which these subspecies are physiologically different is not well understood (Bricelj et aI., 1987) but Blake, et al. (1995) have shown that there are significant genetic differences.. Life History of the Florida Bay Scallop Bay scallops are functional hermaphrodites which reproduce essentially once during their 12-24 month life span. Spawning is largely catastrophic, although the northern populations are more synchronous than the Florida subspecies (Barber and Blake, 1991). On the West Coast of Florida spawning begins in early August in the north (Sastry, 1961) and October in the south (Barber and Blake, 1983).\n\nThe planktonic larval stage of the Florida subspecies lasts 12-14 days (Sastry, 1965), and it is during this planktonic stage that the larval distribution and eventual recruitment may be controlled by the hydrodynamics of the estuary (Eckman, 1987). As the larvae metamorphose, the prodissoconchs (190 urn) typically attach to blades of Thalassia. Growth during the winter is slow but by April scallops of 20-25 mm can be seen on the seagrass (Barber and Blake, 1983). By May scallops become unattached and settle to the bottom at which time growth becomes rapid. Scallops of 40-50 mm occur in July and may reach 60 mm by December (approximately 15 months of age). Growth is continuous in the Florida subspecies even at 33°C, only 2°C below the upper lethal temperature of the adults (Sastry, 1961). Natural mortality after 12 months of age is high due to senescence, and only a few survive into the winter months oftheir second year.\n\nThe reproductive cycle ofthe species is well-understood (Sastry, 1963(Sastry, , 1966(Sastry, , 1968;;Blake and Sastry, 1979;Barber and Blake, 1981, 1983, 1985). A complex relationship exists between a successful reproductive cycle and environmental factors, mainly food and temperature. A minimum threshold temperature and an abundance of food are required to initiate gametogenesis during the spring of the year. Cytoplasmic growth of oocytes in the Florida subspecies near Tampa Bay begins in June and July and requires continuation of adequate food and a water temperature of approximately 28°C (Barber and Blake, 1983). Spawning in the fall usually occurs with a rapid drop in water temperatures, although any environmental shock may trigger spawning. If water temperature and food supply are inadequate early in the reproductive cycle, then oocytes either stop developing and are resorbed or the mature ova become necrotic and any spawning event produces a large amount of non-viable ova. The latter may occur even though the gonadal tissue of the scallop may appear \"ripe\" macroscopically (Blake and Sastry, 1979).\n\nThe high market value of bay scallops combined with rapid growth and short life span of the species has led to the development and refinement of hatchery, nursery, and grow-out techniques (Castagna and Duggan, 1971;Castagna, 1975;Rhodes and Widman, 1980;Mann and Taylor, 1981;Karney, 1991;Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994;Lu and Blake, 1996). Using the information about the natural reproductive cycle investigators have used either artificial conditioning and various stimuli to spawn adults for larval production in a hatchery or relied upon the harvest of reproductively mature adults from the natural environment for spawning stock.\n\nEmbryonic and larval stages of marine invertebrates are often the most sensitive to the environmental conditions and extreme mortality of the embryos and larvae if a strict environment is not maintained in a hatchery. Temperature, salinity, and food supply appear to be the most important environmental variables regulating the growth and reproduction of the adults as well as the survival and growth ofthe embryos and larvae. Tettelbach and Rhodes (1981) extensively studied the combined effects of temperature and salinity on the development of embryos and survival and growth of the larvae of the northern bay scallop, A. irradians irradians. Only embryos cultured at 20°C-25 %0 and 25°C-25%0 showed a greater than 70% normal development. At salinities greater than or lesser than 25%0, normal development declined markedly. Larval survival ofthis northern subspecies for 2-5 days after fertilization occurred over a much wider temperature-salinity range with the optimal combination being 18.7°C and 28.1%0. Maximal larval survival at time of settlement occurred at 20°C-25 %0. Lu (1996) has shown that this same temperature and salinity combination is optimum for the Florida bay scallop larvae and juveniles and that maximum growth of Florida bay scallop larvae and juveniles occurs when a food supply of Isochrysis galbanais maintained at a density of 10-20 cells per ml of culture.\n\nA number of different techniques have been used in hatcheries to maintain larvae and early juveniles. These techniques have included static, aerated water tanks (Castagna and Duggan, 1971;Castagna, 1975;Karney, 1991;Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994;Lu and Blake, 1996) for early larval development. Sieves suspended in down-flowing aerated conicals (Karney, 1991), raceways or troughs fitted with inserts (Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994), and plastic strips suspended in aerated tanks (Lu and Blake, 1996) have been used for pediveliger and post-set animals. Flow-through upwelling systems (Oesterling and DuPaul, 1994) and nylon-meshed bags suspended in the natural environment (Lu and Blake, 1996) are two ofthe more commonly employed techniques for the nursery of early juveniles from 1-8 mm.\n\nFor grow-out, Castagna and Duggan (1971) used large pens in order to demonstrate that a marketsized scallop could be attained in 5-7 months. Early releases ofjuvenile scallops into the natural environment for commercial harvest proved unsuccessful due to heavy predation (Morgan, et aI., 1980). Rhodes andWidman (1980,1984) utilized Japanese pearl nets and lantern nets to determine the optimum scallop density for maximurn growth in Long Island Sound. Oesterling and DuPaul (1994) used polyethylene trays or plastic mesh cages placed directly on the bottom, placed on cinder blocks, or suspended in the water column on a rack system to demonstrate an optimum density of about 500-800 scallops per square meter for attaining a market-size scallop of 40mm in 7 months. More recently Oesterling (pers. com.) has employed a floating pen system to suspend the plastic cages in the water column.\n\nHeavy mortalities can occur at all three points in the aquaculture process. Pathogens associated with scallop diseases have been reviewed by Leibovitz, et al.( 1984). Pathogenic Pseudomonas can bloom on the solid surfaces of culture vessels and kill larvae or early juveniles but can be minimized with regular cleaning and water changes (Karney, 1991). In the nursery and grow-out stages fouling of the nets or cages can reduce flow rates which leads to reduced growth and increased mortality but this can also be minimized with frequent cleaning (Karney, 1991). In the final stages of grow-out, especially during the summer, mortality can occur for unknown reasons (Oesterling, pers. com.;Lu and Blake, 1996) although fouling of the shells by tunicates, barnacles and oysters may be one of the primary causes but frequent cleaning of the shells to decrease the degree of fouling may also lead to mortality.\n\nThe best success with the aquaculture of the species has been in China where in 1982, 26 individuals ofArgopecten irradians irradians transplanted from the United states were spawned successfully (Fusui Zhang, Pers. Comm.). Using techniques largely developed in the U.S., the annual bay scallop production in China steadily increased to over 50,000 tons live weight in 1988. The shucked muscles are imported into the U.S. at $2.00/1b (Zhang, 1995). This success can be partially attributed to the low cost of abundant labor as well as to the legal utilization of the total marine habitat.\n\nJuvenile scallops (150,000) measuring 17-20 mm in shell height were provided for growout in June 1997 and June 1998 by the scallop hatchery at the University of South Florida. The hatchery used the following protocol to produce these juveniles.\n\nAdult scallops nearing reproductive maturity in late summer, 1996 and 1997 were collected from the wild population of the Florida subspecies in the vicinity of Crystal River, Florida. These scallops were maintained in the seawater system at the University of South Florida at a salinity of24-30 %0 and a temperature of28-30°C. Their daily diet was supplemented with 200 ml oflsochrysis galbana per individual until they were brought to reproductive maturity. Algal cultures contained 1-4 million cells per ml (Castagna and Manzi, 1989). Scallops were allowed to spawn naturally on a seawater table containing 25 %0 water at 20-23 0c. Approximately 3 million fertilized eggs were placed in a 500 liter fiberglass tank containing filtered, that had been sterilized by UV. The seawater was maintained at 25°C and 25%0\n\nThe embryos were allowed to develop unfed for 48 hr, by which time most D-shaped larvae 6 developed. After 48 hours the D-shaped larvae were fed the unicellular algae lsochrysis galbana (10 cells/ml) at a rate of 30000 cells per ml of larval culture per day after each water change over a 6-8 hr period. The seawater was changed in the amount of 2/3 of the total volume per day. Development in the hatchery of the Florida subspecies to the pediveliger averages 8-10 days (Lu and Blake, 1996).\n\nAfter 8 days, pieces of black plastic ribbon were suspended in the tanks as a substrate for settlement after 10-14 days. The settled spat were maintained as above for an additional 30 days at which time they were brushed off the black ribbon into 200 micron mesh nylon bags. Each bag contained between 10 and IS thousand spat. The bags were suspended from the dock at the University of South Florida.\n\nFifty scallops from one of the bags were periodically measured for shell height to the nearest 0.1 mm. When the scallops exceeded 2 mm, an estimate was made of mortality by removing empty shells that were not attached to the sides of the bag.\n\nIn 1997 when the scallops reached 17-20 mm, they were transferred to Crystal River and some of the scallop were placed in 12 mm off-bottom-cages on racks. The bottom rack system was constructed of 0.5 in reinforcing bar and anchored to the bottom. The racks extended approximately 1.0 m off the bottom and each rack held 9 cages. A total of three racks were used although 2 ofthe racks were lost to shrimp trawlers in 1997. Other scallops were placed directly on the bottom in 12 mm plastic mesh cages. When they exceeded 25 mm, some of the scallops were transferred to 14 gauge plastic coated wire cages of either 0.5 inch mesh or 1 inch mesh at a density of 200-600 per m 2 .\n\nIn April 1998 an aluminum raft-pen system was constructed by the Withlacoochee Technical Institute (Plate I). The raft measures about 8 meters by 8 meters and the extruded aluminum pen extends one meter below the surface. The raft is permanently moored on 6 pilings in 5 meters of water 5 miles off Crystal River (Figure I) on a 2 acre educational lease awarded by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to Citrus County, Florida. Plastic coated wire mesh cages (13 mm) containing 300 scallops per m 2 were placed inside the pen. The pen will hold approximately 60 thousand caged scallops through growout. Fifty scallops from a selected cage were periodically measured for shell height to the nearest O. I mm, the number of empty shells were counted, and the degree (low, moderate, heavy) of shell fouling was determined.\n\nCRYSTAL BAY ~\\f (fF igure 1. Location of2 acre lease Plate 1. Raft-Pen system for scallop aquaculture\n\nWhen the scallops reached commercial size in September and October, they were harvested and processed (cleaned, packaged, and refrigerated) at the Shrimp Landing of Crystal River. This product was then used as part of the marketing study in Florida (Attachment I). Determination of market acceptability and development of appropriate marketing strategies for whole bay scallops was achieved through a trade survey, a restaurant sales test, and consumer evaluations of several product forms. Because whole bay scallops are currently marketed in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia through upscale restaurants, managers and chefs of these outlets were identified and interviewed by telephone. These interviews were structured to provide a better understanding of marketing strategies used to establish bay scallops as a successful menu item. Particular emphasis was placed on product forms served, pricing strategy, and educational and promotional activities used.\n\nA second marketing research element was a restaurant sales test. Scallops produced in meeting objectives 1-3 of this proposal were made available to four upscale, white tablecloth restaurants within the Crystal River marketing region. Restaurants received the scallops at no charge in exchange for their participation in the study. Managers and chefs were provided with cooking information, serving suggestions and marketing suggestions related to serving sizes, price, and menu information. Investigators provided on-site training to managers, chefs, and their wait staffs prior to the product introduction.\n\nInvestigators provided on-site training to managers, chefs, and their wait staffs prior to the product introduction.\n\nConsumer product evaluations were obtained from restaurant patrons buying whole bay scallops. Restaurant patrons were asked by wait staffto complete a brief questionnaire which obtained product evaluations and repurchase intentions. Socio-demographic data was obtained from each participant. Data from the consumer product evaluations were analyzed using several statistical techniques as appropriate, including tabular analysis (contingency tables, Chi-square analyses) and logit analysis. The marketing portion ofthe report is described in detail in Attachment I.\n\nThe various inputs utilized in the experimental culture process were monitored carefully. Data describing operating inputs such as seed, labor, utilities, and repairs to nets, racks and floating pens was collected. Initial capital equipment and replacement requirements were estimated. Given that a typical commercial operation in Florida does not exist, a cost engineering approach was utilized. This technique is commonly applied to such analyses when a typical production does not exist. This method allowed the estimation of costs and earnings for a hypothetical bay scallop culture operation in Florida. Profitability, cost per scallop, and break-even levels of production was determined. Selected technical, management and market parameters were then varied across reasonable ranges to determine how sensitive profits are to these changes.\n\nThe findings are presented in the form of a set of pro-forma financial statements. Typical financial statements were produced, such as cash flow, income, balance, and enterprise budgets. In addition, a capital investment and replacement schedule was constructed for each phase ofthe culture process. The economic evaluation is described in Attachment II.\n\nAdult scallops from the Crystal River population were used for spawning for both years in the shellfish hatchery at the University of South Florida on Bayboro Harbor in St. Petersburg. In 1996, a total of 40,000 juvenile scallops were produced in the hatchery and nursery for grow-out in Crystal River in 1997. In 1997 another 30,000 were produced. Growth rates for these two years from the time they were placed in the nursery in October-November to June were very similar as shown in Table 1. By June of both years the juvenile scallops had reached a mean shell height of 17-18 mm (Figure 2) with an overall growth rate of about 2.1 mm/month. In 1996-1997 cumulative mortality (Table 1) for nursery scallops in Bayboro Harbor was 10.3 % by June but in 1997-1998 cumulative mortality for the same time period was 34.7% (Table 2). Record rainfall occurred on the west coast of Florida during the fall and winter of 1997-1998 and salinities in Bayboro Harbor were under 10 ppt during much of the period. Scallops normally can not tolerate salinities below 20 ppt for extended periods and the low salinities were a contributing factor in the high mortality.\n\nIn 1997 bay scallops placed off Crystal River (Table 3) grew from a mean of 22.4 mm in June to a mean of 40.0 mm by October 30 (Figure 3) with an additional cumulative mortality of 40.0 %. In 1998 (Table 4) a similar growth was observed during the same time period (Figure 3) while the mortality was reduced to 22.5 %.   45-r------------------------------,-70 Growth and mortality were highly variable depending upon the type of cage used, the density of the scallops in the cages and the degree of fouling that occurred. In 1997 scallops were placed in 12 mm obc's and 25 mm wire cages with densities ranging from 200-600 m 2 . Optimum density for maximum growth appears to be about 250-300 m 2 . The large diameter obc's and wire cages are prone to attack by stone crabs which can easily cut through the large diameter plastic webbing and even bend the 16 gauge wire of the 25 mm cages. A large mortality occurred in some of these cages as a result of stone crab predation. This was alleviated in 1998 when 12 mm wire cages were employed in both the raft-pen system and on the bottom.\n\nFouling represents a serious problem in using caged scallops for growout. Main fouling organisms found on scallop were barnacles, oyster spat, tunicates and polychaete worms. The most extensive fouling started in May and became heavy throughout the whole summer (Plate 2). A scallop cage of about 10 pounds may be 30-50 pounds injust one month, mainly due to the growth oftunicates and oysters on both the scallops and cages. Scallop cages were cleaned or replaced every 3-4 weeks during the summer.\n\nFouling organisms affect the scallops in several other ways than just competing for space and food. Tunicates grow very fast. It was often seen that one tunicate can bind several scallops together, and some scallops were smothered. Oysters do the same; they outgrow scallops and often seal the scallop valves, thus either smothering the scallops or making it impossible for them to close their shells. Polychaete worms are common borers of scallop shells (Blake and Evans, 1973). They penetrate shells and produce black blisters in the inner shells of the scallops. In this study, one hundred percent of the live scallops were bearing such worms and blisters in later summer, coincident with the period of high mortality ofthe scallops. It seems that the heavy infection of polychaete worms and the blisters they produced contributed to slowed growth and mortality. The degree of fouling and possible fouling reduction techniques must be a primary consideration for any scallop aquaculture venture involving caged scallops.\n\nIn November, 1998 a scallop aquaculture training program was initiated in cooperation with the Withlacoochee Technical Institute of The Citrus County School System. Fourteen fishermen displaced by the fishing net ban qualified for the course. The course (attachment III) includes lectures on biology, growout techniques; marketing and expected net profits, and lease availability. Each fisherman was provided with the necessary equipment to grow 2000 scallops which were provided by the USF scallop hatchery. The program will continue through the summer of 1999.\n\nSee Attachment r.\n\nEconomic Evaluation See Attachment II. Tettelbach, S.T. and E.W. Rhodes. 1981.

Supply has been inadequate to meet demand in these areas.\n\nIntensive harvesting and environmental pollution over the last 20 years have resulted in the decline of bay scallops in local Florida estuaries. As a result of this decline, the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission banned commercial harvest of the species and limited recreational harvest to areas north of the Suwannee River.\n\nThe Shellfish Biology Laboratory at the University of South Florida has developed techniques for growing the Florida Bay Scallop by aquacultural methods. Research indicates that commercial production may be feasible in locales with satisfactory water quality.\n\nWhile American consumers traditionally enjoy eating the white fleshed, succulent adductor muscle of scallops, the small size of this muscle in Florida bay scallops makes aquaculture production for the muscle only infeasible.\n\nAn in-restaurant survey carried out during the peak scallop season of September and October of both 1997 and 1998 was utilized to determine consumer acceptance. During both seasons, scallops used in the study were relatively small, ranging in size from 1\"-1_\" (25-35mm) in diameter.\n\nFour local moderately upscale restaurants participated in the study. These restaurants are well known for seafood specialties, but do not serve seafood exclusively. Professional chefs prepared the product and promoted it as a menu special.\n\nConsumers rated specific product attributes of professionally prepared whole bay scallops. In addition, the consumers were asked if they would purchase the product again at the same price.\n\nIn addition to the restaurant patrons, a group of citizens participating in a community fund raising event were asked to evaluate the whole bay scallops. The results from this sample were not analyzed with the restaurant patrons due to the fact that their demographics were not comparable, they did not purchase the product as a separate menu item, and they were served undersized, late season specimens that were somewhat inferior to those served in the restaurants.\n\nSurvey results indicated that the product was very well received. Appearance, taste, texture, value and overall satisfaction generally received very good ratings. Taste received the highest ratings while value received the lowest. Written comments indicated that the value was rated lower because of the small size of the scallops.\n\nThere seemed to be little apprehension regarding eating the whole bay scallop among survey participants. However, the chefs indicated that local residents and older people that were more likely to be familiar with the muscle-only scallop were not well represented among survey respondents because the chefs felt these people avoided the whole scallop. They would have likely rated their hesitation to purchase the product more highly.\n\n• • • • Eighty-seven percent of the restaurant patrons indicated that they would purchase the product again at the same price, indicating a high degree of acceptance of the product.\n\nPromotional efforts emphasizing the \"locally-grown,\" \"environmentally friendly\" \"aquacultured\" product aspects can be utilized by restaurants serving whole bay scallops. Menu specials, recommendations by chefs or serving staff and table-tent style advertising can be effective marketing techniques.\n\nAlthough consumer evaluations were generally positive, several product attributes need to be improved. Consumers' and chefs' perceptions of value could be improved by providing larger sized scallops, about I Y2 \"-1 % \"(35-45mm) in diameter. Further, the chefs also expressed a preference for scallops with cleaner shells; many of the scallops had heavily fouled shells, which were difficult or impossible to clean.\n\nFinally, commercial market development will require stable, reliable supplies of scallops and bi-weekly deliveries because of the product's limited shelf life.\n\nMore than 35 species of scallops are harvested world wide and many of these species are the focus of intense aquaculture. The American bay scallop has been one species that has been aquacultured in China and the meats enter the US market as a relatively inexpensive frozen product. However, in several places in New England, New York and Virginia, the species is now cultured and sold whole in the shell as a specialty product. Remarkably, market demand has exceeded production.\n\nIntensive harvesting and environmental pollution over the last 20 years have resulted in the decline of bay scallops in local Florida estuaries. As a result of this decline, the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission banned scallop harvest for recreation south of the Suwannee River and totally banned the commercial harvest of the species from wild stocks. Since 1990, the Shellfish Biology Laboratory at the University of South Florida has developed the techniques for growing the Florida Bay Scallop for restoration of the species for recreational purposes. Bay scallop aquaculture research indicates that commercial production may be feasible in locales with satisfactory water quality.\n\nTraditionally, American consumers have only eaten the white fleshed, succulent adductor muscle of scallops. However, the small size ofthis muscle in Florida bay scallops makes aquaculture production for the muscle only economically impractical. The successful development of commercial culture of bay scallops in Florida is therefore not only dependent on a successful culturing process, but on the marketability of the whole bay scallop. Further, a new specialty product such as whole bay scallops must have a marketing strategy for timely delivery of desired quantities of the product to the retail market.\n\nProduct acceptability and overall market potential of the product requires evaluation. This study has been undertaken to determine consumer acceptance of the whole bay scallop produced under local conditions.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine market acceptability and marketing strategies for whole bay scallops produced in aquacultural environments in Florida. Specific objectives included I) determining how consumers rate specific product attributes of Florida whole bay scallops including appearance, taste, texture, value and overall satisfaction with the product when prepared by professional chefs in an upscale restaurant setting, 2) measuring consumers' reactions to the thought of eating a whole bay scallop, and 3) determining if consumers were satisfied enough with the product to purchase it again.\n\nDuring the period of June 16-18, 1997, eight chefs representing six upscale restaurants in the Williamsburg/YorktownNirginia Beach, Virginia areas were interviewed. All eight chefs had participated in a pilot marketing program for cultured whole bay scallops initiated several years earlier by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS), College of William & Mary. Most were general menu, white tablecloth restaurants that typically offered several seafood appetizers and entrees. However, two were upscale seafood specialty restaurants.\n\nThe general marketing environment in the Williamsburg/YorktownNirginiaBeach areas of Virginia shares many of the same attributes as north central Florida which make them both positive marketing environments for seafood products. Tourism, mild climates, beaches, and a reputation for abundant seafood make the two markets comparable in many ways. Because ofthese similarities, it was anticipated that the Virginia chefs' experiences and suggestions for marketing acquacultured scallops could be readily adapted by many north central Florida restaurants.\n\nInsight gained from the Virginia chefs' interviews was used to identify restaurants in North Florida with a high probability of successful marketing of whole bay scallops. In addition, comments regarding successful preparation techniques from the Virginia chefs were relayed to the participating Florida chefs to aid with their preparation decisions.\n\nFour upscale, white tablecloth restaurants in North Florida, known for their excellent seafood items, were willing to prepare whole bay scallops for the in-restaurant consumer evaluation survey. These restaurants, while known for excellent seafood, were not exclusively seafood restaurants. During September and October of both 1997 and 1998, the peak season for scallop harvest in North Florida, whole bay scallops were harvested on Thursday afternoons by research personnel, chilled to approximately 45-F overnight, and delivered to the cooperating restaurants on Friday afternoons.\n\nImmediately after harvest, the scallops were taken to a commercial seafood wholesaler where they were placed in a polyethylene-lined expanded styrene shipping box. The scallops were usually placed in four layers of 25 each, for a total of 100 per box except for weeks when only 70 were packed. Each layer was separated by moist newspapers. Two chilled gel-packs were placed inside each box to maintain temperatures in the 45--50-F range during the one to two hours they were in transit to the restaurants. All boxes were tagged with shellfish harvest permits in compliance with Florida's Department of Environmental Protection's rules for fresh shellstock.\n\nA \"daily discard\" form was affixed to the lid of each container so that daily mortality rates could be determined. However, reliable estimates of scallop mortality could not be obtained because the limited supplies of scallops available to each restaurant (70 to 100 per week) were usually exhausted within 24 to 48 hours after delivering. The only exception was the very first week; combined data from three restaurants showed losses oftwo percent during the first 24 hours, and two restaurants had a cumulative loss of about 22 percent after 72 hours. Initially, it was anticipated that restaurants would receive shipments of scallops each week. However, inclement weather prevented harvest on numerous occasions, and limited quantities of marketable sizes also reduced product availability during both the 1997 and 1998 season. The chefs prepared the whole bay scallops as menu specials and recommended them to customers.\n\nTo gain the cooperation of the chefs, no restrictions were placed on the preparation or cooking methods. However, wait staff was required to record the type of dish each respondent had eaten so that consumer evaluations could be analyzed by type of dish. All four restaurants served the scallops as some type of appetizer; these appetizers ranged from chioppini (fisherman's stew) to scallops Rockefeller to simple lemon-shallot butter or garlic butter sauce. The appetizers ranged in price from $4.95 to $7.95. Only one restaurant used the scallops as an ingredient in a main entree; scallops and smoked trout were incorporated into a pasta dish that was priced at $14.95. Approximately 6 to 8 scallops were served in each dish, depending on the size of scallops available. Analyses of respondents willingness to buy scallops again by type of dish eaten revealed no significant differences among the various dishes.\n\nA total of 106 restaurant patrons completed questionnaires, far short of the initial goal of 400 observations. A copy of the questionnaire is found in Appendix A. According to the chefs, approximately 50 percent of the patrons ordering whole bay scallops completed questionnaires. This was corroborated by analyzing the numbers of scallops delivered to the restaurants and the numbers of scallops served in each dish. As mentioned previously, the number of consumer observations was severely restricted by product availability. The wait staff was instructed to promote the product and given instructions as to how to administer the questionnaire. A copy of the instructions to the wait staff is also found in Appendix A. Chefs were given an incentive of$5.00 for each completed questionnaire; in most cases, the chef gave the entire incentive to the wait staff.\n\nIn addition to the restaurant patrons, citizens participating in a community fundraising event were asked to evaluate the whole bay scallops. These \"fund-raisers\" were given samples of the whole bay scallops which had been prepared by a chef associated with one of the restaurants participating in the formal study. It should be noted that data from the \"fund-raiser\" sample were not analyzed in combination with the restaurant patrons due to demographic differences and the fact that the fund-raisers did not have to purchase the product. Further, the whole bay scallops sampled by the fund-raisers were not comparable to the product served to the restaurant patrons. They were late season scallops that were smaller than those used in the restaurant evaluations.\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted on the various product attributes and respondents' demographic characteristics. While some relationships between demographic characteristics and the responses were hypothesized, none could be found statistically significant based on Chi-square analyses because of the limited sample sizes and the nonnormal distribution of both the response variables and the independent variables (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967). However, informational statistics were employed to ascertain the relative amount of information a given characteristic contributed to the various survey responses (Cover & Thomas, 1991). An overview of the information statistics procedure is found in Appendix B. In order to effectively utilize the Information Statistics technique, the five-point semantic differential scale was collapsed into three categories, i.e., \"excellent\" and \"very good\" into \"positive\"; \"good\" became \"neutral\" and \"fair\" and \"poor\" were categorized as \"negative\". Tabular results of statistical analyses and discussion of the survey responses and respondents' demographics follows. These results provide valuable insights for developing market development strategies for whole bay scallops.\n\nOf the 106 restaurant patrons completing the survey, 62 were male and 44 were female (Table 1). Fourteen percent were under age 35, and 37 percent were between 35 and 49 years of age. About 36 percent were between 50 and 64, and 12 percent were 65 years of age or older. Roughly half, 50 respondents, reportedly dined at moderately upscale restaurants in moderation, that is more than once per month but less than once per week. Thirty-six (34 percent) were classified as \"infrequent\" patrons of upscale restaurants, dining out once per month or less. Nineteen (18 percent) were classified as \"frequent\" patrons of upscale restaurants, dining at such restaurants once per week or more. There were 40 restaurant patrons (38 percent) that reported eating shellfish infrequently, that is less than once a month. Thirty-eight (36 percent) were classified as moderate consumers of shellfish, indicating that they ate shellfish more than once per month but less than once per week. Twenty-six (25 percent) were frequent shellfish consumers, indicating that they ate shellfish at least once a week.\n\nRespondents were asked why they selected whole bay scallops. Multiple answers were allowed, with possible responses being 1) Familiarity with product, 2) Suggested by staff or chef, 3) Menu special, 4) Price and 5) Curiosity. Nearly two-thirds (63.5 percent) of the restaurant patrons indicated that their decision to select whole bay scallops was influenced by wait staff or the chef (Table 2). Thirty-four (33 percent) noticed whole bay scallops were a menu special and similar numbers were simply curious. Thirty-two were familiar with the product and six cited price as an influencing factor. Most respondents in the restaurant sample had few qualms about eating whole bay scallops. The initial reaction to the thought of eating a whole bay scallop was not one of hesitation for most of the restaurant patrons (Table 3). On a rating scale of one to nine, where one was not hesitant at all and nine was extremely hesitant, the average response was 2.2. None of 105 respondents answering the question indicated a nine. Only eighteen scored their hesitation as five to eight, which could be interpreted as having reservations about eating the scallops whole. Sixty-nine, almost two-thirds, were not hesitant at all. Females rated their hesitancy slightly higher than males, and respondents 65 and older were the least hesitant. Those respondents eating out more often were slightly more hesitant than others and those respondents eating shellfish at least once per week were the least hesitant. Information measures were not calculated because of zeroes at the various rating levels.\n\nThe restaurant patrons were asked to rate the whole bay scallops with regard to attributes of appearance, taste, texture, value and their overall satisfaction with the product using a five-point semantic differential scale. Respondents assigned a value of excellent, very good, good, fair or poor to each attribute.\n\nSummaries of the respondents' ratings for appearance, taste, value and overall satisfaction appear below. In general, restaurant patrons' evaluations were positive, with nearly 80 percent of the respondents rating appearance and taste as \"excellent\" or \"very good\". Texture and overall satisfaction were rated \"excellent\" or \"very good\" by 73 and 76 percent of the restaurant patrons, respectively. Value received the lowest evaluations, with only 58 percent rating it as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" (Table 4).\n\nThe evaluations by the fund-raisers were not as favorable as those of the restaurant patrons. Percentages of fund-raisers rating appearance, taste and texture as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" were about 35 points below the comparable ratings given by restaurant patrons. Only 31 percent ofthe fund-raiser sample rated overall satisfaction as \"excellent\" or \"very good\". In contrast, about 45 percent rated overall satisfaction as \"fair\" or \"poor\" (Table 5). Detailed evaluations by the fund-raiser sample are found in the Appendix C. 12 Table 3.

One obvious reason was the restaurant patrons represented a \"self selected\" group of consumers that made a conscious decision to purchase the product because of persuasion of the chef or wait staff, innate curiosity, or familiarity with the product. Thus, this group would have contained individuals with a high propensity to like the product; those that may have had a predisposition to dislike the product opted to not purchase it. On the other hand, the fund-raiser respondents made no conscious purchase decision; they received a serving of the product for evaluation whether or not they anticipated liking it, consequently the evaluations ofthis group were lower. Because the fund-raisers represented a somewhat atypical group of consumers, detailed analyses of their product ratings are relegated to the Appendix. The following sections focus on product evaluations by various demographic subgroups of the restaurant patron sample. Sparse numbers of observations in demographic and ratings categories precluded rigorous statistical analyses. However, the five-point semantic differential scale was aggregated into \"positive\", \"neutral\" and \"negative\" categories to facilitate use of the information statistics technique.\n\nThe appearance of whole bay scallops was rated highly, with 44.3 percent of the 106 restaurant patrons rating appearance \"excellent\" and 33 percent rating appearance \"very good\" (Table 6). Roughly 20 percent rated appearance \"good\" or \"fair\" and only 2.8 percent (three respondents) said the appearance was \"poor\". More women rated appearance as \"excellent\" (50 percent of women, 40 percent of men). The under age 35 and the over age 65 categories seemed slightly more critical of appearance than the 35-64 groups. Respondents that dined out most frequently rated appearance slightly lower than other diners, while those that consume shellfish most often were slightly more impressed with the product's appearance.\n\nThe positive, neutral and negative ratings provide the relative information measure for the total characteristic contribution and for each level of the given characteristic. The highest informational content was found in the \"frequency of shellfish consumption\" characteristic. Age was the second greatest contributing characteristic, while gender and \"frequency of dining out\" provided relatively smaller amounts of information (Table 7).\n\nTaste was rated \"excellent\" by 48.6 percent of the restaurant patrons and almost 30 percent rated taste as \"very good\" (Table 8). Slightly over 14 percent rated taste as \"good.\" Seven respondents (6.7 percent) rated taste as \"fair\" and only one rated taste as \"poor.\" Ratings for taste by male and female respondents were very similar. Respondents between 50 and 64 years of age rated taste lowest, while the other three age categories rated taste higher. Respondents that consume shellfish moderately were slightly less impressed with taste than either the light or heavy shellfish consumers.\n\nThe highest informational statistic referring to restaurant patrons' evaluation oftaste was found for the age variable (Table 9). Note that the under age 35 and the 35-49 age categories were combined to eliminate zeroes from analysis. Moderate and frequent diners, and moderate and frequent shellfish consumers were also combined to eliminate zeroes. The resulting relative information measures showed that frequency of shellfish consumption, gender of the respondent, and the frequency of dining out each contributed relative information totaling about .02, compared to .07 for the age characteristic. 100.0 RA relative information measure is a positive value. It is not predictive. The larger the value, the more information that particular demographic characteristic contributes to the response. See Appendix B for further explanation.   .0 \"A relative information measure is a positive value. It is not predictive. The larger the value, the more information that particular demographic characteristic contributes to the response. See Appendix B for further explanation. bThe under age 35 and the 35-49 age categories were combined into the \"under 50\" category to eliminate zeroes. Frequent and moderate diners were combined to eliminate zeroes. Frequent and moderate shellfish consumers were combined to eliminate zeroes.\n\nOverall, restaurant patrons rated texture of the whole bay scallops as \"excellent\" (40 percent), \"very good\" (33.3 percent) and \"good\" (13.3 percent) (Table 10). Another 12 restaurant patrons rated the product's texture \"fair\" (11.4 percent) and two patrons rated texture as \"poor\" (1.9 percent). Females were slightly more positive in their overall ratings of texture. Respondents over age 65 and those aged 35-49 rated texture more highly than those in the under 35 and the 50-64 categories. Those dining out a moderate number of times rated texture only slightly lower than the others. Those eating shellfish at least once per week were most favorable in regard to texture. Light and moderate diners rated texture slightly lower.\n\nAge and gender contributed more relative information regarding restaurant patrons' evaluations of the texture of whole bay scallops (Table 11). The information measures were all very small, but could be ranked in order of importance as age, gender, frequency of dining out and frequency of shellfish consumption.\n\nRestaurant patrons were asked to rate the value of whole bay scallops in the context of product received at the menu price paid. Value was rated \"excellent\" by 34 (35.4 percent), less often than appearance, taste, texture or overall satisfaction (Table 12). A rating of \"very good\" was given by 22 restaurant patrons and \"good\" by 26. Value was rated \"fair\" by 13 and \"poor\" by one. Men rated the value of the whole bay scallops slightly higher than the women. Respondents ages 35-49 rated the value the lowest with those in the other age categories rating value slightly better or roughly the same. Those dining out most often rated the value of the whole bay scallops slightly higher than those eating out less often. Those consuming shellfish at least once a week rated value higher than those that consumed shellfish less often. Many respondents provide written comments which provide insights on their product evaluations. The small size of the scallops was a recurring comment which undoubtedly (and negatively) affected their perceptions of value.\n\nInformation measures pointed to frequency of shellfish consumption as the most explanatory demographic variable regarding the rating of the value of whole bay scallops (Table 13). Age was the second most explanatory variable. Gender and frequency of dining out provided much smaller measures of relative information. 20 .0 \"A relative information measure is a positive value. It is not predictive. The larger the value, the more information that particular demographic characteristic contributes to the response. See Appendix B for further explanation. bThe 50-64 and 65+ age categories were combined to eliminate zeroes.\n\nOverall satisfaction with the whole bay scallops was rated \"excellent\" by 48 (45.3 percent) ofthe restaurant patrons and \"very good\" by 33 (33.1 percent). Only 14 respondents (13.2 percent) rated overall satisfaction as \"good\", and eight (7.5 percent) rated overall satisfaction as \"fair\" and three (2.8 percent) rated overall satisfaction with the purchase as \"poor.\" Thus, it appears that the overwhelming majority of the restaurant patrons were very satisfied with the whole bay scallops (Table 14). Thus, nearly 80 percent of the respondents appeared to be very satisfied with the product. Females indicated slightly more overall satisfaction than men. The age categories' mean ratings of overall satisfaction were similar for the under 35,35-49, and over 65 age groups and slightly less satisfaction was indicated by the 50-64 age group. The respondents eating out moderately often were slightly less satisfied than the infrequent diners and the frequent diners were slightly more satisfied with their purchase than the others. Light and heavy shellfish consumers indicated equivalent overall satisfaction with the moderate shellfish consumers indicating slightly less overall satisfaction (Table 14).\n\nFrequency of shellfish consumption contributed the most information relative to restaurant patrons' overall satisfaction with whole bay scallops (Table 15). The second most relevant demographic variable was age, followed by frequency of dining out and then gender. 100.0 RA relative information measure is a positive value. It is not predictive. The larger the value, the more information that particular demographic characteristic contributes to the response. See Appendix B for further explanation. \"Moderate and frequent shellfish consumers were combined to eliminate zeroes.\n\nWillingness to Order Whole Bay Scallops in the Future at the Same Price When asked whether or not they would buy whole bay scallops again, most restaurant patrons responded favorably (Table 16). Eighty-seven (84.5 percent) said they were willing to buy whole bay scallops in the future at the same price. A logistic analysis of the data indicated that no demographic characteristics were significant for predicting a given restaurant patron's willingness to buy whole bay scallops, although slightly larger percentage of women were willing to order whole bay scallops in the future at the same price. The percentage of respondents 65 or older willing to order the scallops again was also higher than younger age categories. All but one of the heaviest shellfish consumers (96.2 percent) indicated a willingness to order whole bay scallops in the future, while 10 (27 percent) of the more moderate shellfish consumers would not order them again. Only four (10.5 percent) of the infrequent shellfish consumers indicated that they would not purchase whole bay scallops again (Table 16).\n\nThe frequency of shellfish consumption provided by far the most information regarding restaurant patrons' willingness to buy whole bay scallops again in the future relative to the other demographic and behavioral variables (Table 17). The age category provided a moderate amount of information, but the gender of the respondent and the frequency of dining out added little information regarding willingness to buy whole bay scallops again. .0 \"A relative information measure is a positive value. It is not predictive. The larger the value, the more information that particular demographic characteristic contributes to the response. See Appendix B for further explanation.\n\nOverall, the chefs in the participating restaurants were very pleased with the whole bay scallops and were willing to include them on their menus in the future. Chefs cited the appeal of a \"local\" product that was \"farm-raised.\" The chefs indicated that aquacultured products are easy to promote because they combat the perception of over-fishing in the area. They also suggested that table tents would be an acceptable and effective means of promoting the product.\n\nThe chefs noted that those ordering the new menu item tended to be middle-aged, 40-55 years old, and probably upper-middle class. Scallop dishes were not of interest to children. It was also noted that \"old timers\" and \"locals\" who were not accustomed to eating whole scallops were not inclined to order them. The chefs had the perception that visitors from other geographic areas were more accepting of the idea of eating whole scallops.\n\nAlthough the whole scallops had a non-traditional appearance, the chefs welcomed another type of shellfish to add diversity to their menus. Slight fouling, such as the barnacles encountered in the 1997 season, was acceptable to chefs and patrons alike. The chefs observed that the slight fouling gave the product a \"natural\" look. However, the heavier fouling that was common during the 1998 season detracted from the products's appearance, especially in pasta dishes. When served on the half-shell, the fouling posed no serious problems because the top half of the shell was removed. The chefs also suggested that a wholesale price of about 25 cents each would be acceptable, \"like clams, but maybe a little higher.\" They observed that at a wholesale cost of 25 cents each, the ingredient cost of scallops would be about $1.50 per dish, in line with other appetizers that retailed for $4.95 to $5.95.\n\nWhile scallops that were received on Friday were usually sold out by Monday, the chefs estimated that shelf life may be from three to five days. However, the chefs stressed that the shell stock should be \"tempered\" to maximize shelf life. Cooling shellfish harvested in 80%F waters to refrigeration temperatures too quickly results in damage and short shelf life. Comments regarding packaging indicated that damp excelsior would be both effective and acceptable.\n\nThis study showed that whole bay scallops, when professionally prepared and presented, can be a successful part of full-service, white table cloth restaurant menus. Restaurant patrons ordering whole bay scallops rated the attributes of appearance, taste, texture, value and overall satisfaction quite highly. Further, many restaurant patrons were curious and few were apprehensive about whole bay scallops, even though eating the whole animal is not the common practice in the U.S. Taste was rated more highly than the other attributes which bodes well for future success in marketing the product. Value was rated a bit lower than the other characteristics, and based on written comments from the respondents, this may have been a result of the product size. The small size was the most prevalent negative comment from the survey respondents (Appendix D). The perception of value could be enhanced by including more scallops per serving, lowering the retail price, or doing both.\n\nInformational statistics showed that frequency of consuming shellfish provides the greatest relative amount of information regarding restaurant patrons' evaluation of product characteristics and willingness to order whole bay scallops in the future; frequent consumers of shellfish appear to be the most favorably impressed with whole bay scallops. In addition, the participating chefs indicated that middle-aged patrons were most likely to order the product. The chefs also observed that locals and older patrons familiar with traditional scallop dishes (adductor muscle only) were not as likely to order whole scallops. On a positive note, although a small number of whole bay scallops were delivered to the participating local restaurants, the demand outstripped supply quickly, with all the product delivered on Friday being sold before Monday morning. Thus, it appears that markets could be readily developed if adequate supplies of reasonably-sized whole bay scallops were forthcoming.\n\nSuccessful marketing efforts will require careful professional preparation. Satisfaction with whole bay scallops is probably most dependent on preparation and presentation. Chef or serving staff recommendations appear effective in directing restaurant patrons' interest in dishes which includes whole bay scallops, but their efforts could be enhanced through the use oftabJe tents. These marketing materials could include information promoting the product as a locally grown, aquacultured species. This message would appeal to those concerned with overfishing and environmental preservation issues. The whole bay scallop can also be promoted as a \"local\" novelty dish to tourists. In addition, the local population may become more accustomed to the whole bay scallop product as opposed to the traditional muscle-only product given time and educational efforts.\n\na market research project of Questions or concerns regarding this research may be also directed to The University of Florida UFIRB Office Box 112250 Gainesville, FL 32611-2250 31 The Florida Agricultural Market Research Center Dr. R.

AS you probably know, reaction to the whole bay scallops has been very positive.\n\nWe plan to conduct this consumer research a few more weeks, but our supplies of scallops are very limited. Elease make every serving count.bY doing the following:\n\nThe questionnaire used for the fund-raiser sample was identical to that used for the restaurant sample. Thus, discussions of fund-raisers' attributes and their evaluations of whole bay scallops follow the same general outline as used for the restaurant patrons.\n\nOf the 44 participants from the fund-raiser group, half were male and half female (Appendix Table I). Five were under 35 years of age, 14 were 35-49,12 were 50-64 and nine were over 65. Thirteen (30 percent) dined at upscale restaurants infrequently, 19 (43 percent) moderately often, while 10 (23 percent) patronized upscale restaurants at least once per week. Eleven (25 percent) consumed shellfish at least once per week, 23 (52 percent) ate shellfish moderately often, and six ate shellfish infrequently.\n\nRespondents were asked why they selected whole bay scallops. Multiple answers were allowed, with possible responses being 1) Familiarity with product, 2) Suggested by staff or chef, 3) Menu special, and 4) Curiosity. Note that price did not apply to participants from the fundraiser group because these respondents had been provided scallops as part of a fund-raiser/dinner at a fixed price instead of as an a la carte menu item.\n\nSuggestion by wait staff or the chef influenced 18 (43.9 percent) participants of the fundraiser group to try the whole bay scallops. Fifteen (37 percent) tried them because they were listed as a menu special, and 10 (24 percent) because of curiosity. Four respondents, about 10 percent, said they tried the whole bay scallops because they were familiar with them (Appendix\n\nFund-raisers indicated more hesitancy than the restaurant patrons with an average rating of 3.5 on the one to nine scale where \"one\" indicated \"not hesitant at all\" and \"nine\" represented \"extremely hesitant\" (Appendix Table 3). Six out of the 43 (14 percent) fund-raisers rated their hesitation a nine. However, 21, nearly half, indicated no hesitation at all. Females rated their hesitation higher than males, and respondents 65 years old or more rated their hesitancy higher than any other age group. The most frequent diners and the most frequent shellfish consumers indicated more hesitation than the others. These results are consistent with the perceptions voiced by the chefs, i.e, that local residents that typically eat the adductor muscle only, would be more averse to eating the whole animal.\n\nFund-raisers were asked to rate the whole bay scallops with regard to appearance, taste, texture, value and overall satisfaction using a five-point semantic differential scale. Respondents assigned a value of excellent, very good, good, fair or poor to each attribute. Since members of the fund-raiser group did not purchase whole bay scallops as a separately priced menu item, their ratings of value were not analyzed.\n\nOf the 44 fund-raisers, 27.3 percent rated appearance of the whole bay scallops \"excellent\" and 13.6 percent \"very good\" (Appendix Table 4). About 30 percent rated appearance \"good,\" but 13.6 percent rated appearance \"fair\" and 16 percent rated appearance as \"poor.\" An even number of men and women (six of each) rated appearance as \"excellent\" but men rated appearance slightly lower overall. The 35-49 age category rated appearance higher than the other categories and the over 65 age category averaged the lowest rating on appearance. The infrequent diners at upscale restaurants rated appearance highest and the more frequent diners lowest. Those respondents eating shellfish at least once a week rated appearance slightly higher than the infrequent and moderately frequent shellfish consumers.\n\nOnly eight (18.2 percent) ofthe fund-raisers rated taste as \"excellent\" (Appendix Table 5). Ratings of \"very good,\" \"good\" and \"fair\" were reported by 11 (25 percent), 12 (27.3 percent) and 10 (22.7 percent), respectively. Three rated taste as \"poor.\" Equal numbers of men and women rated taste as \"excellent.\" Overall, women rated taste slightly higher than men. Those respondents under age 35 and over age 65 rated taste lower overall than those in the middle age groups. Those dining out most often in upscale restaurants rated taste lowest and those dining out once per month or less rated taste the highest. Respondents eating shellfish once per month or less rated taste higher than those consuming shellfish moderately or often or frequently. 38 Appendix Table 3.

Equal numbers of number of men and women rated texture as \"excellent\" or \"very good\". Overall, females were just slightly more positive regarding the scallop texture than males. Respondents over 65 rated texture the lowest and those 50-64 rated more positively than the those in other age categories. The more frequent diners rated texture slightly lower than either infrequent or moderate diners. Those consuming shellfish at least once a week rated texture the highest (Appendix Table 6).\n\nFund-raisers were also asked to rate overall satisfaction, but results should be regarded in light of the fact that these respondents did not purchase the product and may have had a pre-existing aversion to whole bay scallops.\n\nOut of 42 respondents providing from fund-raiser group, nine (21.4 percent) rated their overall satisfaction with the product as \"excellent\" (Appendix Table 7). An additional four (9.5 percent) rated overall satisfaction as \"very good\" and ten (23.8 percent) rated it \"good.\" Overall satisfaction ratings of \"fair\" or \"poor\" were indicated by 11 (26.2 percent) and eight (19 percent) ofthe fund-raisers, respectively. Women rated overall satisfaction higher than men. The average rating of overall satisfaction was around three, with the over 65 age group slightly less satisfied with a mean rating of satisfaction of3.5. Respondents eating out least often were more satisfied with the product. 42 Appendix Table 6.

Very familiar with farm raised clams. I am happy to see scallops being done. Scallops were tender and succulent.\n\nThe stew these scallops were served in was extremely complimentary to the scallop meat. Very tasty. Exceptional quality.\n\nThe scallops were wonderful. They would taste great over rice.\n\nGreat idea; but....\n\nExcellent sauce.\n\n10. I thought they were excellent. The size of the portion (8) was appropriate. The sauce they're served in is superb.\n\nThey were very tasteful! I could hardly tell the difference between these and natural ones.\n\nhow I would like it without sauce. When I think of sea scallops, I think of a \"sweet taste\".\n\nThey were so tiny we all laughed.\n\nThe were smaller than I expected. Eight scallops for $5.95 is a tad bit pricey. They did have good texture and flavor. Good idea to raise instead of harvest \"native.\"\n\nThe scallops were smaller than I expected. The preparation was excellent. Garlic, butter and parsley I expect.\n\n23. Good taste.\n\nLet the scallops grow bigger.\n\nDelicious dish!\n\nThe scallops had a rather \"fishy\" taste.\n\nSomewhat gritty.\n\nNeed a little more time to purge--some grit.\n\nGarlic and butter sauce were great with the scallops.\n\nThere was more \"fish\" flavor than bay scallops I have purchased in the past. This appealed to me. I would definitely order again. Are they safer health wise? Environmentally? I would be even more interested if I knew ordering these reduced over-harvesting of natural sources. Do you control the water quality?\n\nGlad to see this type of research! 32.\n\nVery good!\n\nSomewhat gritty, but very tasty!\n\nWe gather scallops in the Keaton Del area each July.\n\nGreat.\n\nThe concept is there, but \"cleaned\" scallops -even if consumers didn't know they were cleaned, have a natural sweet taste that was missed in whole scallops.\n\n37. Very pleasant. I don't know why, but scallops have never been served to me in their shells. Why not? I suspect the large ones I have been served before were not scallops?\n\nDelicious.\n\nVery good texture (not stringy). Good flavor.\n\nA bit undersized. A large scallop would make a better presentation. Crackers take away the taste. Perhaps bread instead. In addition, garnish the plate for a better presentation. Especially in upscale restaurants.\n\nThey were great.\n\nThey looked small. Taste wasn't excellent.\n\nWithout the barnacles they would be perfect.\n\nJust great, but a little small.\n\nA dozen for the price would be a better deal. Good stuffthough.\n\nToo small!! 47. I thought it was wonderful. It looked very appealing and tasted great.\n\n1.\n\nScallops were very small!!\n\nThe scallops were too small but very good. I am a scallop nut.\n\nLove scallop muscle but not whole scallop! 4. I love raw oysters -but eating anything but the muscle of the clam is not too pleasing.\n\nFishy.\n\nSmall.\n\nToo small.\n\n8. Too small.\n\nScallops were very small -very difficult to eat -let them get bigger.\n\nThey need to be bigger.\n\n11. These scallops were great, they just need to grow up. Too small.\n\n12. Super grub.\n\n13. Great food.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThe scallops were way too small but the flavor and presentation were excellent.\n\nBeautiful but small.\n\nScallops were harvested too small! 18. Excellent.\n\nScallops are delicious, but the whole animal is pretty disgusting before it is separated from its shell.\n\nSamples were very small.\n\nToo small.\n\nProduct was too small physically and quantitatively to evaluate ...but as is obvious, the wine had a good effect!!! 23. I love the taste of all shellfish.\n\nThey were too small and 1 prefer the white meat only. Larger wild scallops are much sweeter. Of course that may be due to the way they were prepared. I do however hope this project is successful and has commercial success. No comparison to farm raised clams.\n\n25. I'd rather eat clams! They were too small to evaluate. They might be good, but too small. We needed more to eat.\n\nWonderful.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF SMALL-SCALE, COMMERCIAL CULTURE OF BAY SCALLOPS INTRODUCTION DESCRIPTION OF NURSERY AND GROWOUT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS Rack System Longline System BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ANALYSIS Production Assumptions Financial Assumptions FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS Initial Capital Investment Requirement Annual Operating Expense 9 Variable Costs Fixed Costs Enterprise Budget Cash Flow SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Market Price and Survival Market Price Survival Market Price and Survival Combined Stocking Density and Marketability 20 Stocking Density 20 Percent Marketable 20 Stocking Density and Percent Marketable Combined 21 Growout Cages: Cost and Economic Life 21 Cost 21 EconomicLife 21 Cost and EconomicLife Combined 22 Cost of Scallop Seed 22 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION 22\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to examine the feasibility of the small-scale culture of bay scallops intended for the fresh, whole market in Florida. Potential investors in bay scallop culture need to know the expected costs and earnings of the culture process in order to make a wise investment decision. The following analysis provides a pro forma assessment of the financial characteristics of a hypothetical culture operation. This approach is dictated since no commercial bay scallop culture operations currently exist in Florida. The analysis examines only the financial characteristics of the nursery and growout components of the culture process. An assessment of the hatchery process is omitted since the methods employed for the bay scallop hatchery process are very similar to those utilized for hard clams. Previous studies have examined the financial characteristics of a hard clam hatchery (Adams and et. al. 1991;Adams and Pomeroy 1992). Thus, for the purpose of this analysis, the cost of the hatchery is included only as the cost of bay scallop seed. In contrast, the methods suggested by this study for the nursery and growout of bay scallops differ considerably from those currently being utilized for hard clam nursery and growout (Adams and van Blokland 1998). Thus, the analysis focuses only on those two phases of the production process.\n\nThe following discussion initially describes the alternative production processes utilized in the analysis. Then, the basic underlying production and financial assumptions regarding the analysis are outlined. Next, the financial characteristics of each production method are described, which includes initial capital investment requirements, capital replacement needs, annual operating expenses, average annual net returns, and cash flow characteristics. Finally, a financial sensitivity analysis examines the changes in net returns resulting from changes in market price of whole bay scallops, overall survival rate, growout stocking density, marketability of harvested scallops, cost of seed, and cost/expected life of growout cages.\n\nTwo different hypothetical production methods were examined: (a) rack system and (b) longline system. These production systems were identified as potential methods for producing bay scallops in the Crystal River, Florida region. Although commercial attempts to culture bay scallops have not occurred to date in Florida, the production trials during this study suggest that these two systems hold promise as viable methods that a commercial operation may employ. The scale of operation was assumed to be 100 growout cages. This scale was deemed appropriate given the uncertainty associated with near-term commercial seed availability and the logistics (in particular, labor requirements) of actually operating the production system. In addition, a maintained assumption in the study was that the small-scale culture process should be intended as a supplemental source of income, at least until the culture technology, seed availability, and market potential is more fully developed and better understood.\n\nBoth systems serve nursery and growout functions. The seed scallops are initially placed in nursery bags constructed of soft, 3mm, nylon mesh material. These nursery bags are placed within the wire growout cages (two bags in each cage) to protect against predation. Each growout cage has dimensions of approximately 2'X2'X6\" and is constructed of plastic-coated 0.5\" wire mesh. The seed scallops remain within these bags until they reach the appropriate size to be stocked directly into the growout cages. The growout cages are continually monitored and the scallops are harvested when market size is obtained.\n\nThe \"rack\" system consists of a series of rebar frames, or racks, each of which are designed to hold 10 growout cages. These racks are very similar to those utilized for holding nursery bags and growout cages for oyster culture in Levy County, Florida, during Project OCEAN. Each rack would be designed with the dimensions necessary to hold at least 10 growout cages. The racks would be constructed of 0.5\", #4-grade welded rebar. The individual cages would slide into shelves within the rack frame and be held in place with plastic ties, or some other attachment means. Given the scale assumption of 100 cages, the 10 racks could be placed in a single line, all attached to each other by a single 3/8\" poly rope (Figure 1). A trap float would be attached with a single 1/4\" poly rope to the top center of each rack to allow for easy location on the lease site. Placement and servicing of the racks would require the use of a boom and winch apparatus, as well as a small boat with a wide enough beam to provide the necessary stability. The racks and cages would periodically be hoisted to the surface and placed aboard the boat for inspection, cleaning, harvesting, restocking, maintenance, etc. Alternatively, the racks could be accessed with either snorkel or scuba gear after initial placement on the lease site, and each cage removed from the rack and brought to the surface individually.  Longline System\n\nThe longline system consists of a series of mainline segments, each with growout cages individually attached to the mainline (Figure 1). Each mainline is a DO-foot length of 1/4\" poly rope, with each end attached to the bottom with a 4-foot screw anchor. Each mainline has 10 cages spaced 10 feet apart. The cages are each clipped to the mainline with a 9-foot, 1/4\" poly rope gangion and bridle.\n\nThe gangionlbridle length being shorter than 10 feet will minimize the amount of entangling among cages. The distance from each anchor to the adjacent cage is 20 feet. Each mainline is weighted with 2ounce \"clamp-on\" weights attached in 7-foot intervals. Each end of a mainline is marked with a trap buoy. Given that the operation will consist of 100 cages, there will be 10 mainline segments required. The cages can be accessed by lifting the buoy rope on either end of the mainline so that the mainline itself can be placed in a guide on the side of the boat. The boat can then move along the mainline, lifting each gangion to within reach in succession. Each cage can then be lifted from the water for inspection, cleaning, etc. Use of the longline system will eliminate the need for a winch and boom apparatus.\n\nThe following set of production and financial assumptions are held during the analysis. Some are relaxed when the sensitivity analysis is performed.\n\n* Stocking sizes:\n\n-into the nursery bags at 3mm shell length -directly into the growout cages at 17-18mm shell length * Production period length:\n\n-the nursery phase requires approximately 4 months (February -May) -the growout phase requires approximately 5 months (June -October) Stocking densities:\n\n-nursery bags at a density of 500 per bag\n\n-growout cages at a density of200 per cage (501ft ) * Survival:\n\n-75% during the nursery phase -80% during the growout phase -60% during the total production period aware of the initial investment and annual operational costs of a small-scale, culture operation. Knowledge of both the type and magnitude of these costs is required. The investor also needs to know what the expected annual net returns would be. Knowledge of the cash flow provided by the operation will allow an investor to determine how soon the initial investment costs can be recovered and when a positive net return to cash costs can be expected. An annual budget will provide an investor with the expected net returns for a typical year in the planning horizon of the business. The budget can also be used to determine the total cost per harvested scallop, the minimum market price that must be received, and the maximum level of mortality that can be tolerated. These annual financial characteristics of the hypothetical small-scale, bay scallop culture operation are discussed in the following section. The baseline assumptions are adhered to in this analysis. The sensitivity analysis will allow these assumptions to vary.\n\nThe largest single investment for either the rack or longline system are the growout cages. The total cost of the growout cages for each system is $2,300, which represents 58% and 65% ofthe total investment cost for the rack and longline systems, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). The collective cost for boat gear required with the rack system is $930, most of which is associated with the lifting apparatus required to hoist the racks from the water (e.g., boom, pulley, power winch, and rope). The longline system doesn't require the racks, boom and winch, but does require a longline (i.e., mainline, gangions, and bridles) which costs about $420. The other costs for each systems are similar. A pump and hoses/fittings are required for power washing the cages on a periodic basis. Other costs include nursery bags, a screen for sorting out undersize scallops, coolers for transporting the harvested scallops, and miscellaneous supplies. The total investment cost for the rack and longline systems is $3,326 and $3,508, respectively. As the gear becomes obsolete due to corrosion, wear, etc., capital replacement costs must be anticipated. Some capital items can be expected to have a longer economic life than others. For example, the rebar racks may last as long as 10 years, whereas the nursery bags and pump can be expected to last no more than 3 years. The average annual capital replacement cost can be approximated by computing the annual depreciation cost. The annual non-cash cost of depreciation is $849 and $807 for the rack and longline system, respectively. The actual timing of replacement is related to the economic life assigned to each capital item (Tables 3 and 4). And although depreciation is a non-cash cost for accounting purposes, the replacement cost which it approximates is a cash expense. The largest capital replacement cash cost occurs in Year 6 as the growout cages are replaced. These important cash costs will have an impact on the cash flow characteristics ofthe business and must be anticipated accurately by the investor. --\n\n--------$ 807 Operational expenses are typically expressed in two distinct categories: variable costs and fixed costs. Variable costs are those that are vary directly with the level of production (i.e., number of cages or scallops stocked). Fixed costs are often referred to as \"overhead\" and typically do not change with the level of production. The estimated variable and fixed costs for both production systems are presented in Tables 5 and 6. Total annual operating expenses for the rack and longline systems are $2,159 and $2,117, respectively. ----$ 100 Supplies / expendables ----$ 100 Packing materials ----$ 200 Labor and wages -------Total Variable Costs $1,220 Fixed Costs Insurance ------Interest ----$ 0 Permits and licenses Submerged lease fee ----$ 40 DACS certificate ----$ 50 Bookkeeping / accounting fee ----$ 0 Taxes ------Total Fixed (Cash) Costs ----$ 90 Depreciation ----$ 849 Total Fixed Costs $ 939 TOTAL ANNUAL COSTS $2,159 Variable Costs -The largest variable costs for the two systems is fuel, scallop seed and packaging materials. The fuel cost is associated with the boat and pump motors. Fuel for the boat will be determined by the location of the lease site, size of motor, frequency of trips to lease site, etc. A scallop farmer who also is a commercial crabber, may be able to visit the lease site while on a trip to check crab traps, thereby prorating some of the fuel cost to the crab business. A lease site located a considerable distance from the home dock, in a location where the threat of theft is high, or in waters which create excessive fouling may require longer runs or more frequent visits to the lease site. In these cases, fuel costs may be higher than the $500 budgeted in the analysis. Fuel will also be required to run the on-board pump for the pressure washing of the cages while at the lease site.\n\nSeed scallops are assumed to be available from a commercial source for $10 per 1,000. The seed are assumed to be 4-5 mm in size. Assuming that the growout cages are to be stocked with 200 scallops each, a total of 27,000 seed are required to stock the nursery bags. Note that the survival rate assumed for the nursery process is 75%. Other variable costs include repair and maintenance for equipment, supplies / expendables, and packing materials. The cost associated with packing materials includes plastic bags, styrofoam boxes and gel-pacs required to hold the harvested scallops for delivery to a local restaurant. The scallops are assumed to be packed 100 to each container for delivery. The boxes and gel-pacs can be reused. A conservative estimate of approximately $1, including vehicle fuel for transportation, is assigned to the cost of transporting each 1OO-scallop shipment to a restaurant. Total cost for packing materials is $200. The total labor requirement for the hypothetical systems is unknown at present. Thus, labor costs have not been included. It is anticipated, however, that the labor required to operate a smallscale bay scallop culture operation could be supplied by the owner/operator and family. The total variable cost per year is $1,220. This cost is assumed to be the same for both the rack and longline system.\n\nFixed Costs -Typical fixed costs for a business would include salaries, insurance, bookkeeping fees, taxes, interest/principal on loans, depreciation and various annual permits and licences. Given the hypothetical nature of the proposed systems, the analysis only attempts to provide cost estimates for permits/licenses and depreciation. A annual fee for a 2-acre submerged lease is included ($20 per acre). In addition, the FDACS aquaculture permit fee is incurred ($50 annually). Since small-scale culture of scallops is currently intended only as a supplemental income, costs such as insurance and bookkeeping may be allocated to another business enterprise. Thus, these costs have not been included. No loan costs are incurred since the initial capital investment and operating costs for Year I is assumed to be owner financed. Obtaining a loan for a startup business such as scallop culture, with no financial performance history in the region, would be unlikely. With the exception of depreciation, all fixed costs are identical for both the rack and longline systems. The annual depreciation costs are the same as those found in Tables 1 and 2. Total fixed costs for the rack and longline systems are $939 and $987, respectively.\n\nThe enterprise budget provides insight into the average costs (cash and non-cash) and earnings associated with a specific business operation. In this case, annual costs and earnings are averaged over a six-year planning horizon for both the rack and longline production systems. The budgets provide estimates for total revenue, total costs, net returns, and break-even values for two key management variables (Tables 7 and 8).\n\nThe total number of scallops originally stocked is 27,000. Assuming a 60% overall survival rate (i.e., 75% for the nursery, then 80% of the remainder during growout), a total of 16,000 scallops are eventually harvested (i.e., 200 scallops stocked in each of 100 cages, of which 80% survive for harvest). These are assumed to all be of the same size at the time of harvest (i.e., 40-45mm shell length) and sold directly to a local restaurant for $0.25 each. Total revenue from sales of scallops is estimated to be $4,000 annually. Sales of most molluscan shellfish (e.g., oysters, clams, and mussels) must pass through a certified shellfish dealer, as required by law (V.S. Dept. Of Health and Human Services 1997). The National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) specifies within a model ordinance format the various criteria by which molluscan shellfish can be harvested, handled, and distributed within the V.S. These criteria include, for example, water classification rules where harvest can occur, wholesale sale, handling, and shipping methods. These criteria apply to the inter and intrastate shipment of molluscan shellfish. However, these criteria do not apply to the whole scallops in Florida. Currently, the state of Florida does not have the legal authority to enforce these criteria for scallops. This exception only applies, however, to shipments within the state. Any shipments of whole, cultured bay scallops out of the state would invoke those criteria as established by the NSSP. Therefore, the analysis will assume the grower can sell directly to a retail buyer at a higher resulting price than if sold to a wholesale buyer. This assumption may only be valid for the near term, as the state may some day begin enforcing NSSP criteria if significant quantities of whole, cultured scallops begin appearing in local markets. If this happens, the market price realized by a grower, if that grower is not also a certified shellfish dealer, may be lower than that achieved by selling directly into the retail market.\n\nThe variable and fixed costs found in the enterprise budget are identical to those found in the discussion of operational expenses (Tables 5 and 6). When total costs are deducted from total revenue, annual net returns are estimated to be $1,841 and $1,883 for the rack and longline systems, respectively. Recall that owner labor and taxes have not been included in the analysis. Thus, returns are to owner labor, management skills, and taxes. If these costs are included, estimated net returns would be less.\n\nThe enterprise budget provides other values that are useful in describing basic performance standards for the business. The cost per harvested scallop (or break-even market price) is determined by dividing the total annual cost ($2,159) by the total number of scallops harvested annually (16,000). The resulting value ($0.135) is the cost per scallop, or the market price that must be achieved to \"break-even\" Gust cover the costs of production). A market price below 13.5 cents will render the operation unprofitable. The break-even level of survival can also be estimated. This estimate is computed by dividing total cost ($2,159) by the prevailing market price ($0.25). The resulting estimate is then divided by the total number of scallops initially stocked (27,000). The result provides an estimate of the level of overall survival that must be achieved to just cover the total costs of production. Given the set of assumptions utilized in the analysis, any overall survival rate below 32% will render the operation unprofitable. A similar approach would allow break-even survival rates to be estimated for the nursery and growout stages of production.\n\nTable 7: Pro Forma Average Annual Enterprise Budget for a tOO-Cage (to-rack), Bay Scallop Culture Operation Revenue Expense Category Number Unit Price Total Amount Revenue Scallops are harvested at 40-50mm (Survival: 75% N; 80% G; 60% Total) 16,000 $0.25 $4,000 Variable Costs Seed scallops (4-5 mm) 27,000 $10/1,000 $ 270 Fuel/oil (pump, boat, truck) $ 500 Repair / maintenance: Rigging system $ 50 pump, winch, boat, motor $ 100 Supplies / expendables $ 100 Packing materials $ 200 Labor and wages --Total Variable Costs $1,220 Fixed Costs Insurance --Interest $ 0 Permits and licenses Submerged lease fee $ 40 DACS certificate $ 50 Bookkeeping / accounting fee $ 0 Taxes --Total Fixed (Cash) Costs $ 90 Depreciation $ 849 Total Fixed Costs $ 939 Total Costs $2,159 Net Returns to Owner Labor, Management, and $1,841 Taxes ---------------------------------------------Cost per harvested scallop and Break-even $0.135 Market Price (total cost / number harvested) Break-even Survival Rate 32% (total cost / market price / number stocked)  ---------------------------------------------Cost per harvested scallop and Break-even $0.132 Market Price (total cost / number harvested) Break-even Survival Rate 31 % (total cost / market price / number stocked)\n\nThe cash flow analysis provides information on cash income and expenses for each year in the planning horizon of the firm (Tables 9 and 10). Non-cash costs, such as depreciation and reductions in inventory value, are not included. The cash flow allows a prospective bay scallop culturist to determine (1) when the initial capital investment can be recovered, (2) how long before cash receipts exceed cash expenses, (3) in what year the initial positive cumulative cash position occurs, and (4) the cumulative cash position be at the end of the planning horizon.\n\nThe annual cash receipts ($4,000) and cash outflow estimates are the same as those found in the annual enterprise budgets (Table 7 and 8), with one exception. The capital investment estimates reflect the scheduled capital replacement costs as found in Tables 3 and 4. These cash costs replace the annualized non-cash depreciation estimates found in the enterprise budgets. The Total Cash Outflow estimate is the sum ofthe variable costs, fixed costs, and capital investment! replacement costs for a given year. The Annual Cash Position represents the difference between the Cash Receipts and the Total Cash Outflow values for a given year. The Ending Cash Balance is the summation of the Beginning Cash Balance (cash remaining from the previous year) and the Annual Cash Position. This latter value reflects the cash remaining for the year and serves as the Beginning Cash Balance for the next year in the planning horizon. The Ending Cash Position is negative for Year 1. Although the initial capital investment is paid off in Year 1, the operational expenses are not totally recovered. Thus, the business does not \"cash flow\" until Year 2, when all costs, and the negative cash balance carried over from Year 1, are exceeded by cash receipts realized in Year 2. The Ending Cash Balance for Years 2-6 are positive, with an Ending Cash Balance in Year 6 of $8,293. Recall that certain costs, such as labor and taxes, have not been included. If these costs are included as annual expenses, the Ending Cash Balance for each year would be less, possibly delaying an initial positive Ending Cash Balance until Year 3 or later. Also, the number of years required to pay back the initial capital investment would be increased. Note: The cash flow assumes that unit costs and market prices remain constant over the five-year planning horizon. The Annual Cash Position reflects cash returns to owner labor, management, and taxes. As with many of the costs estimated in this analysis, these costs will vary considerably by individual and site location of the operation. As a result, owner labor costs and taxes have not been included. Thus, the Ending Cash Position should be adjusted for individual labor and management payment expectations, and tax costs (federal income and self-employment taxes, if applicable). This will result in a lower Ending Cash Balance each year and may delay payback of initial investment.\n\nTable to: Pro Forma Annual Cash Flow for a tOO-Cage, Longline, Bay Scallop Culture Operation YEAR Cash Item I 2 3 4 5 6 Beginning Cash Balance $ 0 ($ 818) $1,772 $4,292 $6,266 $8,364 Cash Receipts $4,000 $4,000 $4,000 $4,000 $4,000 $4,000 Cash Outflow Variable Costs $1,220 $1,220 $1,220 $1,220 $1,220 $1,220 Fixed Costs (excl. deprec.) $ 90 $ 90 $ 90 $ 90 $ 90 $ 90 Capital Investment! $3,508 $ 100 $ 170 $ 716 $ 592 $2,400 Replacement Total Cash Outflow $4,818 $1,410 $1,480 $2,026 $1,902 $3,710 Annual Cash Position ($ 818) $2,590 $2,520 $1,974 $2,098 $ 290 Ending Cash Balance ($ 818) $1,772 $4,292 $6,266 $8,364 $8,654\n\nNote: The cash flow assumes that unit costs and market prices remain constant over the five-year planning horizon.

This may be particularly true for the culture and marketing for whole, bay scallops in Florida. An understanding of how sensitive profit is to such change can allow the manager to focus attention on controlling those factors that have the greatest influence on the financial performance of the culture operation. A sensitivity analysis was performed on market price, overall survival, growout stocking density, size distribution at time of harvest, seed cost, capital cost (i.e., cages), and useful life of the cages. In a real world setting, several of these factors may be changing simultaneously, which would likely compound their individual effects. In this analysis, however, at most only two factors were allowed to change simultaneously, while all other baseline assumptions were held constant. The sensitivity analysis reports the change to annual net returns resulting from a decrease and/or increase in the respective factor(s). The incremental changes by which each factor is changed was confined to a range deemed to be reasonable based on the current knowledge ofthe market and culture technology. Stocking Density and Marketability (Table 12)\n\nStocking Density -Initial production trials suggest the most effective growout stocking density 2 for bay scallops is between 50-751ft. This is also supported by bay scallop research conducted in the mid-Atlantic region (Oesterling 1998). However, most of the research done in the current study has 2 utilized a growout stocking density of 501ft, which corresponds with a stocking rate of 200 scallops per growout cage. This value was utilized as a baseline production assumption in the economic analysis.\n\nWhen also assuming that alI harvested scallops are of the desired market size, net returns are estimated to be $1,840. If 100% marketability is held constant, net returns per cage increases to $2,770 and $3,711 for 2 2\n\nstocking densities of 250 (621ft) and 300 (751ft) per cage, respectively. Net returns do not increase by the same proportion as the stocking density since an increase in operating expenses equal to the cost of the additional seed clams in incurred. Additional packing and transportation costs are also incurred Percent Marketable -Initial production trials from the current study suggest that a distribution of sizes will be found among the bay scallops in each cage at time of harvest. However, insufficient data are available to provide a clear assessment as to the appropriate size distribution to be expected. This will likely vary by growing conditions and stocking densities. Similar relationships between size distribution at time of harvest and other factors, including stocking densities, general growing conditions, location of lease site, etc., were experienced with the development of the hard clam culture technology (Adams and van Blokland 1998). One method to capture this uncertainty associated with size distribution is to simply impose a range of marketability percentages on the total number of harvested scallops. The marketability percentage was allowed to range from 100% (baseline assumption) to 70% in increments of 10 percentage points. The remaining portion of the harvested scallops was assumed to be unmarketable, even after restocking. If stocking density is held to 200 per cage, net returns decrease from $1,840 for 100% marketable to $640 for 70% marketability. A decrease in marketability will cause a decrease in revenues, but also a decrease in packaging costs, as fewer scallops are packed for shipment.\n\ntaxes. The initial investment is paid back during the first year of the investment, but a positive cash flow does not occur until Year 2. Including labor and tax costs will likely delay the initial occurrence of a positive cash flow until Year 3 or later.\n\nNet returns are found to be most sensitive to market price, overall survival rate, and stocking density. In addition, the size distribution of the harvested scallops effectsnet returns in a manner similar to survival rate (given under the assumption that no restocking of undersize scallops occurs).\n\nAlthough the amount of labor involved in the culture process has not been measured, a labor bill based on the current national minimum wage ($5.65/hr) would allow for 319 man hours during the 9month production process, or 35 hours per month (9 hours per week) on average. Thus, if the culturist spends an average of 9 hours per week managing the bay scaliop lease site, and values each hour at the minimum wage rate of $5.65, the operation would break even. In other words, the labor cost would approximately equal the estimated net returns.\n\nThe impact of scale on the financial performance of the hypothetical production systems was not examined. However, the marginal financial performance (i.e., approximately break even) may improve with facility size. This may be particularly true for the rack system, which does have some capital costs (e.g., the rack lifting apparatus) that could be reduced on average through increased production levels (i.e., number of cages). The same is not true for the longline system, the capital costs of which are almost linearly related to the number of cages. Refining the production system to allow increased stocking 2 densities up to 75/ ft would also increase the net returns of the system. In addition, finding ways to minimize labor requirements, enhance market price, increase the percentage of harvested scallops that are marketable, extend the life of all capital equipment, or share the costs of a boat (i.e., fuel, repair and maintenance, etc.) with another culturist would enhance the profitability of the operation.\n\n-Each participant will receive smaller scallop seed and utilize several systems (suspended bags and raceways) to nurse seed in a land-based facility.
