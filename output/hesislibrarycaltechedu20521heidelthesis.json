Scientists have developed some nucleic acid-based molecular therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes, that can accomplish this down-regulation. However, issues with potency, specificity, and delivery have hampered development of these molecules for more therapeutic applications. In the past few years, a novel mechanism for down-regulation of genes in mammalian cells has been discovered.\n\nTriggered by double-stranded RNA and acting by sequence-specific cleavage of the messenger RNA (mRNA) gene product, this phenomenon is known as \"RNA interference,\" or RNAi. Already having become the tool of choice for researchers to identify gene targets and elucidate function, RNAi has an exciting potential for therapeutic applications that is just starting to be realized. This chapter contains a discussion of the current state of knowledge of RNAi, including comparisons to antisense technology, the mechanism of action, and highlights of therapeutic results.\n\nPrior to the discovery of RNAi and its still-emerging application as a therapeutic, the tool of choice for the down-regulation of a specific target gene was the antisense oligonucleotide. The effector molecule, typically single-stranded DNA (ssDNA, which is more stable to nucleases than ssRNA), is designed to be complementary to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the desired target gene such that it will anneal to the mRNA and prevent translation. The specificity of this approach is based on Watson-Crick base pairing interactions, and the most effective knockdown using this technique is often observed with a an RNase-H dependent cleavage mechanism of mRNA targets.\n\nDespite their promise, the specificity of the biological effects observed by antisense molecules has fallen under question in recent years. In order to minimize the nonspecificity and toxicity associated with antisense molecules that have been observed in vitro and in vivo, they have been chemically modified to improve their target binding affinity and to prevent nuclease degradation. As one example, incorporation of an entirely phosphorothioate (P=S) backbone and incorporation of 2'-methyoxyethyl modifications on the terminal (5' and 3' ends) bases gives nuclease resistance and increased mRNA binding while permitting RNase-mediated degradation [1][2] . Much longer studied than RNA inteference, there is already one antisense oligonucleotide product approved for local therapy of cytomegalovirus retinitis (Vitravene) and nearly twenty others in late-stage clinical trials and development targeting, among others, bcl-2, PKC-α, and DNA methyltransferase.\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides have not developed into ubiquitous molecular therapeutics as was initially hoped. Despite the successes mentioned above, folding of target RNAs and/or their association with specific proteins in the cell often prevent the antisense molecules from binding to their targets. This requires employment of relatively high doses in order to achieve a therapeutic effect; these high doses, as well as the consequently high toxicity that is sometimes observed, have made antisense molecules less than ideal for therapeutic product development. As discussed below, the discovery of RNA interference, requiring double-stranded RNA, demonstrates greatly enhanced potency and thus is attracting a great deal of interest as a possible improvement upon/successor to antisense.\n\nThe phenomenon of double-stranded RNA-(dsRNA-)induced gene silencing that we now call RNA interference (RNAi) emerged from studies dating back to the 1980s. It was initially observed in plants that introduction of exogenous \"transgenes\" could alter the levels of expression of endogenous genes that possessed some amount of sequence homology; this was termed \"homology-dependent gene silencing\" (HDGS) 3 . Further work suggested that HDGS was found in a wide variety of organisms [4][5] and that it could be correlated to covalent modifications of genomic DNA, particularly methylation of cytosine residues 6 , which can lead to conversion to thymidine 7 . Interestingly, the effect of methylation was different depending on the region of the gene being methylatedmethylation of promoter sequences led to transcription silencing [8][9] (\"transcriptional gene silencing,\" TGS), while methylation of the coding sequence corresponds to mRNA destabilization (\"post-transcriptional gene silencing,\" PTGS).\n\nIt wasn't until some investigations in worms (C. elegans) in the 1990s that RNA was shown to trigger gene silencing in an inheritable manner. Both sense and antisense RNAs, when injected separately, were equally effective at silencing homologous target genes 10 .\n\nThe seminal discovery following this was made by Fire and Mello, who demonstrated that the combination of sense and antisense RNAs (essentially dsRNA) together gave greater than ten times down-regulation than either RNA alone 11 . It was this finding that led to the realization that RNA was responsible for the HDGS phenomena observed up to a decade earlier and sparked the cascade of research on RNAi in mammalian cells that continues to grow.\n\nInitial in vitro investigations of RNAi showed that RNAi-induced silencing was realized via degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) 12 . An assembly of the dsRNA with a nuclease to form a \"RNA-induced silencing complex\" (RISC) was observed. After extracts from RNAi-induced cells were shown to possess discrete ~25 nt RNAs homologous to the target gene, it was discovered shortly thereafter that these RNAs cofractionated with the RISC [13][14] . A critical extension was made in cell-free systems by Zamore and co-workers who determined that cell extracts contained the ability to process dsRNA into 22-nt effector\n\nRNAs termed \"small interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs) 15 .\n\nQuickly, more became known about the details of RISC, both its protein and nucleic acid components. Having a total size of ~500 kDa, the RISC was shown to contain the Argonaute-2 (Ago-2) protein and a family of RNase III proteins called Dicer 16 . Dicer contains dual RNase III domains and dsRNA-binding motifs; it processes dsRNA into siRNAs and is recruited into the RISC by association between the PAZ domains found on both Dicer and Ago-2 17 . A detailed description of the current understanding of RISC formation is shown in  Despite having developed this understanding of the key players and mechanism of RNAi, a significant hurdle remained to the development of RNAi as a research and therapeutic tool. The long dsRNA molecules that were cleaved into siRNA by Dicer are known to also interact with other cellular proteins that cause undesired, interferon-regulated responses (Fig. 1.2). One of these proteins, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, binds to and is activated by dsRNAs longer than 30 bp in length, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and global translational arrest 19-20 . Another, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, is activated by dsRNA and causes non-specific mRNA degradation via 2',5'-oligoadenylate-activated ribonuclease L 21 . A critical breakthrough came when Elbashir and co-workers generated synthetic siRNAs (21-nt duplexes having symmetric 2-nt 3' overhangs) and demonstrated that these could perform RNAi without needing cleavage by Dicer and without generating a PKR/interferon response 23 . This finding opened the floodgates as the number of experimenters working with siRNA, and related small hairpin RNA (shRNA), has proliferated. Today it is one of, if not the most, commonly used techniques to reduce levels of a particular gene to study its function or to elucidate a drug target.\n\nFirst discovered in C. elegans in 1993, small temporal RNAs (stRNAs), now known as microRNAs (miRNAs), are endogenous RNAs that accomplish targeted gene downregulation in a manner very similar to that of siRNA. Sharing part of the mechanism of RNA interference described above, miRNAs have contributed significantly to the understanding of RNAi and its role in cellular and developmental biology.\n\nThe first step of miRNA maturation is the nuclear cleavage of a primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) to liberate a ~60 -70 nt stem loop intermediate called the pre-miRNA (miRNA precursor) 24 . This cleavage is performed by the nuclear enzyme Drosha, an\n\nRNase III endonuclease (just like Dicer), and generates a 5' phosphate and 2-nt 3' overhang on the stem-loop 25 . Exportin-5 and Ran-GTP then transport the pre-miRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the second end of the mature miRNA is generated by Dicer, the same enzyme implicated in the generation of siRNA. It is worth noting that the specificity of the initial cleavage (mediated by Drosha in the nucleus)\n\ndetermines the correct register of cleavage within the pre-miRNA and thus defines both mature ends of the miRNA 26 . This stands in contrast to the non-specific, progressive cleavages seen with Dicer. Indeed, it has very recently been shown that small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), 29-nt stem loop analogues of pri-miRNAs, also demonstrate a unique cleavage product that can be predicted 27   Despite their functional similarity to siRNAs, miRNAs differ from siRNAs in regard to their origin, evolutionary conservation, and the types of genes they silence 28 . Whereas endogenous siRNAs are often derived from mRNAs, viruses, or transposons, miRNAs derive from loci that are unique for other recognized genes. While endogenous siRNA sequences are rarely conserved, miRNA sequences are nearly always conserved among related organisms. Finally, endogenous siRNAs \"auto-silence,\" i.e., they silence genes at the same locus, or very similar loci, from which they originate. In contrast, miRNAs \"hetero-silence\" genes that are very different from their own origination.\n\nThe seminal work with synthetic siRNA duplexes by Elbashir and colleagues demonstrated that 21-nt RNA (phosphodiester) duplexes with symmetric 2-nt, 3' overhangs (either DNA or RNA) were sufficient to perform sequence-specific RNAi in mammalian cells 23 . Since this initial discovery, a large body of work has been performed to investigate the tolerance for chemical modifications at all possible locations with these duplexes, including the termini and the backbones.\n\nA variety of modifications to the termini of siRNA duplexes, and their effect, if any, on their potency, have been examined. It is clear that a 5'phosphate group is required on the antisense strand for mRNA cleavage; this requirement does not extend to the sense strand 30- 31 . However, phosphorylation of a 5' hydroxyl group on the antisense strand is performed by an intracellular kinase, so synthetic siRNA duplexes need not possess a 5' phosphate group on the antisense strand. As long as the 5' phosphodiester linkage is maintained on the antisense strand, further modifications (e.g., incorporation of a fluorophore) to the antisense strand are tolerated 30,32 . Many modifications to the 3' end of antisenses strand are permitted without loss of potency (e.g., an inverted deoxy abasic residue 33 , puromycin or biotin 34 , or a dideoxycytosine (ddC) 31 ), but a couple of alternations have abrogated RNAi activity (2-hydroxyethylphosphate or 2'-O,4'-C-ethylene thymidine 35 ). While the TAT peptide or a TAT-derived oligocarbamate could be conjugated to the 3' end of the antisense strand without compromising silencing activity 36 , fluorophore conjugation to this terminus (but not any others within the siRNA duplex) did abolish gene silencing 32 .\n\nMany experiments have been performed to understand the effect of interior modifications of siRNA duplexes and, in general, the results and conclusions are variable. Two groups showed that the silencing activity of siRNA duplexes containing phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages (instead of phosphodiester (P=O)) was unaffected by this modification 32,37 .\n\nHowever, another group showed that P=S modification did indeed reduce siRNA activity 38 .\n\nIncorporation of a boranophosphonate (P=B) backbone within T7-synthesized duplexes (containing 5' triphosphates) was better tolerated in the sense strand than antisense strand, and modification at the terminal regions of the strands only permitted retained activity of extended duration 39 . Some sugar modifications, including 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro (2'-F) and locked nucleic acid (LNA), have been shown to improve target binding affinity, and 2'-F siRNA shows enhanced serum stability but gives provides only comparable activity to unmodified duplexes in vivo 40 .\n\nAs an alternative to the more costly chemical synthesis of siRNA duplexes, many researchers have generated siRNA through in vitro transcription (IVT) methods. This is generally done using bacteriophage promoters with (linearized) DNA templates, and the most common system employed (using the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase) produces very potent siRNAs [41][42] . However, it was demonstrated that T7-synthesized siRNAs are potent inducers of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) in numerous cell lines; singlestranded oligos made in the same way generated similar responses 43 . In fact, the presence of a 5' triphosphate on these RNAs was implicated in this interferon response, leading to the development of an alternative IVT system that incorporates two 3' adenosines 43 . These adenosines prevent base-pairing with the initiating guanosines, thereby allowing the initiating 5' nucleotides and triphosphates to be removed (by CIP and RNase T1). This discovery should be considered when evaluating both the potency and immunogenicity of IVT siRNAs in previously-published and forthcoming reports.\n\nAs we continue to learn more about the mechanism of RNAi and the similarity in processing between endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) and exogenous dsRNA, the evolutionary purpose of the phenomenon of RNAi is a subject of much interest. Indeed, at least three distinct roles of RNAi have been identified and are discussed briefly here: antiviral response, protection of the genome, and regulation of development.\n\nWhile dsRNA is not a participant in the central dogma of cell biology, the genetic material of numerous viruses is either directly packaged as dsRNA or its intracellular processing proceeds through a dsRNA intermediate.\n\nIt is logical, therefore, that cells have evolved a capacity to recognize dsRNA as foreign material and developed mechanisms for protection. Indeed, interferon responses and apoptosis mediated through dsRNA-mediated binding of cellular proteins, such as Toll-like receptor 3, protein kinase (PKR) or 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-AS), are clear examples of this. Research on plants has also shown that genes implicated in RNAi are essential for viral protection; for example, Arabidoposis mutants in RNAi genes (sgs2 or sgs3) show hypersensitivity to infection by the cucumovirus 44 . Perhaps RNAi evolution extends cellular protection to include shorter viral dsRNA triggers that complement the larger ones recognized by the other proteins mentioned above. All complex genomes contain unstable elements (transposons), often possessing repetitive sequences, whose motility can contribute to genomic mutagenesis. There is evidence that RNAi-deficient worms (C. elegans) show increased rates of transposition 45 . Also, sequencing of ~22-nt siRNAs has uncovered guide sequences corresponding to endogenous transposons that move via both RNA and DNA intermediates in Drosophila 46 . These observations raise the possibility that RNAi has evolved to protect organisms from endogenous parasitic nucleic acids, such as transposons.\n\nA third role of RNAi is suggested to be within organism developmental control. Mutations to Dicer or Argonaute-2 analogs in Arabidopsis led to stem cell defects causing developmental abnormalities or even embryo lethality [47][48] . Worms that are defective in either of those genes, as well as the miRNA let-7, show similar phenotypes, including abnormal oocytes and the inability to fertilize eggs. Thus the link between control of development timing and RNAi is clear and will likely continue to become better understood.\n\nA number of publications have come out that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RNAi in animals, particularly mice. Perhaps the most commonly examined therapeutic application of RNAi has been cancer, often owing to the specificity of the mutated gene target within cancer cells (and not others) and the relative ease of targeting these cells, which frequently over-express particular cell surface receptors. Non-targeted DOTAPbased liposomes have been used to deliver siRNA targeting the c-raf oncogene to human breast xenograft tumors in mice, resulting in 73% suppression of tumor growth 49 .\n\nUntargeted polyethylenimine-(PEI-)siRNA complexes reduced the growth of subcutaneous SKOV-3 tumor xenografts in athymic mice due to specific HER-2 downregulation 50 . Finally, the use of PEI-siRNA complexes that were PEGylated and targeted to integrins (at sites of neovasculature) via an RGD peptide reduced levels of EGFR and provided correspondingly reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth 51 .\n\nMany non-cancer therapeutic applications of siRNA have been demonstrated as well.\n\nRetro-orbital injection of PEI-formulated siRNA against influenza virus inhibits viral production in virus-infected mice 52 . Systemic (intravenous) injection of polymer-bound siRNA against VEGF pathway genes reduces ocular angiogenesis 53 . Electroporation of human livers cells with siRNA targeting the hepatic C genome (ssRNA) sharply reduced virus-specific protein expression and RNA synthesis 54 .\n\nThese successful experimental results and others like them indicate that the therapeutic potential of RNAi is high and may be realized soon. However, the known immunogenicity and/or toxicity of the non-viral vectors in these reports warrants investigation of alternative siRNA delivery systems that overcome these obstacles.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Investigation of siRNA Immunogenicity\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) has rapidly become the method of choice for the elucidation of gene function and the identification of drug targets. However, some recent reports suggest that small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes that perform RNAi may induce an immune response in cells that take them up, most notably upregulating type I interferons (IFNs).\n\nSuch immunogenicity would render therapeutic in vivo applications of siRNA unsafe for the patient and would preclude investigation of our polymeric system to deliver these duplexes. However, the generality of the conclusions of these reports have been questioned\n\nfor a variety of reasons, including the means of generation of the duplexes themselves, the lack of in vivo results to support these claims (only cell culture results were included), the use of a delivery vehicle for all samples (siRNA alone samples were not included), and the relatively high dose of siRNA employed. Here, we carefully examine whether or not naked synthetic siRNA duplexes themselves induce a cytokine response, both in cultured cells and in mice. Our results suggest that, even when administered in vivo by hydrodynamic delivery such that these naked siRNAs enter cells and are efficacious, synthetic siRNA duplexes do not induce a detectable immune response. Our findings have very recently been confirmed by multiple other researchers. From these results, we conclude that synthetic siRNA duplexes may indeed be safe for in vivo applications, and the ability of our polymeric system to deliver them merits exploration.\n\nFirst discovered in plants two decades ago, the phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) has rapidly become the method of choice for the elucidation of gene function and the identification of drug targets in mammalian cells. RNAi is achieved by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that triggers recognition and cleavage of the corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) within the cytoplasm of cells.\n\nAn intracellular enzyme (Dicer) cuts dsRNA into duplexes (21-23 nucleotoides (nt) in length) that are suitable for interaction with RISC. While dsRNA larger than 21-23 nt in length may be appropriately Diced, it has been demonstrated in mammalian cells that dsRNA longer than 30 nt triggers a non-specific interferon pathway (through interaction with the protein kinase PKR 1 and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 ) rather than RNAi. In fact, small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes 21-23 nt in length can bypass Dicer and induce RNAi by incorporating within RISC directly, thereby eliminating the PKR/interferon response 3,4 . Thus, although additional work has been done with both plasmids that express siRNAs and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) showing their suitability for RNAi, synthetic siRNA duplexes are preferred for most common, transient applications.\n\nWhile numerous reports have come out demonstrating the efficacy of siRNA duplexes to down-regulate a variety of targets in cultured cell lines, there have also been some reports of adverse effects of siRNA on cells that take them up. Most notably, it has been claimed that siRNAs, while small enough to avoid interaction with PKR, activate an interferon response in a sequence-independent matter [5][6][7] . If this were generally true, the potential of siRNA as a therapeutic would be sharply reduced, if not completely eliminated.\n\nCareful inspection of these reports, however, suggests that all siRNA may not be immunogenic under all conditions. For example, the siRNA examined was generated from a variety of sources, including chemical synthesis, processing of shRNA, and in vitro (T7) transcription. Also, work was done in cultured cell models only (no in vivo results) and concentrations much higher than may be necessary for down-regulation (up to 100 nM) were employed. Finally, all exposures to siRNA were performed in the presence of a delivery vector, either liposomal or viral in nature, which complicates interpretation of the results.\n\nPrior to exploration of whether our polymer-based system might be suitable for siRNA delivery, we decided to expand on the previous work investigating the interferon response to siRNA. Since our delivery system has previously been shown to be non-toxic and welltolerated in mice 8 , we first investigated whether or not chemically synthesized siRNAs alone (without a delivery vector) elicit a cytokine response in cultured cells and in mice; for in vivo experiments, three different means of administration were compared. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that chemically synthesized siRNAs do not elicit an immune response in mice, even when administered under conditions that permit them to be taken up by cells and perform detectable down-regulation of a target gene.\n\nPoly(I:C) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. siRNA duplexes against luciferase (\"siGL3\"), FAS (\"siFAS\"), c-Myc (\"siCMYC\"), and a non-targeting control duplex (\"siCNTL\") were purchased from Dharmacon. All came purified and pre-annealed by the manufacturer (\"Option C\"). Sequences:\n\nThe luciferase-encoding plasmid (containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the human α 1 -antitrypsin promoter and the apolipoprotein E locus control region) was a generous gift of A. McCaffrey and M. Kay. Where indicated, nucleic acids were preincubated with 50 µg/mL RNase (Roche) at 37 o C for 30 min prior to use.\n\nRAW-264.7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heatinactivated) and 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic (penicillin, streptomycin, and amphoterecin B). 5 x 10 6 cells were plated per well of a 24-well plate in medium containing 1.2% DMSO.\n\nAfter 24 h, mIFN-γ (Sigma) was added for 8 h to stimulate TLR3 expression.\n\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma, 1 µg/well), poly(I:C), or siRNA (siGL3) in indicated doses was added directly to appropriate wells for 24 h prior to harvesting the supernatant.\n\nIL-12(p40) levels were measured by ELISA (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFemale BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were treated according to the NIH Guidelines for Animal Care and as approved by the Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were 6-8 weeks of age at the time of injection. siRNA was formulated in D5W (5% (50 mg/mL) glucose in water) such that a 10% (vol/wt) injection provided a 2.5 mg/kg dose, unless otherwise indicated. Mouse tails were warmed with a heating pad prior to injection of a 0.2-mL (for \"low-pressure\") or a 2-mL (for \"highpressure\") volume (per 20-g mouse) over ~3-5 sec. For co-injections of siRNA with plasmid DNA, 0.25 mg/kg DNA was delivered with 2.5 mg/kg of the appropriate siRNA.\n\nTo determine luciferase levels, 0.2 mL of a 15 mg/mL solution of D-luciferin (Xenogen; in PBS) was injected intraperitoneally 10 min prior to imaging. To measure plasma cytokine levels, blood was harvested from mice 2 h post-injection by cardiac puncture, and plasma was isolated using Microtainer tubes (Becton Dickinson). [In preliminary experiments comparing the IL-12 response at 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h, post-injection, the maximum response was consistently observed at 2 h; therefore, data from the 2 h timepoint is used here.] IL-12(p40) and IFN-α levels (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure FAS mRNA levels, total RNA was isolated from ~100 mg of liver tissue using the FastRNA Pro Green Kit (Qbiogene)\n\nand FastPrep Instrument (Qbiogene) for 40 sec at a speed setting of 6.0.\n\n1 µg total RNA was first digested with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) and then reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA using oligo-dT and Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers were designed with\n\nPoly(inosinic acid:cytidylic acid) (poly(I:C)), an analog of RNA, was included in these  Poly(I:C) is clearly very polydisperse, generating a broad smear even without exposure to  response. In contrast, synthetic siRNA failed to induce a measureable IL-12 response at any dose. Pre-treatment of poly(I:C) with RNase completed abrogated the IL-12 response.\n\nThe effect of siRNA on IL-12 secretion was further examined in female BALB/c mice.\n\nAdministrations of synthetic siRNA duplexes or poly(I:C) were performed as intraperitoneal (IP) injections or via the tail vein using either 'low-pressure' (LPTV, 1%  ELISA analyses of plasma IL-12 levels show, for each of the three different injection types, a strong induction by poly(I:C) that is absent with either a synthetic siRNA against FAS, c-MYC, or luciferase (siFAS, siCMYC, siGL3), or RNase-treated poly(I:C), even when the siFAS dose is increased up to threefold. In addition to determining IL-12 concentrations, these experiments allow us to test for interferon responses. The plasma levels of IFN-α in BALB/c mice exposed to siRNA (siFAS, siGL3, or siCMYC) or poly(I:C) were measured by ELISA (Fig. 2.4). As was observed with IL-12, each siRNA failed to elicit an IFN-α response whereas poly(I:C) induced a strong response that was eliminated by pre-treatment with RNase.\n\nFurther, injected synthetic siRNAs (siFAS and siCMYC) failed to induce any significant changes in critical blood chemistry or liver enzyme levels except for the cases where the HPTV method of injection is used (Fig. (d) White blood cells (WBCs). For all panels, mice were injected with 5% (wt/vol) glucose in water (D5W) or 2.5 mg/kg indicated nucleic acids (in D5W) either intraperitoneally (IP) or through the tail vein via low-pressure (1% vol/wt, LPTV) or high-pressure (10% vol/wt, HPTV). Blood was collected 2 h post-injection. Whole blood was used to determine PLT and WBC levels, while plasma was isolated and used to determine ALT and ALKP levels. The average of three replicate mice is presented, and error bars represent one standard deviation.\n\nFinally, since there is the possibility that the PKR response in BALB/c mice may be compromised relative to other mouse strains 13 , some of the cytokine investigation experiments (originally performed with BALB/c mice) were reproduced in C57BL/6 mice, which are fully immunocompetent. The results show that the effects observed are consistent within these two strains (Fig. 2.4.3. Synthetic siRNA achieves sequence-specific gene knockdown in cultured cells While these results support the hypothesis that naked, synthetic siRNA duplexes do not induce an immune response in mice, further experimentation to verify nucleic acid stability and intracellular localization in the mice is necessary. A synthetic siRNA duplex (siCNTL) was exposed to active mouse serum for up to 8 h and then examined for degradation via agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2.7). This result indicates that some of the siRNA is still intact after exposure to serum for 2 h, which is the timeframe at which an IL-12 response was investigated in mice (see Fig. 2.3).\n\nFurther, siRNA duplexes have been shown to achieve down-regulation of genes for several days in cultured cells 14 . When synthetic siRNA targeting luciferase (siGL3) is co-delivered with a luciferase-encoding plasmid (pGL3CV) to RAW-264.  2.4.4 Synthetic siRNA achieves sequence-specific gene knockdown in mice Additionally, we injected BALB/c mice with a luciferase-containing plasmid (encoding the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the liver-specific hAAT promoter with ApoE HCR enchancer, pApoEHCRLuc) alone or co-injected this plasmid with siRNA that contains the appropriate sequence to perform luciferase down-regulation (siGL3) or an unrelated sequence (siCNTL); all injections were HPTV. The in vivo luciferase expression  The cumulative signal from each mouse was quantified at each time point, and the results   2 d 4 d 6 d 9 d 13 d\n\nMice co-injected with the luciferase-targeting siRNA display a significant (P < 0.1 or better for all time points) down-regulation of luciferase expression that is not observed with the control siRNA. The sequence-specific RNAi demonstrates that intact siRNA do reach intracellular targets and are functional in vivo at the conditions of our studies.\n\nA second efficacy experiment in mice showed that HPTV injection of siFAS reduces the level of FAS mRNA in mouse liver (Fig. 2.11). Both of these experiments demonstrate that, at least when delivered under these conditions, synthetic siRNA can be efficacious in vivo. Thus the HPTV method of administering siRNA used here for examination of immunogenicity also provides for cellular uptake and gene down-regulation in the livers of mice\n\n14,16-17 . Given the stability and efficacy of multiple siRNAs, the lack of IL-12 and IFN-α expression obtained in mice suggests that * 0.000 0.200 0.400 0.600 0.800 1.000 1.200 1.400 Uninjected siFAS, LPTV siFAS, HPTV (Fas mRNA)/(Actin mRNA)\n\nsynthetic siRNAs used in this study do not elicit an observable immune response when administered naked by LPTV, HPTV, or IP methods in the amounts used here.\n\nBecause small interfering RNA (siRNA) has shown impressive efficacy for downregulation of a target mRNA in a number of different cell lines and in vivo models, it has tremendous potential for development into a therapeutic. However, some published reports have linked siRNA with off-target gene down-regulation and immunogenicity. The objective of the work in this chapter is to determine whether or not synthetic siRNA duplexes are indeed immunostimulatory, both in cultured cells and in mice, prior to investigation of our polymeric system to deliver them.\n\nIn cultured cells, there are reports of non-specific gene target effects that include off-target gene suppression and upregulation of type I interferons (IFNs) [5][6][7][18][19] . Hypotheses for the mechanism belying this IFN response include recognition of the siRNA by Toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3) and 9 (TLR9) and/or induction of protein kinase PKR pathways. When we applied naked synthetic siRNA to cultured cells known to be responsive to the downstream target of TLR3 and TLR9 signaling, the transcription factor NFκB, we failed to observe a cytokine response. PKR is known to recognize dsRNA molecules of at least ~30 bp in length 1 ; the synthetic duplexes we examined here should all be too small to trigger an PKR response. The cytokine response induced by poly(inosinic acid:cytidylic acid) (poly(I:C)), a large analog of RNA that is known to elicit an immune response in mice [20][21] , could be eliminated by pre-treatment with RNase.\n\nIt is known that TLR3 is located both on the cell surface and intracellularly in human fibroblasts but remains intracellular in others, such as monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells 22 . CpG-containing oligonucleotide/TLR9 interactions require internalization of the nucleic acid with TLR9-bearing cells 23 . Thus, proof of nucleic acid stability and intracellular localization in the mice are necessary. We showed that ~50% of synthetic siRNA remains intact upon exposure to active mouse serum of 2 h. This suggests that the lack of plasma cytokine (IL-12, IFN-α) responses seen in mice 2 h after injection with siRNA is truly the result of intact siRNA failing to trigger any response. Further, in showing down-regulation of both exogenous (luciferase) and endogenous (FAS) targets after injection of synthetic siRNA in mice, we demonstrate the efficacy of these duplexes in vivo under our experimental conditions. The down-regulation of FAS observed upon 'highpressure' tail vein (HPTV) injection was not seen upon 'low-pressure' injection (LPTV) of the same siRNA at the same dose, consistent with previous observations that high-pressure is required to achieve down-regulation of a target gene by naked siRNA in mice, even if the siRNA is chemically stabilized 14 .\n\nThere is the possibility that the PKR response in BALB/c mice may be compromised relative to other mouse strains 13 . Researchers have shown IL-12 responses to poly(I:C) in vitro with RAW-264.7 cells and in serum after IP injection in C57BL/6 mice like those shown here with the same cell line and BALB/c mice 24 . We reproduced some of our experiments performed with the BALB/c mice in C57BL/6 mice, and the results show that the effects observed are consistent within those two strains.\n\nIn conclusion, we examined the response of mice to naked siRNAs. Plasma IL-12 and IFN-α levels that were observed in mice by injection of poly(I:C) (used as a positive control) were not obtained with siRNA. Pre-digestion of poly(I:C) with RNase abrogated these responses. Co-injection of siRNA and a luciferase-expressing plasmid into mice followed by in vivo whole-animal imaging confirms the uptake and sequence-specific function of injected synthetic siRNA. HPTV injection of siRNA alone was also shown to down-regulate an endogenous target gene (FAS) in mice. Taken together, the results contained within this chapter suggest that synthetic siRNAs are well tolerated in mice and that it is indeed possible for siRNAs to down-regulate targets in vivo without stimulating an interferon response.\n\nFinally, very recently, the lack of immunogenicity seen here with naked synthetic siRNAs has been confirmed by multiple other researchers [25][26] , further strengthening the claim made here that synthetic siRNAs may be safe and efficacious for applications in animals. There have been additional reports that particular motifs within siRNA duplexes endow them with sequence-specific immunogenicity [25][26][27][28] . This issue, in the context of our polymeric delivery system, will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.\n\nThe synthesis and characterization of cyclodextrin-containing polycations (CDPs), the first polycations designed specifically for the delivery of DNA, have been described 1 .\n\nSystematic investigations of modifications in the presence and type of sugar and the type of and spacing between charge centers have led to a thorough understanding of the effects of these parameters on the gene delivery efficiency and toxicity of polymer-DNA complexes (\"polyplexes\") [2][3][4] . From these and other studies 5 , an amine-terminated, β-cyclodextrin-(β-CD-)containing polymer possessing cationic amidine groups separated by six methylene groups emerged as a leading candidate for further development (Fig. 3.1a). While transfection with polyplexes made with this amine-terminated polymer generated levels of gene expression in cultured cells comparable to that seen with the best commercially-available polycation and lipid reagents 1,6 , microscopic analysis of transfected cells suggested that the majority of intracellular polyplexes were sequestered within endosomal vesicles [6][7] . These vesicles are known to acidify within the cell and ultimately fuse with lysosomes, leading to degradation of intravesicular contents. Modification of polymer termini to contain imidazole (Im) moieties (Fig.  While they are potent gene delivery systems in cultured cells, these CDP-containing polyplexes readily aggregate at physiological conditions, owing to their positively-charged colloidal nature 8 . This problem of polyplex aggregation is most commonly overcome by covalent modification of polyplexes with a neutral polymer, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). While it is possible to perform this covalent PEGylation and not disrupt polyplexes 9 , others have reported that this modification alters polyplex morphologies 10 or even prevents DNA condensation 11 ; similar difficulties were observed with covalently PEGylated CDP 8 . However, the unique structure of β-CD allows for a novel approach to the PEGylation of CDP-containing polyplexes. PEG is tethered to a small molecule, adamantane (AD), that is known to form strong, non-covalent inclusion complexes with β-CD 12  Indeed, unlike their unPEGylated counterparts, CDP-containing polyplexes modified with AD-PEG retain their as-formulated size when exposed to salt 8 (Fig. 3.3c). Measurements were made in water for 30-sec periods over 2 min, then 0.11 volumes of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) were added to bring the solution to a 1 x (150 mM) final concentration. Measurements were continued for an additional 2.5 min. While a steady increase in size was seen for unPEGylated polyplexes after the addition of salt, the size of PEGylated polyplexes remained stable.\n\nCDP-containing polyplexes can be further modified to incorporate a targeting ligand to direct their selective uptake by particular cell types. For example, transferrin (Tf) can be introduced through synthesis of an AD-PEG-Tf conjugate; this conjugate had been shown to enhance polyplex uptake by cells that express high levels of the cell-surface transferrin receptor (TfR) [13][14] .\n\nWhile much work has already been done to better understand this CDP system, there still remain a number of unanswered questions regarding the exact composition and nature of CDP-containing polyplexes. The amount and effect of unbound (i.e., not within polyplexes) material within polyplex formulations remain heretofore undetermined.\n\nQuantification of AD-PEG binding to polyplexes and its effect on cellular uptake warrant investigation. Further, all of the developmental work discussed above was done in the context of DNA, almost exclusively with relatively large (~3-10 kbp) plasmids. It remains to be determined if polyplexes can be prepared with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes and, if so, how the polyplex properties might be affected. All of these issues are addressed in Chapter 3.\n\nA gel retardation assay is employed to demonstrate that an equivalent amount of imidazole- siGL3 or pDNA (5 µL) 0 0 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 0.5 0.1106 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 1 0.2212 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 1.5 0.3318 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 2 0.4424 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 2.5 0.553 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 3 0.6636 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 3.5 0.7742 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 4 0.8848 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 4.5 0.9954 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL 5 1.106 mg/mL 0.1 mg/mL\n\nA CDP solution (in distilled water) was added to an equal volume containing 2 µg of pDNA or siRNA at a charge ratio of 3/1 +/-. While the charge ratio was fixed, four different concentration combinations of CDP and nucleic acid were examined:\n\nSol'n CDP pGL3CV or siGL3 H 2 O A 20 µL @ 0.6636 mg/mL 20 µL @ 0.1 mg/mL 1160 µL B 50 µL @ 0.2654 mg/mL 50 µL @ 0.04 mg/mL 1100 µL C 100 µL @ 0.1327 mg/mL 100 µL @ 0.02 mg/mL 1000 µL D 600 µL @ 0.02212 mg/mL 600 µL @ 0.00333 mg/mL (0 µL)\n\nThe resulting solutions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow polyplex formation. An appropriate volume of distilled water (indicated in the above table) was then added to give a total sample volume of 1200 µL.\n\nFor formulations PEGylated after polyplex formation (\"post-PEGylated\"), an appropriate amount of an AD-PEG solution (4.95 µL of a 20 mg/mL AD-PEG solution, corresponding to a 1:1 molar ratio of AD:β-CD) was added prior to \"voluming up\" to a total sample volume of 1200 µL with water.\n\nFor formulations PEGylated before polyplex formation (\"pre-PEGylated\"), an appropriate amount of an AD-PEG solution (4.95 µL of a 20 mg/mL AD-PEG solution, corresponding to a 1:1 molar ratio of AD:β-CD) was added to CDP. The resulting CDP/AD-PEG solution was added to the nucleic acid solution and subsequently \"volumed up\" to a total sample volume of 1200 µL with water.\n\nPolyplex solutions were loaded into polystyrene cuvettes and polyplex size (effective hydrodynamic diameter) was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a ZetaPALS (Brookhaven Instruments) instrument. Ten successive measurements of 30 sec each were performed. For appropriate samples, 600 µL phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) solution was added after the fifth measurement. After measuring polyplex size, the surface charge (zeta potential) of polyplex solutions was subsequently measured using the same instrument (Smoluchowski method, 10 runs, target residual = 0.05, pH = 6.0, SR-101 (solvent-resistant) device).\n\nHeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1 x antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). 5 x 10 4 cells were plated in 1 mL growth medium per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate 24 h prior to transfection. UnPEGylated CDP/FL-siRNA polyplexes containing 1 µg siRNA at a charge ratio of 3/1 (+/-) were prepared as described above. For flow cytometry, cells were detached with trypsin and rinsed twice with PBS (containing 0.1% BSA), prior to analysis using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). For laser scanning confocal microsopy, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 100 mM HEPES for 15 min. Following two more PBS washes, cells were left in PBS, and microscopy was conducted using a Zeiss 410 laser scanning confocal microscope.\n\nFor each sample, 5 µL of active mouse serum (Sigma) was added to an equal volume of water containing 40 pmol siGL3, either naked or within CDP-containig polyplexes (3/1 (+/-) charge ratio); serum was added either before or after a 4 h incubation at 37 o C, as indicated. Following this incubation, 2 µL of loading buffer (0.03% bromophenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol FF, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA) were added to each solution, and 10 µL (of a total of 12 µL) of the resulting solutions were loaded per well of a 15% polyacrylamide gel in 1 x TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA). The gel was electrophoresed at 100 V for 75 min, then incubated in 50 mL 1 x TBE buffer containing 0.1 µg/mL ethidium bromide with gentle shaking for 30 min to allow visualization.\n\npDNA-containing or siRNA-containing polyplexes were prepared using 1 µg nucleic acid and an amine-terminated CDP at various charge ratios. To each 100-µL polyplex solution, 575 µL water and 75 µL 10 x PBS was added, giving a final 750-µL solution of polyplexes in 1 X PBS. These solutions were centrifuged at 20,800*g for 99 min to pellet aggregated polyplexes. 500 µL of each supernatant was then used for determination of unbound CDP via end-group analysis (amine quantification) using a TNBS assay as described previously 21 . Using a CDP standard curve, the amount of free CDP for the entire sample was calculated and subtracted from the total CDP to determine the amount of CDP bound.\n\nThis mass of CDP was converted to an equivalent charge ratio, an \"effective polyplex charge ratio\" (EPCR), as described above.\n\nAll calorimetric measurements were performed using a MCS ITC calorimeter (Microcal) provided by the manufacturer, this data was regressed to give best-fit values for stoichiometry (n; number of ligand binding sites), binding strength (K; M -1 ), and enthalpy of binding (∆H; kcal/mol of injectant).\n\nPolyplexes were made with 1 µg pDNA and amine-terminated CDP at a charge ratio of 3/1 (+/-) as described above. To each 200-µL polyplex solution, 20 µL of water or an AD-PEG solution (to give 1:1 AD:β-CD (\"100%\") or 3:1 AD:β-CD (\"300%\") was added.\n\nThen 1000 µL PBS was added, and resulting solutions were incubated at 37 o C for 1 h.\n\nSolution absorbance at 405 nm (A405) was then measured.\n\nGiven the electrostatic basis of interaction between our cyclodextrin-containing polycation (CDP), we hypothesized that the amounts of CDP required to bind siRNA would be similar to that observed previously with pDNA 1 . For each of these two nucleic acid types, samples were prepared in which increasing concentrations of CDP were added to a given concentration of nucleic acid. The resulting solutions were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide (for siRNA-containing samples) or an agarose (for pDNA-containing samples) gel (Fig. 3.4). Increasing amounts of CDP were added to 0.5 µg of (a) pDNA or (b) siRNA, and resulting solutions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. For both nucleic acids, complete retardation was observed for all charge ratios greater than 1 +/-.\n\nUnbound nucleic acids can migrate freely through the gel, whereas CDP-bound nucleic acids are trapped within the wells into which they are loaded. For both pDNA and siRNA, as soon as the amount of CDP added created a positive (i.e., greater than 1/1 +/-) charge ratio, all nucleic acids remained within the wells. This observation suggests that, analogous to what has been seen here and previously with pDNA, formulation of siRNA with CDP at a positive charge ratio is sufficient to condense all siRNA within polyplexes.\n\nBecause the molecular weight of the siRNA examined here (~1 x 10  The size of pDNA-containing polyplexes, all of which were prepared at the same charge ratio (3 +/-), shows a strong dependence on concentration. The more concentrated the components are at the time of formulation, the larger the diameters of the resulting polyplexes. These results suggest that, as formulation concentrations increase, the number densities and/or mass densities of the polyplexes decrease.\n\nPrevious work with CDP/pDNA polyplexes has shown that addition of an adamantanepoly(ethylene glycol) (AD-PEG) conjugate confers stability when polyplexes are exposed to salt 8 . After adding CDP to siRNA to form polyplexes, DLS was used to monitor polyplex size both in water and after addition of salt (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS); these results are compared to those for CDP/pDNA polyplexes and to those to which AD-PEG was added (Fig. As is seen for polyplexes containing pDNA, AD-PEG confers salt stability to CDP/siRNA polyplexes.\n\nWe have previously observed for DNA-containing polyplexes that addition of AD-PEG to CDP prior to polyplex formation (\"pre-PEGylation\") eliminates the concentration dependence on size that is seen for unPEGylated polyplexes (see Fig.\n\nOur previous work with CDP/pDNA polyplexes has shown high levels of cellular uptake when they are exposed to adherent cells in culture 7 . Here, polyplexes were prepared with CDP and siRNA duplexes that were covalently modified to contain fluorescein at their 5' ends (FL-siRNA). Uptake of these polyplexes was assessed through examination of cellular fluorescence by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy (Fig.\n\n3.8). Negative control samples, uncomplexed FL-siRNA and polyplexes containing unlabeled siRNA, induced negligible (<1%) increases in cellular fluorescence relative to the untreated cells. However, CDP/FL-siRNA polyplexes caused significant fluorescent signal in virtually all (>99%) cells that were exposed. By comparison, a commonly used and commercially available lipid reagent for the delivery of siRNA (Oligofectamine) generated just 43% positive cells under the same conditions. The strong cellular fluorescence measured for the CDP/FL-siRNA sample was confirmed by confocal microscopic analysis.\n\nThese results indicate there is substantial uptake of CDP/siRNA polyplexes by cultured HeLa cells, strengthening the hypothesis that achieving down-regulation of a target gene in these cells is a possibility.\n\nWhile CDP/siRNA polyplexes are taken up to a great extent by cultured cells (see Section 3.4.3), polyplexes that are administered in vivo will encounter additional barriers to targeted gene down-regulation. The first of these obstacles encountered after injection will be the nuclease-rich environment of the blood. It has been shown by several researchers that, under \"normal\" delivery conditions (i.e., low-pressure injections) unmodified siRNA duplexes will not be efficiently endocytosed by cells and therefore will not achieve desired gene down-regulation in vivo [16][17][18] . This is due to the rapid degradation of the siRNA duplexes by nuclease proteins within the blood. To avoid this degradation, researchers have employed numerous chemical modifications to the siRNA, most notably changing the interbase linkages from phosphodiesters to phosphorothioates [19][20] . We expect that siRNA within our polyplexes may be protected from nuclease degradation, thereby eliminating the need to use more costly, chemically-modified duplexes.\n\nIn order to examine what protection, if any, CDP affords siRNA within polyplexes, siRNA alone and within CDP/siRNA polyplexes were exposed to active mouse serum and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Figure 3.9). Figure 3.9. CDP protects siRNA duplexes from serum nuclease degradation. CDP/siRNA polyplexes were exposed to active mouse serum at 37 o C for 4 h prior to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Uncomplexed siRNA, either in water (no serum; lane 1) or with only a momentary exposure to serum (lane 2) are included as negative controls for degradation. Heparan sulfate, which displaces CDP/siRNA polyplexes 21 , was added immediately prior to gel loading in lane 5. After a 4 h exposure to active mouse serum, siRNA that is displaced from CDP/siRNA polyplexes appears to be intact.\n\nWhen incubated in water (no serum) prior to gel electrophoresis, the siRNA gives a strong, single band (see lane 1). Addition of mouse serum immediately prior to gel loading (a \"t=0 exposure; see lane 2) has no significant effect on the siRNA migration or intensity, suggesting that more time is needed to induce degradation. A 4 h exposure to serum, however, leads to complete degradation of uncomplexed siRNA (see lane 3). When CDP/siRNA polyplexes are subjected to the same conditions and then directly electrophoresed, all of the siRNA remains CDP-bound within the well of the gel (see lane 4). This observation is expected based on previous gel retardation analysis (see Fig. 3.4) for the 3 +/-charge ratio employed here. When heparan sulfate is added to serum-treated polyplexes to displace the siRNA from CDP, the single siRNA band returns. This suggests that siRNA duplexes within CDP/siRNA polyplexes are protected from nuclease degradation when exposed to active mouse serum.\n\nThe results shown previously in this chapter demonstrate that CDP can condense siRNA duplexes into polyplexes that are suitable for cellular uptake and protect the siRNA from degradation. It is clear that complete condensation of siRNA can be achieved for all positive charge ratios (greater than 1/1 +/-; see Figure 3.4). But it is unclear from a simple gel retardation study whether all of the \"excess\" CDP participates in siRNA binding or if some of it remains uncomplexed, as \"bystander\" CDP molecules. To investigate this unbound polymer, an assay was developed to quantify the amount of uncomplexed CDP within unPEGylated polyplex formulations. rapidly aggregate when exposed to salt. Solutions of aggregated polyplexes are then centrifuged at high speed to pellet aggregates, leaving any unbound components within supernatants. Indeed, UV/Vis spectrophotometric analysis has confirmed the absence of nucleic acid within these supernatants (data not shown), suggesting that all polyplexes are within aggregates that have been pelleted by centrifugation. Unbound CDP in supernatants is then quantified by end-group analysis 21 and subtracted from the total amount of CDP within the formulation (bound plus unbound) to calculate the amount of CDP within the (aggregated) polyplexes-this amount of bound CDP is used to calculate an \"effective polyplex charge ratio\" (EPCR) that is reflective of the actual composition of the polyplexes within a given formulation. CDP/pDNA and CDP/siRNA polyplexes were formulated at a variety of overall charge ratios (from 2 to 30 +/-). PBS was added to induce polyplex aggregation, and aggregated polyplexes were pelleted by centrifugation. The amount of unbound CDP in the resulting supernatants was quantified by TNBS assay and subtracted from the total amount of CDP within the formulation to determine the amount of bound CDP within polyplexes; this amount of bound CDP was used to calculate the \"effective polyplex charge ratio\" (EPCR) on the polyplexes. All data points fall along the y = 1 line, corresponding to an EPCR of about 1/1 (+/-).\n\nFor all of the charge ratios examined, the amount of unbound CDP recovered in the supernatants scaled with the total amount of CDP within the formulation. As a consequence, the amount of bound CDP across these formulations was about the same; this amount corresponded to an effective charge ratio on the polyplex of about 1/1 +/-. From these observations, it appears that the amount of CDP within polyplexes is just enough to provide an equivalent amount of positive charges to balance the negative charges contributed by the phosphodiester backbones of the nucleic acids. Further, it can be concluded that any differences seen in formulations at high charge ratios (such as toxicity CD ITC run. (b) Fitted n values (moles AD bound per mole β-CD). (c) Fitted ∆H values (-1 * (calories per mol AD injected)). Stoichiometry results suggest that the majority of β-CD moieties within bound CDP molecules are unoccupied by AD-PEG. The increased binding energy on polyplexes suggests additional cooperative interactions among AD-PEG molecules on the polyplex surface.\n\nITC analysis of AD-PEG/β-CD interactions generated an equilibrium stoichiometry of n = 0.991, in excellent agreement with the expected value of 1 (AD and β-CD are known to exhibit 1:1 mol:mol binding 12 ). The observed binding constant, K = 3.75 x 10 4 M -1 (data not shown), is in excellent agreement with literature values for AD/β-CD inclusion complexes 12 . When AD-PEG was added to a solution of CDP (containing the same concentration of β-CD moieties), the observed stoichiometry dropped to n = 0.55. This result suggests that, for a pre-PEGylated formulation prepared with equimolar AD-PEG and CDP (with respect to AD and b-CD moieties), just over half of the β-CD cavities are occupied. CDP/pDNA polyplexes at a 30/1 (+/-) charge ratio give a stoichiometry almost identical to that of free CDP (n = 0.57). Given the previous finding that the effective polyplex charge ratio is 1/1 (+/-), one would expect 29/30 (96.7%) of CDP molecules within a 30/1 (+/-) formulation to be unbound, and, therefore, the ITC results to be almost identical to those of CDP alone. As the polyplex charge ratio is reduced from 30/1 (+/-) to 3/1 (+/-), the fraction of unbound CDP molecules drops, and the stoichiometry determined by ITC decreases from n = 0.57 to n = 0.17. This observation strongly suggests that, when AD-PEG is added to polyplexes after they have already been formed (\"post-PEGylated\"), the overwhelming majority (83%) of β-CD moieties remain unoccupied. The binding energy seen for polyplexes formed at 3/1 (+/-), -23 kcal/mol, is significantly higher than that seen for 30/1 (+/-) polyplexes or CDP alone (-6.9 kcal/mol and -6.7 kcal/mol, respectively). This result implies that there are cooperative interactions occurring between AD-PEG molecules on the polyplex surface, perhaps through formation of a PEG \"brush\" layer 22 .\n\nThese ITC results also imply that, due to the low occupancy of β-CD moieties within CDPcontaining polyplexes, adding an excess amount of AD-PEG (moles AD > moles β-CD) may confer additional stability. This was confirmed through a turbidity assay developed as an alternative method (to DLS) to assess polyplex aggregation. Polyplexes were pre-PEGylated or post-PEGylated with AD-PEG at either a 1:1 (AD:β-CD mol:mol, \"100%\") or 3:1 (\"300%\") ratio prior to incubation with PBS; aggregation (turbidity) was assessed by measurement of solution absorbance at 405 nm (Fig.\n\n3.12). 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 water unPEGylated post-PEGylated (100%) post-PEGylated (300%) pre-PEGylated (100%) pre-PEGylated (100%)\n\nFigure 3.12. Addition of \"excess\" AD-PEG leads to enhanced protection of CDP/pDNA polyplexes from salt-induced aggregation. Water and PEGylated or unPEGylated CDP/pDNA polyplexes were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37 o C followed by measurement of solution absorbance at 405 nm (A405). While equimolar addition of AD-PEG (\"100%\"), either before or after polyplex formation, sharply reduces the increase in A405 seen for unPEGylated polyplexes, addition of even more AD-PEG (\"300%\") completely abrogates any increase in A405 value.\n\nThe experimental results presented in this chapter suggest that the natures of CDPcontaining polyplexes made with either pDNA or siRNA are very similar. An equal mass of either nucleic acid appears to require the same amount of CDP for condensation, and the resulting polyplexes have similar sizes and exhibit the same concentration-dependence.\n\nModification of both types of polyplexes with AD-PEG reduces salt-induced aggregation and lowers surface charge (zeta potential).\n\nBecause the fundamental nature of pDNA and siRNA is much the same (linear arrangements of nucleotides connected by phosphodiester linkages), it is not surprising that polyplexes can be formed with either by addition of CDP under the same conditions.\n\nHowever, the difference in size between a single pDNA molecule (the plasmid here had\n\nA tremendous amount of research is being performed to better understand the mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells, making in vivo therapeutic applications of RNAi increasingly likely to emerge soon. However, systemic applications of virally delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes and related RNAi products are unlikely to be viable in the near future, due to host immune responses upon repeated delivery and ineffective tumor targeting. The systemic, non-viral delivery of RNAi molecules has been reported in mice and initially involved high-pressure, high-volume tail-vein injections of naked nucleic acids [1][2][3] ; this method is untenable and unacceptable in humans in routine clinical settings. Subsequently, naked siRNA [4][5][6] , lipid-formulated siRNA 7 , plasmids expressing short hairpin RNA [8][9] , and polycation-formulated siRNA [10][11][12] have been administered systemically in mice. Naked or formulated siRNAs have also been directly injected into xenograft tumors in mice [13][14][15][16] . Naked siRNAs require chemical stabilization for in vivo use 6,17 , have non-specific biodistributions that are the same as single-stranded antisense agents 18 , and require large and repeated dosages for efficacy 6 . Further, while synthetic siRNAs themselves have been shown to be non-immunogenic in mice 19 , some in vivo administrations of lipid formulations have been associated with immunogenicity [20][21][22] .\n\nThus the need for the development of a safe, effective non-viral delivery system for siRNA remains.\n\nThe synthesis and characterization of cyclodextrin-containing polycations that can bind and condense DNA into polymer-DNA complexes (\"polyplexes\") suitable for cellular uptake have been described [23][24] . These can be stabilized by incorporation of a neutral polymer (poly(ethylene glycol); PEG) tethered to a hydrophobic small molecule (adamantane; AD) siCON1: 5'-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU UUAUCGCUGAUUUGUGUAGUU-5'\n\n[The mutated nucleotides within siEFBP2mut are indicated in bold; the putative immunostimulatory motif within siCON1 is underlined.]\n\nHeLa and BHK cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 x antibioticantimycotic (penicillin, streptomycin, and amphoterecin B). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 50,000 cells per well 24 h prior to transfection. Polyplexes were prepared with pGL3CV alone or in combination with siGL3 or siEGFP at a charge ratio of 3/1 (+/-).\n\nLipoplexes were prepared with the same nucleic acid combinations using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all polyplex and lipoplex samples, each well received 1 µg pDNA and 100 nM of the indicated siRNA. Complexes were incubated with cells in serum-free medium (OptiMEM, Invitrogen) for 4 h, after which solutions were aspirated and replaced with complete growth medium. At a total of 48 h post-transfection, growth medium was aspirated and replaced with 100 µL 1 x Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Plates were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for ~1 h to allow complete cell lysis. The luminescence of cell lysates was then determined using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Pharmingen) and the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). One hundred microliters substrate solution was added to 10 µL cell lysate, and the resulting luminescent signal was integrated over 10 sec.\n\nTC71 cells (provided by Dr. Timothy Triche, Children's Hospital-Los Angeles) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (no antibiotics). They were plated in 6-well plates and grown until they reached 30% confluency. siRNA was complexed with Oligofectamine (OFA, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations or with CDP at a 3/1 (+/-) charge ratio. The resulting formulations were applied to each well in serum-free medium (OptiMEM) at a final siRNA concentration of 100 nM for 4 h. All transfected cells were harvested at 48 h, and EWS-Fli1 and β-actin protein levels were assessed by Western blot using primary monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of Fli1 ( BD Biosciences) and polyclonal antibodies against β-Actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology). TC71-LUC cells suspended in 0.2 mL RPMI 1640 (without FBS or antibiotics) through the tail vein using a 27-gauge needle. All experimental manipulations with the mice were performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.\n\nMice were imaged at indicated time points using an in vivo IVIS 100 bioluminescence/optical imaging system (Xenogen). D-luciferin (Xenogen) dissolved in 4.4 RESULTS\n\nAn initial investgation of the ability of CDP/siRNA polyplexes to down-regulate a target gene was performed in HeLa (human cervical carinoma) and BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, which have been previously shown to express genes delivered from CDP/pDNA polyplexes at high levels 23 . Polyplexes were prepared that contained both a plasmid encoding the gene for luciferase (pGL3CV) alone, or with either an siRNA duplex targeting that luciferase gene (siGL3) or an siRNA duplex targeting an irrelevant gene  Polyplexes containing a control siRNA sequence (siEGFP) show some, but non-zero, suppression of luciferase expression (42% and 35% reduction in HeLa and BHK cells, respectively, compared to CDP/pDNA only). This non-specific down-regulation seen with siEGFP may be a consequence of the relative high dose (100 nM) of siRNA used here and has been reported elsewhere under similar conditions [34][35] . By contrast, the amount of luciferase protein is reduced by 87% and 92% in HeLa and BHK cells, respectively, for siGL3-containing polyplexes. These results are indicative of strong, sequence-specific luciferase suppression.\n\nHeLa Cells (Lipoplexes) a 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06 Lipo/pGL3CV Lipo/(pGL3CV+siGL3) Lipo/(pGL3CV+siEGFP) RLU/(ug protein) HeLa Cells (Polyplexes) b 1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04 CDP/pGL3CV CDP/(pGL3CV+siGL3) CDP/(pGL3CV+siEGFP) RLU/(ug protein) BHK Cells (Polyplexes) c 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06 CDP/pGL3CV CDP/(pGL3CV+siGL3) CDP/(pGL3CV+siEGFP) (RLU/ug protein)\n\nHaving demonstrated sequence-specific down-regulation of a co-delivered exogenous gene by CDP/siRNA complexes in cultured cells, the ability of these polyplexes to reduce levels of an endogenous gene was examined in cultured Ewing's sarcoma (TC71) cells. siRNA duplexes were obtained that either target the junction of the EWS-Fli1 fusion gene (siEFBP2) or a mutated, non-functional variant (siEFBP2mut). Lipoplexes were made with Oligofectamine, a commercially available lipid reagent, as a positive control for down-regulation. EWS-Fli1 protein levels were measured in the lysates of cells 48 h after transfection by Western blotting (Fig. Using a previously reported siRNA sequence targeting the EWS-FLI1 breakpoint (siEFBP2) 29 , we observed comparable and significant (greater than 50%) reduction in EWS-FLI1 protein levels using both Oligofectamine and CDP. Delivery of a mutated siRNA sequence (siEFBP2mut) failed to elicit such down-regulation (data not shown for CDP), demonstrating the sequence-specific nature of the RNAi effect.\n\nAfter successful demonstration of down-regulation of both endogenous and exogenous targets in cultured cells, siRNA-containing polyplex formulations were then tested for their ability to achieve similar down-regulation in vivo. Transgenic C57BL/6 mice were created that constitutively express luciferase exclusively in hepatocytes within their livers.\n\nHepatocytes express high levels of the cell surface asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr), which is known to recognize galactose as a ligand [36][37] . External material that is galactosylated and sufficiently small (less than ~70 nm in diameter 38 ) may be endocytosed by hepatocytes. Thus, CDP/siRNA polyplexes were targeted to hepatocytes by galactosylation via incorporation with an AD-PEG-Lactose modifier (galactose is the terminal moiety of lactose, a disaccharide).\n\nLuciferase-expressing mice received three consecutive daily administrations of galactosylated CDP/siRNA polyplexes containing either siRNA targeting luciferase (siGL3) or a single injection of polyplexes containing non-targeting control sequence  luciferase expression was followed and quantified by whole-animal bioluminescent imaging. Integrated signal is presented as a percentage of the signal on Day -2 (for each mouse). Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean. (b) Images of one mouse from each group are shown from Days -2, 7, and 19 post-injection. Mice receiving the siGL3-containing formulation show significant luciferase down-regulation (up to >50%) that was maximal at Day 7.\n\nDown-regulation of luciferase was observed for mice receiving galactosylated siGL3containing formulations. Luciferase reduction was most significant between days 4 and 9 after the first injection, with a maximal reduction of 75% seen on day 7. Significant reduction was not seen for mice receiving the control injections at any timepoint examined.\n\nThese results indicate that CDP/siRNA polyplexes targeted with AD-PEG-Lac are suitable for uptake and down-regulation of a target gene in hepatocytes.\n\nIt was shown previously that CDP/siRNA polyplexes are capable of reducing levels of the EWS-Fli1 fusion oncogene in cultured Ewing's sarcoma cells (see Section 4.4.2). Given this result and the in vivo knockdown targeting polyplexes produced in transgenic mice expressing luciferase in hepatocytes (see Section 4.4.3), it was hypothesized that polyplexes targeted to Ewing's sarcoma cells could be employed to inhibit Ewing's sarcoma tumorigenesis in mice.\n\nIn order to examine this possibility, a target on the cell surface of Ewing's sarcoma cells needed to be identified. Since the membrane-bound transferrin receptor (TfR) has been shown to be up-regulated in a wide variety of cancers 39   Because the fluorescence of TC71 cells exposed to all three concentrations of Tf-FITC was very high (>80% compared to untreated control cells), we conclude that TfR levels on TC71 cells are high enough to consider targeting polyplexes to TfR to direct uptake by TC71 cells in vivo. Further, analogous to the targeting of ASGPr on hepatocytes with an adamantane-poly(ethylene glycol)-lactose (AD-PEG-Lac) conjugate discussed above (see Section 4.3.3), the synthesis and characterization of an AD-PEG-Tf conjugate, and its use to target TfR-expressing cells, have previously been described 26 . TC71 cells were made to constitutively express luciferase (TC71-LUC cells) via lentiviral infection such that tumor formation could be followed by whole-animal bioluminescence imaging. In order to determine our ability to follow these cells by imaging and the extent of tumorigenesis, NOD/scid mice were injected with TC71-LUC cells by tail vein  After initially residing in the lung capillary beds, injected TC71-LUC cells disseminated, and tumors were visualized in a variety of locations a couple of weeks after injection.\n\nOverall, the tumor engraftment sites observed (lung, vertebral column, pelvis, femur, and soft tissue) were comparable to the most common locations of metastases in EFT patients.\n\nThe ability of targeted, siRNA-containing polyplexes to down-regulate EWS-Fli1 in these TC71-LUC-derived tumors was then tested, both indirectly by bioluminescence imaging and directly by qRT-PCR analysis of harvested tumors. Mice that had formed tumors after injection with TC71-LUC cells were treated with two consecutive daily injections of polyplexes that were targeted with AD-PEG-Lac and contained siRNA targeting the EWS/Fli1 fusion gene (siEFBP2). A summary plot of the imaging results is shown in  We hypothesized that targeted siEFBP2-containing polyplexes would reduce the rate of tumor growth in mice receiving them, leading to a transient reduction in the rate of increase, or even a decrease, of tumor bioluminescence. Indeed, a transient reduction in bioluminescence was seen on days 1 and 2 after the first of consecutive daily injections of these formulations. While indirect, this result suggested that the expected knockdown of the EWS/Fli1 gene in TC71-LUC cells in vivo was occurring.\n\nTo probe this down-regulation more directly, similar (two consecutive daily) injections were made in tumor-bearing mice of targeted polyplexes containing either siEFBP2 or a non-targeting control sequence (siCON1). This time, instead of simply following the bioluminescence, mice were sacrificed the day after the second injection, tumors were harvested, and the levels of EWS/Fli-1 mRNA transcripts were measured by quantitative,  Two consecutive daily injections of Tf-targeted, siEFBP2-containing formulations reduced EWS-Fli1 transcript levels by greater than 50% compared to formulations made with a control siRNA sequence (siCON1). Taken together with the results of Figure 4.6, this provides both indirect and direct evidence that formulated siRNA can achieve the desired gene knockdown in vivo.\n\nThe final hypothesis that was examined regarding these formulations was whether or not this target gene knockdown in vivo would have a corresponding therapeutic effect, e.g., reduced tumor growth. In order to answer this, a long-term treatment schedule was adopted in which TC71-LUC-treated mice received twice weekly injections of formulations for four weeks, starting immediately after injection of TC71-LUC cells (see Table 4.1. Treatment groups for long-term tumor inhibition study.\n\nTumor growth was monitored and quantified by whole-animal bioluminescence imaging; a summary plot of the results is shown in  These long-term (four weeks) injections of siRNA-containing formulations in tumorbearing NOD/scid mice reveal that only the targeted, formulated siEFBP2 achieves longterm tumor growth inhibition. Neither naked siEFBP2 nor a formulated control siRNA sequence shows any effect on tumor signal compared to the control group receiving only the carrier fluid. These results demonstrate the sequence-specificity of the observed inhibition, the necessity of the targeting agent (AD-PEG-Tf), and the therapeutic potential of this delivery system. no toxicity or immune response. Female C57BL/6 mice received a single administration of formulated siRNA. At 2 h or 24 h post-treatment, blood was drawn by cardiac puncture and plasma was isolated. (a,b) Whole blood was used for determination of platelet (PLT) and white blood cell (WBC) counts. Plasma was used for measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), creatinine (CRE), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The averages of triplicate mice for each time point are plotted; error bars represent standard deviations. (c,d) Cytokine ELISA results for C57BL/6 mice receiving formulations showed no upregulation of IL-12 or IFN-α. The plasma levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12 (p40)) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in mice described above were measured by ELISA. [Treatment groups: A, 5% (w/v) glucose only (D5W); B, naked siEFBP2; C, targeted, formulated siCON1; D, targeted, formulated siEFBP2; E, non-targeted, formulated siEFBP2; Wildtype, uninjected; 2, blood drawn 2 h after injection; 24, blood drawn 24 h after injection.] (e) H&E staining of major organs of the NOD/scid mice after long-term treatment. Major organs were collected, formalin-fixed, and processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining using standard methods. Images were collected using a Nikon epifluorescent microscope with a DP11 digital camera.\n\nCollectively, none of the formulations show any significant effects on the levels of IL-12, IFN-α, white blood cells, platelets, secreted liver enzymes (ALT and AST), BUN, or CRE in immunocompetent (C57BL/6), and histology of the major organs of mice receiving long-term treatment (twice-weekly injections for four weeks) showed no apparent damage. These results show the safety and low immunogenicity of CDP-containing formulations and demonstrate the attractiveness of this methodology for systemic, targeted delivery of nucleic acids. Indeed, MALLS has been employed previously with CDP/pDNA polyplexes in order to determine molar mass and polyplex stoichiometry 2 . The average polyplex molar mass was determined to be ~1 x 10 7 Da, from which the average number of polymer and pDNA molecules per polyplex were calculated to be 1200 and 1.7, respectively. This was an important finding because it indicated that the number of plasmids, and therefore the number of genes, in an individual complex is very small (1 or 2). It also sheds light on the range of target ligand densities that are possible, as will be discussed in further detail below. adamantane-poly(ethylene glycol) (AD-PEG) conjugates), the size and nature of these ligands are very different (lactose is a relatively small disaccharide, while transferrin is a comparatively large protein).\n\nBased on some preliminary in vitro work and successful results published elsewhere [3][4][5] , we employed 0.1% (1:1000 w:w) AD-PEG-Tf/AD-PEG and 20% (1:5 w:w) AD-PEG-Lac:AD-PEG loadings, respectively. While these are the total amounts added to the formulation, this is certainly not reflective of the exact amount of these AD-PEG-ligand species within the polyplexes themselves. For example, at 3/1 (+/-) formulation conditions, two-thirds of all CDP molecules remain unbound, and thus AD-PEG-ligand molecules that have formed inclusion complexes with these unbound CDPs will not contribute to polyplex target. If anything, they have the potential to reduce polyplex targeting by competing with ligands on the polyplexes for cell surface receptors.\n\nThe recommendation here is that the incorporation of these ligands within polyplexes be further quantified. Essential to such quantification is the ability to separate unbound material from polyplexes, a method for which I have developed using a centrifugal filtration unit (illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.2). Preliminary work with this separation strategy using CDP/pDNA polyplexes has demonstrated that (1) polyplexes must be PEGylated in order to avoid sticking to the membrane, (2) all polyplexes are retained in the sample reservoir upon centrifugation, and\n\n(3) the effective diameter and count rate of polyplexes are unchanged after centrifugal filtration (data not shown).\n\nCentrifugal filtration to remove unbound materials within formulations could be used to quantify polyplex ligand density in multiple ways. For AD-PEG-Lac-containing formulations, separation of free material using a MWCO = 50,000 Da could be followed by direct quantification of galactose using a standard, commercially-available galactose into the AD-PEG-conjugate 8 . However, there is abundant literature suggesting that multiantennary presentation of galactose, as well as different galactose derivatives (e.g., Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)) having significantly enhanced binding affinity for ASGPr, could lead to improved specificity of targeted polyplexes [9][10][11] . This issue of binding affinity is particularly important given the relatively few ligand incorporation sites (β-CD moieties within bound CDP molecules) within our polyplexes. The use of stronger binding galactose derivatives should be considered to confer enhanced polyplex targeting to hepatocytes.\n\nBecause the transferrin receptor (TfR) has been shown to be up-regulated in actively dividing cells 12 , including cancer cells 13 such as Ewing's sarcoma 14 , we employed conjugates of AD-PEG containing iron-loaded transferrin (AD-PEG-Tf) to target Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells. Because all non-cancerous cells have non-zero levels of TfR on their surfaces, however, the possibility of receptor-mediated endocytosis of targeted polyplexes by undesired cell types remains. A ligand/receptor combination that would be more specific to ES cells, if it exists, would be likely to confer even better targeting of formulations to these cells. Literature results indicate that the cell surface molecule CD99, which is over-expressed on Ewing's family of tumors only, may be one such target 15 . In addition to enhanced specificity, engagement of CD99 has been shown to have a functional role in inducing apoptosis 16 . Anti-CD99 antibodies (or antibody fragments) should be considered for incorporation within AD-PEG-conjugates to generate formulations of which an even higher fraction of the administered dose reaches these target ES tumor cells.\n\nA final point to consider in order to improve potency of these formulations is the nature of the therapeutic agent (siRNA duplex) itself. Very recently, it has been reported that synthetic dsRNA molecules that are somewhat longer than siRNA duplexes (~25-30 nt in length) can be up to two orders of magnitude more potent than corresponding siRNAs 17 . In the discussion of the mechanism of RNAi in Chapter 1, it was mentioned that siRNA duplexes bypass the initial Dicer-mediated cleavage event normally performed on longer dsRNAs to generate the siRNA effector duplexes that are recruited to RISC. These new results support a new hypothesis that these longer dsRNAs, which are Dicer substrates, are more potent because of the coupled nature of the production of siRNA and its incorporation within RISC. Indeed, a separate report indicates that synthetic, 29-bp small hairpins RNAs (shRNAs) are also more potent than corresponding siRNAs and describes the precise nature of Dicer shRNA cleavage products 18 . Both of these studies demonstrate that, if properly designed, longer dsRNAs can be much stronger down-regulators of a given target gene. I recommend that such dsRNAs be explored for subsequent applications of these targeted non-viral formulations."
