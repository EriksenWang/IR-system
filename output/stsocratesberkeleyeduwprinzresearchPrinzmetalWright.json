    "full_text": "Five experiments investigated the influence of cognitive and linguistic factors on the integration of color and letter-shape information.\n\nSubjects were briefly presented strings of colored letters that varied in pronounceability and familiarity. Detection and search tasks required subjects to identify the color of predesignated target letters. It was proposed that errors in integrating color and shape would be less likely with items from different perceptual units than from items within the same perceptual unit. If words, at some level of perceptual analysis, are processed as units whereas nonwords are processed by individual letters, then there should be more letter-shape and color feature integration errors with words than with nonwords. The first two experiments tested this prediction by comparing feature integration errors with words and nonwords. The remaining experiments manipulated letter-string pronounceability, familiarity, and the presence of vowels to isolate the factors that may influence feature integration. The results demonstrate that cognitive and linguistic factors, such as familiarity and pronounceability, can influence the combination of colors and shapes in perception.\n\nWhile looking at a garden, one may notice red roses, yellow marigolds, blue daffodils, a green lawn, and the cinnamon-brown of a tree trunk. How do we know that it is the roses that are red, or that the green belongs to the lawn? Clearly we are not conscious of the process of combining information about object shapes and their colors. There is experimental evidence, however, that at some level(s) of perceptual analysis, color and shape information are separate. For example, Nissen (1979) found with a partial report task that when the location of a colored target item was cued, judgments about the target's color and its shape were independent. The subjects were no more likely to respond with the correct color when their response on the shape judgment was correct than when their response on the shape was incorrect, and vice versa. Color and shape also satisfy several of Garner's criteria for separable or analyzable dimensions (Garner, 1970). For example, similarity ratings of stimuli that vary in color and shape are best represented by a city block metric rather than Euclidean metric (Handel & Imai, 1972). In speeded classification tasks, color and shape can be attended to separately with no interference from the irrelevant attribute (Gottwald & Garner, 1972). Finally, Treisman and Schmidt (1982) have demonstrated that under some circumstances subjects incorrectly combine shape and color information. Treisman and Schmidt briefly presented stimulus arrays consisting of letters drawn in different colors. In whole-report, detection, and same-different tasks, subjects reported the correct colors and letters in the incorrect combinations more often than would be expected by chance. If colors and shapes are analyzed separately at some stage of processing, as suggested by this research, then it becomes important to discover how the visual system integrates this information. Why do we not see the roses as cinnamon-brown? Prinzmetal(l981) has suggested that the visual system uses information about perceptual organization or stimulus structure to combine correctly stimulus attributes. The assumption is that at an early stage of processing, visual input is parsed into perceptual units or objects (e.g., Kahneman, 1973;Neisser, 1967). Stimulus attributes from different perceptual units are constrained from combining in perception. However, stimulus attributes from the same perceptual unit are not constrained in this way (see Fox, 1979, for a similar proposal). Prinzmetal (1981) found evidence for this proposition in an experiment where the critical features were vertical and horizontal lines that were embedded in circles. Perceptual organization was manipulated by using the Gestalt principle of good continuation or of similarity. With brief exposure durations, features (vertical and horizontal lines) were less likely to combine forming the illusion of a plus when the features were in different perceptual units than when they were in the same perceptual unit. In other words, perceptual organization prevented the illusory conjunction of features.\n\nIn the present study we were interested in whether multiletter units in word-like letter strings would affect feature integration. In these experiments, subjects were asked to identify a colored target letter in a string of letters that varied in orthographic regularity and familiarity. We hypothesized that it would be more difficult to correctly integrate color and letter-shape information in word-like letter strings than in nonwords. This prediction was based on the heuristic, discussed above, that features in different perceptual units are less likely to combine than features within the same unit. If words are processed by units larger than individual letters (consonant clusters, morphemes, whole words, etc.), but nonwords are processed by units no larger than individual letters, then there may be more errors in integrating color and letter-shape in words than in nonwords. Hence, we were interested in whether the heuristic suggested by Prinzmetal would apply with the features of color and letter-shape and when the unitization of the stimulus is influenced by cognitive and linguistic factors such as familiarity and pronounceability.\n\nTwo general interests motivate this research. First, we wanted to determine whether higher-order factors would have any influence on the integration of color and shape. On the one hand there is a class of theory for which feature integration is strictly a \"bottom-up\" process and should not be intluenced by variables such as pronounceability and familiarity. For example, according to Wolford's feature perturbation theory only retinal eccentricity, array position, and the distance between stimulus items should affect feature integration (Wolford, 1975). On the other hand, another class of theory predicts that higher-order factors would affect the integration of letter-shape and color. For example, Treisman's attentional theory might predict an effect of cognitive or linguistic factors (Treisman & Gelade, 1980;Treisman & Schmidt, 1982). According to Treisman, focal attention is the glue that combines features. Features from stimulus items within focal attention may be combined as may features from items outside of focal attention. However, features within focal attention will not combine with features from outside of focal attention. Laberge (1983) has demonstrated with probe reaction time that subjects spread their attention over several letters when the task requires the processing of words, but that they focus their attention to a single letter position when the task requires processing of letters. This suggests that under some circumstances words can be attended to as wholes. If words in the present experiments are \"attended to\" as wholes, or in units larger than individual letters, but nonwords are attended to letter by letter, then subjects should make more errors in combining color and letter information in words than in nonwords. Two points should be made clear. First, Treisman's account is used here as an example of a theory that may predict an effect of cognitive and/or linguistic factors on feature integration, but other approaches are possible. Second, even if factors such as the pronounceability or familiarity of a letter string influence feature integration, it does not preclude the possibility that sensory factors like retinal eccentricity and the interletter distance also influence feature integration. Complete theories of the integration of information by the visual system would have to account for both kinds of factors.\n\nOur second broad area of interest is the possibility that errors in integrating color and shape in letter strings might provide new insights and methods for the study of word perception. The prediction that subjects would make more errors in words than in nonwords is based on the hypothesis that words are processed by multiletter units. There are several sources of evidence for this proposal. For example, the finding that letters in words are recognized with greater accuracy than letters in nonwords (i.e., the word superiority effect) has been used as evidence that words are processed by units larger than individual letters and hence there are fewer units in words than in nonwords (Smith & Haviland, 1972;Wheeler, 1970). However, there are other explanations of the word superiority effect that do not postulate analysis of perceptual units larger than individual letters. Subjects may use their knowledge of redundancies in English spelling to narrow the candidate letters they must consider (Bjork & Estes, 1973;Thompson & Massaro, 1973; but also see Johnston, 1978). In the experiments reported here, evidence for unitization in word perception would involve poorer performance with words than with nonwords in correctly integrating letter-shape with an attribute that is irrelevant to the word's identity-the color of the letters. Hence, our results could complement one interpretation of the word superiority effect. Evidence also has been adduced for specific multiletter units in word perception such as consonant clusters or syllables (e.g., Pring, 1981;Santa, Santa, & Smith, 1977;Spoehr & Smith, 1973). Although the present study was not designed to test between specific multiletter units of analysis, colors may be more likely to be incorrectly combined with letters within intraword units, such as syllables, than between units. This possibility is discussed in the General Discussion. Before investigating specific units within words with errors of feature integration, we felt that a necessary first step was to show that linguistic and/or cognitive variables had some effect on the integration of color and letter-shape.\n\nIn this paper we have adopted the following terminology from Treisman and Schmidt (1982). Errors that result from incorrectly perceiving a lettershape, or errors that result from incorrectly perceiving a color are called feature errors. Errors that result from incorrectly combining correctly perceived colors and letters are called conjunction err0r.s or illusory conjunctions. Treisman and Schmidt entertained the possibility that conjunction errors could consist of either features switching in an integral way or of a feature duplicating itself. Although Treisman and Schmidt only found evidence of the former type of errors, in the present studies we have no experimental way of separating these two types of conjunction errors.' We adopt the term conjunction error without assuming Treisi lfeisman and Schmidt used a whole-report task to investigate whether colors and shapes simply switch or whether a feature may duplicate itself leaving a \"ghost\" behind. Since our prime interest was to compare performance on word-like letters strings with nonwords, a whole-report task would not have been appropriate in the present studies. Hence, we do man's model of how feature integration occurs and without assuming that feature integration is not constrained (cf. Mozer, 1983). In designing these studies, we used four criteria. First, we wanted to use accuracy as our dependent variable rather than reaction time, because predictions in terms of accuracy follow more directly from our hypothesis about feature integration. Although reaction time has been used to study feature integration (e.g., Duncan, 1979;Treisman, 1977Treisman, , 1982;;Treisman & Gelade, 1980), additional assumptions must be made. One must assume, for instance, that to avoid making conjunction errors, subjects search more slowly. In addition, in order to use reaction time to investigate feature integration it has sometimes, been necessary to assume additive factors logic (Treisman, 1982;Treisman & Gelade, 1980). By using accuracy as the dependent variable, these assumptions can be avoided. Our second criteria was that we wanted differences in conjunction errors to represent perceptual rather than memory limitations. Therefore, in each of these studies we used detection or search paradigms that had minimum memory requirements. Although a whole-report task may have provided more information on each trial, we wanted any differences between words and other types of letter strings to be the result of conjunction errors in perception and not in memory (cf. Treisman, 1977). Third, we had to be able to equate the relative frequency of both letter identification and color identification feature errors across letter-string types. The probability of feature errors must be equated across the different types of letter strings because we do not know the relation between feature and conjunction errors. It might be that the more feature errors subjects make the less the probability of conjunction errors, because features must be correctly registered before they can be incorrectly combined. Alternatively, it could be the case that feature and conjunction errors covary. In order to draw meaningful conclusions about feature integration in various types of letter not have experimental evidence on this issue. However, both of us served as subjects in a pilot experiment that was identical to Experiment 1, and we can anecdotally report that in the present studies, consistent with Treisman and Schmidt, colors did not seem to duplicate. In these experiments the stimuli consisted of strings of three colored letters and on some of the trials two of the letters were the same color. If colors duplicated themselves, then on some occasions all of the letters would appear to be drawn in the same color and this did not happen. However, recently we have replicated Experiment 2 using an Apple computer and color monitor instead of the tachistoscope used in these studies. With the color monitor, the colors seemed to duplicate themselves quite often, giving the phenomenal appearance that all of the letters were the same color. This happened even with the knowledge that the stimuli never had three letters drawn in the same color. Despite the very different phenomenal appearance of the stimuli, the experiment using a color monitor replicated the findings reported here.\n\nstrings, therefore, it was necessary to equate the letter strings in terms of feature extraction. Since there is abundant evidence that letter recognition is better in words and pronounceable pseudowords than in nonwords (Baron & Thurston, 1973;Reicher, 1969;Wheeler, 1970), we did not want differences in conjunction errors to merely reflect the differences in letter recognition (letter feature errors) that we know exist. Therefore, we designed our stimuli so that subjects were nearly perfect at discriminating letters, and the errors that subjects committed could be attributed to either color feature errors or conjunction errors. The final criterion, which follows from the necessity of equating feature errors, is that our paradigm allow us to estimate separately the relative frequency of color and letter identification feature errors and conjunction errors. We used several different tasks that fulfilled these goals.\n\nThe sequence of studies in this report mirror the strategy that has been used in studying the word superiority effect. In Experiments 1 and 2 we compared performance with words and with unfamiliar, unpronounceable nonwords. In the remaining studies we tried to determine the properties of words that affected feature integration such as pronounceability, familiarity, and the presence or absence of vowels.\n\nEXPERIMENT 1 In the first experiment, we compared words and nonwords in a forcedchoice task that allowed us to estimate separately letter feature errors, color feature errors, and conjunction errors. We predicted more conjunction errors in words than in nonwords while using stimulus parameters that would keep the number of feature errors constant. On each trial, the subjects were briefly presented a string of three colored letters that formed either a word or a nonword. Each string contained either the target letter R or the target letter G, and there were four possible colors. The subject's task was to identify the target (R or G) and to name its color. In this experiment letter feature errors can be assessed with performance on the two-alternative, forced-choice letter identification task. Color feature errors and conjunction errors can be assessed by examining two types of color errors. First, subjects may respond with a color that was not part of the stimulus array (off error), and second, subjects may respond with a color that was present in the display, but not the color of the target (on error). If target color information were not available, and the subjects are forced to guess, they will sometimes commit an 011 error, sometimes an off error. In contrast, if color information were available, but subjects incorrectly combined the target with another item's color (i.e., conjunction error), they can only commit an OIZ error. Hence, off errors can only represent color feature errors. On errors represent an mixture of color feature errors and illusory conjunctions. If we find no difference in off errors between words and nonwords then we can conclude that feature errors do not differ with stimulus type. If we find more OIZ errors with words than with nonwords, then we can infer that the additional 012 errors with words are the result of illusory conjunctions. Conjunction errors in words and nonwords also can be compared without assuming equivalence of off errors by examining the proportion of on errors in excess of what is expected by chance.\n\nProcedure. The stimulus set consisted of six words (GOT, ROT, AGE, ARE, TAG, and TAR) and six nonwords (GDF, RDF, VGH, VRH, FVG, and FVR) that contained either the letter R or G. Each nonword was created by replacing nontarget letters in a corresponding word with visually similar letters. The colors of the letters were selected from the set red, green, brown, and purple as described below. The stimuli were briefly presented either above or below a fixation point. The subject's task was to report the color of the target letter and whether the target was an R or G. For example, a response might be \"red G.\" The subjects were required to guess when they were not sure.\n\nThe subjects were initially given several practice trials with single-colored target letters. These trials were then followed by approximately 180 practice trials using both words and nonword stimuli in order to allow the subject to become familiar with the experimental task. The practice trials were also used to determine the exposure duration at which a color or letter not represented in the stimulus would be incorrectly reported 5% of the time. Feedback was given only during the practice session.\n\nData were collected over 432 trials in two l-h sessions. Words and their corresponding nonwords were presented in 12 blocks of 36 trials each. For half the subjects, the first 18 trials in each block consisted of only words and the second 18 trials only nonwords. The remaining subjects began each block with 18 nonword trials, followed by 18 word trials. Within each block, two thirds of the stimuli had three different colors, and one third had two different colors. Within this constraint, the order of presentation was random. The exposure duration was adjusted between blocks as follows. If the subject incorrectly reported that the target was a color or a letter not presented in the stimulus more than 5% of the time in a block of trials, the exposure duration was increased by 10 ms for the next block, If these errors occurred less than 5% of the time, the exposure duration was reduced by 10 ms. Otherwise, the exposure duration setting was not changed between blocks. The exposure durations used in the experimental trials ranged from 160 to 300 ms, with a mean exposure duration of 240 ms.\n\nSt&r.&. There were 108 word stimuli and 108 nonword stimuli. Each stimulus was used twice in the experiment. The target letters R and G appeared equally often in each letter position. The sequence of colors for each word stimulus exactly matched the sequence of colors in the corresponding nonword stimulus. Hence there were 108 unique sequences. In 72 of these sequences, each of the letters was drawn in a different color (three-color stimuli), and with these stimuli each color and each target letter was used equally often in each position. In the remaining 36 stimuli, two letters were drawn in the same color (twocolor stimuli). In these stimuli, each position and each color was used equally often for the nonrepeated color. As in the three-color stimuli, each color and each target letter was used equally often in each letter position. In 12 of the color sequences that had a repeated color, the target was the odd color. Within these considerable constraints, the colors were assigned randomly. Half of the three-colored stimuli and half the two-colored stimuli were drawn above the fixation point, and the remaining stimuli were drawn below the fixation point.\n\nThe stimuli were drawn on 5 x 8-in index cards using a No. 978 Staedtler-Mars stencil and colored felt-tipped pens. The four colors that we referred to as red, brown, green, and purple most closely matched Munsell colors with designations 2.5R 6/10, 2.5YR 6/6, 2.5G 7/6, and 1OPB 7/6 with the tachistoscope's illumination. The colors are best described as pastel, similar in brightness and saturation, and differing mostly in hue. Half of the stimuli were drawn so that the nearest edge of the letters was 2.7 cm above the center of the cards while the remaining stimuli were located the same distance below the center. The stimuli were presented with a Scientific Prototype model GB tachistoscope at a viewing distance of 118 cm. Each of the stimulus strings subtended a visual angle of 0.39\" vertically and 0.97\" horizontally. The width of individual letters varied, but on average they subtended a visual angle of approximately 0.25\" with an interletter space of approximately 0.1\". Stimulus presentations were preceded and followed by a fixation field and the illuminance of both fixation field and stimulus field was set at about 7.5 foot-candles.\n\nSubjects. Twelve Princeton University students, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no known deficiencies in color vision, were paid to participate in this and in each of the following experiments. Twelve different subjects participated in each experiment.\n\nIn this experiment subjects could incorrectly identify the target's shape or they could incorrectly identify its color. Subjects discriminated target shapes (G vs R) nearly perfectly, Out of a total of 5184 experimental trials there were only 15 letter discrimination errors (0.3%)-6 for words and 9 for nonwords. Letter discrimination errors could have constituted a source of feature errors, but they were so rare in this experiment that they did not affect the analysis presented below. In all the experiments reported here, trials on which subjects made an error in identifying the target letter are excluded from the analysis of color identification errors.\n\nThe limit on performance was in identifying the target colors. Subjects incorrectly identified the target color on 12% of the trials. Color identification errors were classified into on-the-stimulus errors and off-thestimulus errors. (Recall that an off error is a response with a color not present in the stimulus; an on error is a response with a color that was present in the stimulus.) The percentages of on and off errors are presented in Table 1. These percentages were used to compare words and nonwords with respect to perceiving the colors (feature errors) and correctly integrating color and letter-shape information (conjunction errors).\n\nColor feature errors presumably arise when not enough color information is available. A certain proportion of these trials will result in on errors and a certain proportion will result in off errors. Since off errors can only represent feature errors, offerrors were used as a direct measure of feature errors. The assumption in this analysis is that oflerrors represent the same proportion of the total number of feature errors for both words and nonwords.\n\nTABLE 1 Color Identification Errors: Experiment 1 Words Nonwords Target position 1 2 3 Mean 1 2 3 Mean On errorsa 8.68 13.66 5.67 9.34 5.32 6.83 3.47 5.21 Off errorsb 4.75 4.05 4.51 4.44 4.51 4.51 5.09 4.70 pconjc 8.06 18.84 -2.67 8.08 -2.38 -2.92 -14.94 -6.75\n\n' The percentage of trials on which subjects incorrectly responded with a nontarget color that was included in the stimulus display.\n\nb The percentage of trials on which subjects incorrectly responded with a color not included in the stimulus display.\n\n' The percentage of on errors in excess of what is expected by chance.\n\nThe percentage of off errors did not differ significantly for words and nonwords, 4.44 vs 4.70%, (F(1 ,ll) = 1.22, MS, = 1.0790).2 This indicates that the probability of a color feature error is the same in words as in nonwords. The percentage of off errors also did not differ as a function of target position (F(2,22) = 0.38, MS, = 4.4060), nor was the target position x stimulus-type (word vs nonword) interaction significant (F(2,22) = 0.20, MS, = 5.7408). As with the analysis of words and nonwords, this suggests that color feature errors did not vary with target position.\n\nConjunction errors were analyzed in two ways. First, if on errors represent both feature errors and conjunction errors, and if the proportion of feature errors does not vary as a function of the type of stimulus, then differences in OIZ errors could only reflect differences in conjunction errors. Subjects made a significantly greater percentage of 012 errors with words than with nonwords, 9.34 vs 5.21% (F(l,ll) = 43.93, p < .Ol). The percentage of on errors also significantly varied as a function of target position (F(2,22) = 8.87, p < .Ol). Finally, the target position x stimulus-type interaction was significant (F(2,22) = 4.29, p < .05). As shown in Table 1, subjects made more on errors when the target was in the center position than when the target was in one of the end positions. This po-sition effect was greater for words than for nonwords. A target in the center position is adjacent to two nontarget letters, whereas a target in the end position is adjacent to only one nontarget letter. This pattern of results, together with no position effect for off errors, is consistent with the notion that conjunction errors are more likely between colors and letters in adjacent positions than in nonadjacent positions.\n\nThe possibility of an adjacency effect is important because Wolford's feature perturbation model predicts that features are more likely to perturbate over short distances than long distances (Wolford, 1975). We tested directly for an adjacency effect by comparing the number of on errors where subjects gave the color of an adjacent vs nonadjacent letter with the stimuli with three different colors. Since the expected probability of an adjacent error is twice the probability of a nonadjacent error with three-color displays, the number of nonadjacent 012 errors was doubled for each subject. Subjects made significantly more on errors by responding with the color of an adjacent letter than with the color of a nonadjacent letter, 9.58 vs 5.58 (F(1,ll) = 9.95, p < .Ol). A more conservative test for an adjacency effect can be made by examining only stimuli with the target in either the first or third position. This would be a test of adjacency that is independent of the position effect on conjunction errors. When considered this way, subjects were no more likely to respond with the color of the adjacent letter (middle letter) than the nonadjacent letter. In this analysis the number of adjacent and nonadjacent errors was 6.75 vs 5.83 (F(l,ll) = 1.25, n.s.). Hence, this experiment provides only weak evidence for Wolford's feature perturbation theory. It should be pointed out, however, that this latter test is very conservative in that it only considered 4/9 of the stimuli (three-colored stimuli, with the target in the first or third position) and these were the stimuli with which subjects made the fewest conjunction errors (i.e., the target in the first or third position.)\n\nThe measure used in the second analysis of conjunction errors does not necessitate the assumption that the proportion of feature errors is the same for words and nonwords. In this analysis we examined the percentage of errors that were olt errors in excess of what is expected by chance. Specifically, Pco*j = Olt [ on + OJf--E(on) x 100 I where Pcoti is the estimated percentage of on errors that are conjunction errors; OIZ and offare the number of 012 and off errors, respectively; and E(on) is the expected proportion of on errors by chance. For this analysis, P,,,j was calculated individually for each subject. A value of .555 was used for E(on). The value for E(on) was derived as follows: With three-color stimuli if subjects make no conjunction errors, two thirds of the errors will be 012 errors by chance. With two-colored stimuli, two thirds of the errors will be 012 errors by chance. Since two thirds of the stimuli had three different colors and one third of the stimuli had two different colors, the expected proportion of 012 errors is (2/3) (2/3) + (l/3) (l/3) = 555. The means of these percentages are presented in Table 1. The absolute magnitude of these percentages is probably too small (many are negative), because our guessing constant, E(on>, was too large for reasons discussed below. The only important assumption in this analysis is that the correction for guessing, E(on), is the same for words and nonwords. Hence the important result is the difference in means between words and nonwords, not the absolute magnitude of these percentages. The percentage of on errors in excess of what was expected by chance, P,,,j, differed significantly for words and nonwords, 8.08 vs -6.75% (F( 1,ll) = 18.54, p < .Ol). This percentage also significantly varied as a function of target position (F(2,22) = 7.07, p < .Ol), with P,,,j highest with the target in the middle position. The pattern of results was the same as with the on errors, and is consistent with the notion that conjunction errors are more likely between a letter and the color of an adjacent letter than the color of a nonadjacent letter. The interaction of target position x stimulus type was not significant (F(2,22) = 0.53).\n\nThe results of this experiment can be succinctly summarized as follows. The percentage of errors where subjects guessed a color that was not part of the stimulus display (off errors) did not differ for words and nonwords. The percentage of errors where subjects incorrectly reported a color that was part of the display was greater for words than for nonwords (on errors). Finally, the percentage of on errors corrected for guessing was also greater for words than for nonwords. Our interpretation of these results is that subjects were less likely to correctly combine color and letter-shape information in words than in nonwords. Our claim is that the cognitive or linguistic properties that make words perceptual units adversely affected the integration of color and letter-shape information. This is consistent with the notion that short familiar words are processed as a unit, or at least that they are processed by units larger than single letters.\n\nThe finding that more conjunction errors occurred with words than with nonwords constitutes a kind of \"word-inferiority effect.\" The word-superiority effect is, of course, the finding that letter discrimination is better in words than in nonwords (Reicher, 1969). The word-superiority effect is not an issue in the present experiment, however, because the subjects, by design, were nearly perfect in letter recognition for words and for nonwords. Furthermore, the interesting result concerns inferior performance with word stimuli. There are a few studies showing worse performance for word stimuli than for nonword stimuli that do not make reference to feature integration. These studies need to be considered as potential alternative explanations for our results.\n\nFirst, our results could be considered a kind of Stroop effect. In our task subjects had to name the color of the ink in which a target letter was presented. Perhaps the poor performance with words is caused by the same mechanism that causes interference in a Stroop task. Klein (1964) has found that the time to name the ink color of common words was longer than the time to name the color of nonwords, even when the stimulus words were not color words. The problem with the Stroop explanation of our results is that it predicts overall worse performance for words than for nonwords. In the present experiment the subjects made more on errors with words than with nonwords, but the frequency of off errors did not vary with letter-string type.\n\nA second alternative is that our experiment is a kind of hidden figures task and that words more effectively hide the color of the target letter than nonwords. In this explanation, words are conceived of as good figures and nonwords are conceived of as less good figures. Banks and Prinzmetal (1976) and others have demonstrated that it is more difficult to discriminate target items that are a part of good figures than targets that are part of poorer figures (Mermelstein, Banks, & Prinzmetal, 1979;Millspaugh, 1978;Prinzmetal & Banks, 1977). Lawry (1980) has described a word interference effect in letter identification in exactly these terms. The hidden figures explanation is similar to our explanation in several ways. First, both explanations conceive of words, or groups of letters in words, as a kind of perceptual unit that is analogous to the perceptual units described by the Gestalt laws. In both explanations, interference is a function of being part of a multiletter \"good\" unit. The hidden figures explanation fails to describe the present results, however, for the same reason that the Stroop explanation fails. If target colors are hidden by the word context, then this should increase the frequency of both on errors and off errors. The fact that there were not more off errors for words than for nonwords in this experiment demonstrates that the problem was not so much that the target's color was hidden in words, the problem was knowing which color in the word belonged to the target letter. In Treisman and Schmidt's (1982) terms, subjects made as many feature errors in words as in nonwords, but more conjunction errors with words. Although hidden figures effects and Stroop effects undoubtedly play a role in some experiments with word and nonword stimuli, they do not provide a good account of the present data. Other potential alternative explanations for our effect are discussed in Experiment 2.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Experiment 1 was the finding that on errors varied as a function of target position and this position effect could be explained by more conjunction errors between adjacent than nonadjacent positions. This is interesting because it is exactly what one would expect from Wolford's feature perturbation model (Wolford, 1975). According to this model, features are more likely to perturbate to an adjacent position within a stimulus than to a distant position. The possibility that the position effect in this experiment can be explained by the effect of adjacency on illusory conjunctions is justified by the finding that there was no effect of target position with off errors, only with OIZ errors and P,,,j. Since the subjects were able to perceive the colors equally well in each position, the position effect only reflects illusory conjunctions. These speculations about position effects must be made with caution, however, because in this experiment target position is confounded with particular stimulus strings. Furthermore, we failed to find an adjacency effect that was independent of the high proportion of conjunction errors with the target in the middle position (i.e., in the analysis with the target in the end positions only). A final judgment on adjacency and position effects needs to await an examination of the position and adjacency results in the following experiments.\n\nFinally, one disconcerting aspect of our data is that although subjects made conjunction errors with words, our estimate of on errors in excess of what is expected by chance with nonwords was negative. P,,\"j was significantly greater than zero for words, 8.08% (F(l ,ll) = 13.11, p < .Ol). However, P,o\"j was less than zero for nonwords, -6.75%, and this was marginally significant (F(l ,ll) = 4.15, p =i .07). The negative P,,, is only an artifact of our method of correcting for guessing. The value that we subtracted for guessing, &on), assumes that when not enough color information is available subjects guess randomly. This guessing strategy would lead to nonoptimal performance because the majority of stimuli had three different colors. For example, if a subject did not know the target's color, but knew that one of the nontarget letters was purple, then purple would be a bad guess for the target's color. This problem would have been even greater if all of the stimuli used three different colors, and it is one reason why we included two-colored stimuli. With only one third of the stimuli having two colors, and no stimuli with just one color, optimal use of partial knowledge of the stimulus array should lead to more off errors and fewer on errors than is expected by chance. In fact, all of the experiments reported here are conservative in that the optimal strategy for subjects is not to guess randomly, but to use information from nontarget letters. To the extent that subjects use partial information optimally, the value subtracted for guessin&will be large and the absolute estimate of conjunction errors will be reduced. We do not know whether subjects made conjunction errors with the nonwords. We can only claim that subjects made significantly more conjunction errors with words than with nonwords, and that the proportion of on errors with words was significantly greater than would be expected by chance. Experiment 2 compares conjunction errors in words and nonwords without the necessity of estimating the expected proportion of on errors.\n\nEXPERIMENT 2\n\nThe purpose of Experiment 2 was to extend the finding of more conjunction errors in words than in nonwords in four ways. First, and most importantly, in Experiment 2 we used a detection task rather than a forced-choice task. This allows us to compare our results with those of Treisman and Schmidt (1982), extends our findings to a different paradigm, and allows an examination of a response bias explanation of our results. All of the stimuli contained the target letter \"P.\" Before each trial in this experiment, a color was verbally presented to the subject. Subjects had to respond \"yes\" or \"no\" whether a target letter (the letter P) occurred in the predesignated color. This task is similar to Treisman and Schmidt's Experiment 3 except that the target letter (P) was always the same in this experiment whereas it varied from trial to trial in their experiment. Pilot research with the same exposure conditions as this experiment indicated that subjects were nearly perfect in letter recognition as in Experiment 1, and therefore it was not necessary to test letter recognition. Furthermore, Experiment 3 and 4 used exactly the same exposure conditions and, as will be reported below, found near perfect performance on letter recognition. Since we were confident that there would be few letter recognition errors, for convenience we kept the same target letter from trial to trial.\n\nIn this experiment the most interesting prediction concerns trials on which the target letter P was not drawn in the predesignated color. On half of these target-absent trials the predesignated target color was not included in the display, and in half, it was the color of a nontarget letter. False alarms in the former condition will be termed FA,, and false alarms in the latter condition will be termed FA,,. FA,rrinclude only feature errors, whereas FA,, include feature and conjunction errors. Since there was an equal number of both kinds of target-absent trials, one might expect that if subjects do not make conjunction errors, FA,, and FA,, will be equal. However, if subjects use partial information about nontarget stimulus colors optimally, as suggested in Experiment 1, FA,, would be higher than FA,,. Therefore the absolute proportions of FA,, and FA,, are not important. The critical prediction is that there will be an interaction between the type of stimulus (word vs nonword) and the type of target-absent trial. Specifically, since FA,tronly includes feature errors, we predict no difference between words and nonwords in FA,. However, since FA,, includes conjunction errors as well as feature errors, FA,, should be greater for words than for nonwords.\n\nIn Experiment 1 the assumption was made that nonperceptual decision factors that might cause a subject to guess a color on vs off the stimulus display were the same for words and nonwords. In this experiment it is assumed that the tendency to respond \"yes\" arising from nonperceptual factors is the same for words and nonwords and a difference in FA,, can be attributed only to conjuction errors. This assumption can be tested by comparing FA,, and hit rates between words and nonwords. If the difference between FAon for words and nonwords is due to a bias to respond \"yes\" more often with words, then this response bias should also lead to higher hit and FA,,rates for words than for nonwords.\n\nThe second purpose of Experiment 2 was to compare words and nonwords when they were presented mixed together within a block rather than separately. The difference in conjunction errors between words and nonwords might have been due to some strategic difference in processing for words and nonwords. Perhaps subjects decide to spread their attention over all the letters when they expect words to be presented, but focus their attention on individual letters when they expect nonwords to be presented. If this is the case, then there would be more conjunction errors in words than nonwords only with blocked presentation. On the other hand, more conjunction errors with words in a mixed presentation experiment might present problems for an attentional explanation of conjunction errors where attention is thought of as being under volitional control. There are, however, attentional processes that are not completely under volitional control (e.g., the Stroop effect), and it may be possible to modify attentional theories (i.e., Treisman & Gelade, 1980) to accommodate a difference in conjunction errors in words and nonwords with mixed block presentation.\n\nThe third goal of this experiment was to eliminate any possible artifact due to eye movements. Since eye movements were not monitored in Experiment 1 it is impossible to determine whether they were either quantitatively or qualitatively different for words and nonwords. In the present experiment, exposure durations were set faster than the time needed to initiate and complete a saccadic eye movement. In order to maintain the same overall level of accuracy as in Experiment 1, the stimuli were placed slightly closer to the fixation point.\n\nFinally, we wanted to extend our findings to a wider range of stimulus\n\nTABLE 2 Color-Identification Errors: Experiment 2 Words Nonwords Target position 1 2 3 Mean 1 2 3 Mean Hits .79 .81 .76 .79 .80 .79 .75 .78 F&i+' .I1 .lO .14 .12 .lO .13 .13 .12 F&n6 .16 .19 .11 .I5 .07 .I1 .06 .08\n\na The proportion of false alarms when the target color was not included in the stimulus display b The proportion of false alarms when the target color was included in the stimulus display.\n\nmaterial because we only tested six words in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2 we used a different set of words and nonwords to ensure that the results of Experiment 1 were not due to some idiosyncracy of the particular displays that we used (cf. Paap & Newsome, 1980).\n\nThis experiment differed from Experiment 1 only in the following respects. Before each trial the experimenter verbally presented a color to the subject. The subject's task was to indicate whether the target letter P was drawn in the predesignated color. The stimulus set consisted of the following words and corresponding nonwords: PIE, PLF; SPY, BPT; MAP, NVP. Word and nonword trials were randomly mixed within a block in this and in all of the remaining experiments. The same 108 color sequences were used that were described in Experiment 1, giving 108 word and 108 nonword stimuli. Each stimulus was used three times in the experiment-one time the predesignated color was the target color; one time it was a nontarget color that was included in the display; and one time it was a color not present in the display. Hence, two thirds of the trials were target-absent trials. The stimuli were drawn as before except they were slightly closer to the fixation point. The distance from the fixation point to the nearest edge of the letter string was 1.7 cm (0.90\" visual angle). The exposure durations used in the experimental trials ranged from 60 to 200 ms, with a mean of 170 ms. There were 12 subjects in this and in each experiment.\n\nThe proportion of hits, FA,, and FA,,, are presented in Table 2. In the analysis of FA,, word and nonwords did not differ (F( 1,ll) = 0.04, MS, = 0.26792 x 10e3). The proportion of FA,, was .12 for both words and nonwords. The proportion of FA,, also did not differ as a function of target position, F(2,22) = 2.21, MS, = 0.23080 x lo,-* nor was the target position by stimulus-type interaction significant, F(2,22) = 2.23, MS, = 0.15073 x 10-2.\n\nAs predicted, words and nonwords only differed in the proportion of false alarms where the target color was included in the stimulus display (FA,,). The FA,, proportion was almost twice as great for words than for nonwords, .15 vs .08 (F(l,ll) = 92.39, p < .OOl). In the analysis of FA,, the effect of target position was also significant, (F(2,22) = 12.85, p < .OOl). The FA,, rate for the target letter in the first, second, and third positions was .12, .15, and .09, respectively. The interaction between target position and stimulus type was not significant, F(2,22) = 1.31. The greater number of FA,, when the target was in the center position, together with no position effect for FA,,, is suggestive of an adjacency effect since the center target position has two neighbors. We tested for an adjacency effect by comparing the number of false alarms when the target color was adjacent to the target letter vs nonadjacent to the target letter with stimuli with three different colors. As in Experiment 1, since the expected probability of an adjacent error is twice that of a nonadjacent error, the number of nonadjacent errors was doubled for each subject. There were more false alarms when the predesignated color was adjacent to the target letter, F(l,ll) = 38.22, p < .OOl. The mean number of adjacent and nonadjacent errors was 9.08 vs 4.67 for words and 4.5 vs 3.0 for nonwords (the nonadjacent values have been doubled). When we considered only trials in which the target was in one of the end positions, subjects were still more likely to make a false alarm when the target color was in the adjacent (middle) position than when it was in the nonadjacent (end) position, 5.3 vs 3.8, t = 2.07, p < .05. As can be seen in the analysis of hits below, this adjacency effect probably cannot be explained in terms of a greater tendency to respond \"yes\" when the predesignated color was in the center position.\n\nFinally, hit rate was not different for words and nonwords (F( 1,ll) = 0.04, MS, = 0.23645 x 10e2). The hit rates for words and nonwords were .79 and .78, respectively. Furthermore, it did not vary as a function of target position, F(2,22) = 2.46, MS, = 0.63326 x 10P2), nor was the interaction of target position and stimulus type significant (F(2,22) = .55, MS, = 0.30630 x 10-2).\n\nExperiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 using different stimulus material, a different task, and mixed instead of blocked presentation. When the predesignated target color was included in the display as a nontarget color, the subjects were more likely to make a false alarm with words than with nonwords. When the target color was not in the display there was no difference in false alarm rate between words and nonwords. Our interpretation of these results is that subjects were more likely to combine incorrectly letter-shapes and colors in words than in nonwords because words constitute a perceptual unit or contain units larger than single letter.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that our results do not reflect a perceptual difference between the processing of words and nonwords, but rather reflect a difference in response bias. The simplest response bias hypothesis is that subjects have a greater bias to respond \"yes\" to words than to nonwords. This hypothesis is easy to refute because it would predict both higher FAOrr and hit rates with words than with nonwords, and this was not the case. It is possible to construct a complex response bias hypothesis that could account for our results, but the number of required bias parameters would proliferate. At a minimum, a different response parameter would be required for words and nonwords to account for FA,,\", but not for FAorr or hits. We cannot refute a many parametered response bias model, but such a model does not have a psychological motivation and is descriptive at best (cf. Keren & Baggen, 1981;Townsend & Ashby, 1982).\n\nThe finding that more conjunction errors occurred with words than nonwords with a mixed rather than blocked presentation indicates that a blocked stimulus presentation is not necessary for the effect. However, these results by themselves are not strong evidence that feature integration could not be affected by subject strategies. There are several demonstrations that letter recognition in words and in pronounceable pseudowords is affected by subjects' expectancy of the type of stimulus (Aderman & Smith, 1971;Can-, Davidson, & Hawkins, 1978;Manelis, 1974). It might be that if blocked and mixed presentation were compared within an experiment, or if a few words were thrown in the end of a block of all nonwords, there would be an expectancy effect on conjunction errors. The difference between words and nonwords in this experiment indicates that even when subjects do not know whether a word or nonword will be presented, processing is nevertheless different for word and nonwords. The picture is of an active perceptual parser that discovers appropriate units of analysis when presented with a stimulus string.\n\nFinally, one might have expected that the hit rate in this experiment would have been higher for nonwords than for words. This would be because on some target-present trials subjects might correctly perceive the target color, but incorrectly combine it with a nontarget item leading to a miss. Since we predicted more conjunction errors with words than nonwords, this should happen more often with words. Unfortunately, in this experiment there is no way of knowing whether conjunction errors contribute to the miss rate. We can not partition target-present trials into those where conjunction errors are possible and those where conjunction errors are not possible as was done with false alarms. It might be that conjunction errors do not contribute to the miss rate substantially. For example, subjects might attempt to attend to the target color (e.g., purple), and the target letter (P), and when these coincide, attention is sufficiently focused so that nontarget colors do not get considered. An-other possibility is that a feature error and a lucky conjunction error could lead to a hit. More of these fortuitous conjunction errors with words than nonwords would raise the hit rate with words. In any case, the fact that hits did not vary with letter-string type does not affect our conclusion with regard to FA,,.4 The remaining experiments attempt to isolate the properties of words that enable them to be processed by multiletter units.\n\nEXPERIMENT 3\n\nWords as a class of stimuli can be characterized in two broad ways (Manelis, 1974). On the one hand, words are pronounceable and they conform to the spelling rules of English. On the other hand, words comprise familiar and meaningful unitary lexical entries. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether pronounceability and orthographic regularity can affect feature integration independent of familiarity and meaningfulness. We compared words, pronounceable and orthographically regular pseudowords, and unpronounceable nonwords in the task used in Experiment 1. This experiment asked two questions. First, the finding that there are more conjunction errors in pseudowords than in nonwords would support the claim that orthographic regularity and/or pronounceability can affect feature integration. In these experiments we cannot and do not distinguish the effects of orthographic regularity and pronounceability (cf. Baron & Thurston, 1973). Second, more conjunction errors in words than in pseudowords would indicate that the lexical properties of words, over and above the effect of pronounceability, affect feature integration (cf. Baron & Thurston, 1973;Joula, Leavitt, & Choe, 1974;Manelis, 1974).\n\nThis experiment used the same paradigm as Experiment 1 except that the stimuli were presented in mixed blocks and the distance from the fixation point was the same as in Experiment 2. Subjects were briefly presented words, pronounceable pseudowords, and nonwords that always contained either the target letter R or the target letter N. The subjects responded whether the string contained the target letter R or the target letter N, and also identified the color of the target. There were 108 word, pseudoword, and nonword stimuli and each stimulus was presented twice, giving 648 trials per subject. There were 12 blocks of 54 trials per block. The words used in this experiment were NAG, RAG, ANT, ART, FUN, and FIR. The pseudowords were NEC, REC, ENK, ERK, LON, and LOR. The nonwords were NHD, RHD, HNF, HRF, TDF, and TDR. The exposure durations were set as in the previous experiments and ranged from 50 to 200 ms, with a mean of 147 ms.\n\n4 We compared words and nonwords with d' scores derived in two ways. When d' was calculated with FA,and hit rate, words and nonwords did not differ, 2.00 vs 1.98, t( 11) = 0.46. When d' was calculated with FA,, and hit rate, performance was worse with words, 1.83 vs 2.02, t(l1) = 7.69, p < .OOl. We offer this analysis with the admonition that signal detection theory may not be appropriate in this experiment.\n\nlhrget position 1\n\nTABLE 3 Color Identification Errors: Experiment 3 Words Pseudowords Nonwords 2 3 Mean 1 2 3 Mean 1 2 3 Mean On errors\" 10.88 14.00 9.14 11.34 9.72 14.81 9.14 11.22 6.71 10.07 5.90 7.56 ofl erred 6.25 5.79 6.13 6.06 6.48 5.67 5.90 6.02 6.13 5.79 5.79 5.90 PW$ 6.54 12.49 2.15 7.06 3.32 15.33 2.60 7.08 -4.25 7.78 -4.70 -.39\n\n' The percentage of trials on which subjects responded with a nontarget color that was included in the display.\n\n* The percentage of trials on which subjects incorrectly responded with a color not in the display. c The percentage of on errors in excess of what is expected by chance.\n\nSubjects were nearly perfect at discriminating the target letter (N and R). Less than 0.5% of the trials involved letter discrimination errors and these were evenly distributed between words, pseudowords, and nonwords. Subjects incorrectly reported the target's color on approximately 16% of the trials. As in Experiment 1, the data were analyzed separately for the percentage of errors in which subjects responded with a color not included in the stimulus array (offerrors), the percentage of errors where subjects responded with a color included in the stimulus array, but not the target color (on errors), and finally the percentage of 012 errors in excess of what is expected by chance (Pcoti). These data are presented in Table 3.\n\nThere was no difference in off errors as a function of type of stimulus (words vs pseudowords vs nonwords), F(2,22) = 0.08, MS, = 3.01855. The percentages of off errors were 6.06, 6.02, and 5.90 for words, pseudowords, and nonwords, respectively. off errors did not vary as a function of target position, F(2,22) = 0.42, MS, = 6.36022, nor was the interaction of stimulus type and target position significant, F(4,44) = 0.04, MS, = 7.07629.\n\nThe percentage of on errors did differ as a function of stimulus type (F(2,22) = 14. II, p < .001). The percentages of on errors for words, pseudowords, and nonwords were 11.34, 11.22, and 7.56%, respectively. Words and pseudowords each significantly differed from nonwords, t( 11) = 4.08 and 4.25, respectively, p < .OOl. However, words and pseudowords did not differ significantly from each other, t(l1) = 0.19. These results, together with the lack of differences in off errors, indicate that subjects made more errors in correctly combining color and letter-shape information in words and pseudowords than in nonwords.\n\nThe percentage of OIZ errors also differed significantly as a function of target position (F(2,22) = 15.86, p < .OOl). The percentages of 012 errors for targets in the first, middle, and last positions were 9.10, 12.96, and 8.06%, respectively. Target position did not significantly interact with the type of stimulus (F(4,44) = 0.34). As in the previous experiments, the greater number of OIZ errors in the middle target position suggested an adjacency effect, so we compared the number of adjacent to nonadjacent errors with those stimuli that had three different colors. The number of nonadjacent errors were doubled for each subject as before. The mean number of times subjects responded with the color of an adjacent letter was 12.38 and the mean number of times subjects responded with the color of a nonadjacent color was 8.88 (after doubling each value). This difference was reliable, F(l,ll) = 22.63, p < .OOl, and it did not interact with the type of stimulus, F(2,22) = 0.21. However, considering trials with the target only in one of the end positions, subjects were no more likely to respond with an adjacent than nonadjacent color, 13.6 vs 13.2, F(l,ll) < 1.0.\n\nFinally, we analyzed the percentage of 012 errors in excess of what would be expected by chance (P,,\"j) as was done in Experiment 1. The results exactly paralleled the results with on errors. Words, pseudowords, and nonwords significantly differed (F(l,ll) = 3.52, p < .05). For words, pseudowords, and nonwords P,,,j was 7.06, 7.08, and -0.39%, respectively. Words and pseudowords each differed significantly from nonwords, t(l1) = 2.63 and 2.05, p < .05, respectively. However, words and pseudowords did not differ, t( 11) = 0.007. P,,,j also differed significantly as a function of target position in the same way as 012 errors, F(2,22) = 5.52, p < .05. Target position did not interact with the type of stimulus, F(4,44) = 0.18.\n\nExperiment 3 replicated the previous experiments in that subjects were more likely to combine incorrectly color and letter-shape information in words than in nonwords. In addition, subjects were more likely to incorrectly combine color and letter-shape information with pseudowords than with nonwords. This indicates that pronounceability and/or orthographic regularity affect feature integration. A letter string can form a unit because of its pronounceability or orthographic regularity.\n\nThe lack of a difference in conjunction errors between words and pseudowords could be taken as evidence that the meaningfulness and familiarity of words does not affect feature integration. This conclusion would be incorrect for two reasons. First, one should not be too hasty to embrace the null hypothesis. In the word-superiority effect literature, Baron and Thurston (1973) found no difference in letter recognition between words and pseudowords and therefore concluded that only orthographic regularity was responsible for the word superiority effect. Subsequent studies have found significantly better letter recognition in words than in pseudowords (Joula et al., 1974;Manelis, 1974). Second, both pronounceability and meaningfulness may affect feature integration, but the effects may not be additive. The presence of one or the other may be sufficient to cause the stimulus display to be processed as a unit. For these reasons, had we found a difference between words and pseudowords, it would have suggested that the lexical properties of words, such as familiarity or meaningfulness, affect feature integration. The null result is not conclusive, however, and this question is examined further in Experiments 4 and 5.\n\nEXPERIMENT 4\n\nIn this experiment we compared performance with abbreviations which were both familiar and meaningful to our subjects with meaningless unfamiliar nonwords. This is a direct test of whether the lexical properties of words (familiarity and meaningfulness) affect feature integration. Gibson, Bishop, Schiff, and Smith (1964) demonstrated that recognition thresholds are lower for familiar abbreviations than for meaningless and unfamiliar trigrams. Henderson (1974) found that same-different reaction time was faster for familiar meaningful abbreviations than unfamiliar meaningless letter strings. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether familiarity and/or meaningfulness, independent of pronounceability, would affect feature integration, If familiar meaningful letter strings are at some level processed as a unit, then there should be more conjunction errors in familiar abbreviations than in unfamiliar nonwords. In this experiment, we cannot distinguish meaningfulness and familiarity as all of the abbreviations were chosen to be both familiar and meaningful to our subjects.\n\nIn this experiment we used the same task as Experiments 1 and 3 with the following exception. Since it was difficult to find familiar abbreviations that could be used in a twoalternative, forced-choice task, the stimulus strings either contained the target letter C or they did not. The subject's task was, first, to respond whether the target letter was present, and second, if the target letter was present, they were to report its color. The abbreviations that we used were CBS, PBS, RCA, RNA, NYC, and NYU. The nonwords were CKB, PKB, PCV, PNV, HTC, and HTU. In a pilot study with our subject population, the abbreviations were all given high familiarity ratings, and the nonwords were all given low ratings. There were 108 abbreviations and 108 nonword stimuli. Each target-present abbreviation and nonword stimulus was used twice, and each target-absent stimulus was used only once per subject. Hence, the target letter was present on two thirds of the trials. Subjects were tested for 12 blocks of 54 trials per block. Exposure durations were set as before and ranged from 80 to 200 ms with a mean of 173 ms. In all other respects this experiment was exactly like Experiment 3.\n\nOut of a total of 5184 trials with the target letter C present, there were only nine letter recognition misses (three for abbreviations, six for nonwords). Out of a total of 2592 trials without the target letter C, there were only eight letter recognition false alarms (four abbreviations and four for nonwords). Hence subjects made letter recognition errors on only 0.2% of the trials. Although we know of no letter recognition study comparing accuracy with abbreviations and nonwords, as there is with words, pseudowords, and nonwords, it seems possible that there may be an \"abbreviation superiority effect\" waiting to be discovered. However, in this experiment abbreviations and nonwords did not differ in terms of letter recognition. The limit on perfc,mance was not in determining whether the stimulus string contained the target letter, but was in determining the target's color.\n\nSubjects incorrectly identified the target color on 17.4% of the trials. As before, the data were analyzed separately for the percent of on errors, off errors, and P,,,j. The data are summarized in Table 4.\n\nThe percentage of off errors was not significantly different for abbreviations and nonwords (F( 1,ll) = 0.63, MS, = 2.0727). The mean percentages of offerrors for abbreviations and nonwords were 7.41 and 7.14, respectively. For the first time in the present research, there was a significant effect of target position in the analysis of off errors, F(2,22) = 6.18, p < .Ol, with worse performance when the target was in the middle position. The interaction of stimulus type and target position was not significant, F(2,22) = 0.53. This indicates that the colors were harder to perceive in the middle position for both words and nonwords.\n\nThe percentage of on errors was significantly greater for abbreviations\n\nTABLE 4 Color Identification Errors: Experiment 4 Abbreviation Unfamiliar nonwords Target position 1 2 3 Mean 1 2 3 Mean On error@ 10.88 15.39 9.26 11.84 6.48 11.57 1.29 8.45 Off errorsb 7.29 9.26 5.61 7.41 6.02 9.14 6.25 7.14 pconjc 5.02 5.24 5.11 5.12 -2.27 -1.91 -1.79 -1.99\n\nn The percentage of trials on which subjects responded with a nontarget color that was included in the display.\n\nb The percentage of trials on which subjects incorrectly responded with a color not in the display.\n\nc The percentage of on errors in excess of what is expected by chance.\n\nthan for nonwords, 11.84 vs 8.45 (F(l,ll) = 30.77, p < .OOl). On errors varied significantly as a function of target position, F(2,22) = 12.34, p < JOI, with worse performance with the target in the middle position. The interaction of target position and stimulus type was not significant (F(2,22) = 1.01). Unfortunately, unlike Experiments 1 to 3, the effect of target position on OIZ errors cannot be attributed solely to illusory conjunctions because target position also affected off errors. As in the previous experiments, an examination of 012 errors with the stimuli with three colors showed an adjacency effect. Subjects were significantly more likely to report the color of the item adjacent to the target (F(1 ,11) = 7.61, p < .05). The mean numbers of adjacent and nonadjacent on errors were 12.67 and 9.0 (the nonadjacent numbers have been doubled). However, when we included in the analysis only those trials where the target was in an end position, subjects were only slightly, and nonsignificantly, more likely to give the color of an adjacent rather than distant item, 9.3 vs 8.8, F(l,ll) < 1.0. Since there was an effect of target position with feature errors (e.g., offerrors) in this experiment, the adjacency effect is not attributable solely to conjunction errors. If there are overall more errors with the target in the center position, which is adjacent to two items, then subjects will necessarily make more adjacent than nonadjacent errors.\n\nFinally, Pconj was significantly greater for abbreviations than nonwords, 5.12 vs -1.99% (F(1,ll) = 11.51, p < .Ol). Neither target position, nor interaction of target position and stimulus type was not significant (both F's < 1.0). This reinforces our interpretation that in this experiment, at least, the effect of target position cannot be explained in terms of more conjunction errors when the target was in the center position. The position effect can be more parsimoniously explained by more feature errors in the center position.\n\nThis experiment extends our findings to familiar, meaningful trigrams. Our interpretation is that familiar but unpronounceable letter strings are at some stage of analysis processed as a perceptual unit whereas unfamiliar nonwords are not. This experiment, together with Experiment 3, indicates that the perceptual parser is sensitive to both orthographic regularity and familiarity.\n\nThe results of this experiment differed from the previous experiments in that target position affected offerrors and thus we cannot attribute the target position effect to a greater probability of feature perturbations between adjacent items. There are several reasons why this experiment may have differed from the previous experiments. First, data were collected on only six letter strings for color errors (three abbreviations and three nonwords), and perhaps there was something unique about these strings. Also, the off error rate was much higher in this experiment than the previous experiments, and perhaps with a higher error rate, lateral interactions make it harder to process feature information in the center position.\n\nEXPERIMENT 5\n\nThe final experiment had three goals. First, we wished to extend the finding in Experiment 4 of more conjunction errors in abbreviations than in nonwords to a new set of stimuli. Experiment 4 only compared three abbreviations to three nonwords for 012 and off errors. The present experiment compared a new set of six abbreviations and six nonwords. Second, we examined the role of including a vowel in the letter string. In the previous experiments most of the meaningful and/or pronounceable letter strings included vowels and most of the nonwords did not. In this experiment, we test whether the presence of a vowel is necessary or sufficient to influence feature integration. There is evidence that in the word-superiority effect the presence of a vowel may play a critical role (Spoehr & Smith, 1975). Half of the abbreviations and half of the nonwords included one vowel and half did not. We also included pseudowords in this experiment in order to compare pseudowords to nonwords with and without vowels. Finally, this experiment gives another opportunity to examine whether the serial target position effect can be explained by local feature perturbations.\n\nWe adopted the following procedure because it was difficult to select familiar abbreviations, nonwords, and pseudowords that could be used in a two-alternative, forced-choice task, and because we wanted to collect data on a larger sample of letter strings than in Experiment 4. Each letter string contained the target letter G and the subject's task was to report its color. Unfortunately, this procedure did not allow us to measure letter recognition errors. However, in Experiments 1, 3, and 4, subjects made letter recognition errors on less than 0.5% of the trials, so that we were confident that differences in letter recognition would not affect the results.\n\nSubjects were tested with three familiar abbreviations with vowels (GTE, PGA, EKG) and three familiar abbreviations without vowels (GNP, KGB, MPG). The stimulus set also included three nonwords letter strings with vowels (GBA, MGI, OTG) and three without vowels (GTR, PGR, NDG). Finally, the stimulus set included three pronounceable pseudowords (GRI, AGH, OLG). These letter strings were rated by 17 independent judges for familiarity and pronounceability on a IO-point scale. All of the abbreviations and nonwords were rated equally low on pronounceability (mean ratings were 3.5 and 3.3, respectively), while the pseudowords were rated high on pronounceability (7.3). The pseudowords and nonwords were rated equally low on familiarity (3.3 and 3.2, respectively), while the abbreviations were rated high on familiarity (7.5). There were 108 stimuli for each of the five letter-string types and each stimulus was used twice, yielding 1080 trials per subject.

In all other respects, this experiment was identical to Experiment 2.\n\nSubjects incorrectly identified the target's color on 13.3% of the trials. The percentages of on errors, off errors, and P,,\"j for each of the five stimulus types are presented in Table 5. Data on target position has been left out of the table for clarity, but the effect of target position is discussed below. The data analysis proceeded in three parts. First, we compared abbreviations and nonwords, with and without vowels, in a 2 x 2 design. Next, we compared pseudowords and nonwords. Finally, we examined target position and adjacency effects.\n\nIn a 2 x 2 ANOVA of percentage off errors, abbreviations and nonwords did not significantly differ, 4.79 vs 4.54% (F(l,ll) = 0.69, MS, = 1.0859). Furthermore the presence of a vowel did not have a significant effect. The percentage of off errors for nonwords and abbreviations with a vowel and those without a vowel was 4.54 vs 4.79% (F(l,ll) = 1.12, MS, = 0.67670). Finally the presence of a vowel did not interact with the type of stimulus string (F(l,ll) = 0.01, MS, = 0.43313).\n\nIn the analysis of 012 errors, subjects made significantly more errors with abbreviations than with nonwords, 9.59 vs 7.03%, F(l,ll) = 25.30, p < .OOl. The presence of a vowel did not have a significant effect, however. The percentage of olt errors for strings with and without vowels was 8.09 vs 8.53%, respectively, and this difference was not significant (F(1,ll) = 2.91). The interaction of stimulus string type and the presence of a vowel was also not significant (F(1 ,I 1) = 0.21).\n\nAs in the analysis of on errors, P,,nj was significantly higher for abbreviations than for nonwords, 10.35 vs 4.81% (F(l,ll) = 5.13, p < .OS). However, the presence of a vowel did not significantly affect P,,nj (F( 1,ll) = O.Ol), nor did the presence of a vowel interact with the type of stimulus (abbreviations vs nonwords, F(l,ll) = 0.35). To summarize the 2 x 2 analysis of abbreviations and nonwords, subjects made more 012 errors in abbreviations than in nonwords, Pconj was higher in abbreviations than nonwords, but there was no difference in off errors. The presence of vowels had no significanct effect in any of the analyses.\n\nNext, we compared pseudowords and nonwords. We had intended to compare pseudowords to nonwords with and without vowels separately. However, nonwords with and nonwords without vowels did not differ significantly in any of our measures (on errors, off errors, or P,o,j>, so we compared pseudowords to the mean of nonwords with vowels and without vowels. Pseudowords and nonwords did not significantly differ in the percentage of off errors (F(l ,ll) = .002, MS, = 1.3321). The percentages of off errors for pseudowords and nonwords were 4.55 and 4.53, respectively. The percentage of on errors and P,,,j were significantly greater for pseudowords than for nonwords, however. The percentages of on errors were 10.11 and 7.03 (F(l,ll) = 39.07, p < .Ol). The corresponding P,,,j were 13.33 and 4.81 (F(1,ll) = 12.32, p < .Ol). These results nicely replicate Experiment 3 with a different set of stimuli and demonstrate that the presence of vowels by themselves cannot explain the effect of pronounceability on feature integration. Target position was not an independent variable in any of the above analyses.\n\nFinally, we examined the effects of target position and adjacency in an analysis that included the five stimulus types and three target positions. The subjects were more likely to respond with the color of an item adjacent to the target than nonadjacent to the target (F(l,ll) = 4.93, p < .05). The number of adjacent and nonadjacent OIZ erors for stimuli with three different colors was 11.05 and 8.13, respectively (nonadjacent errors were doubled for each subject). However, when considering stimuli with the target only in the first and last positions, the difference between adjacent and nonadjacent color responses was not significant, 21.9 vs 20.6 for adjacent and nonadjacent responses, respectively (F( 1,ll) < 1 .O). The effect of target position was considerably different from the previous studies. Target position had significant effect with off errors, F(2,22) = 14.30, p < .OOl. Subjects made the fewest number of off errors with the target in the last position and this was true for each stimulus type. The mean percentage of off errors for the target in the first, middle, and last was 5.79, 5.37, and 2.75, respectively. In the analysis of on errors target position also had a significant effect (F(2,22) = 5.07, p < .05). Subjects made more on errors when the target was in the middle position. The mean percentages of on errors were 7.36, 10.32, and 8.31 for targets in the first, middle, and last positions, respectively. This pattern was consistent across the five stimulus types. Finally, Pconj also varied significantly across target position (F(2,22) = 9.62, p < .Ol). Pconj for the targets in the first, middle, and last positions were -1.19, 8.78, 19.54%. P,,,j was highest in the third target position for all tive stimulus types. The high proportion of P,,\"j for targets in the last position is a consequence of the low number of off errors for targets in that position. The interactions of stimulus type and target position were not significant with on errors, off errors, or P,,,j.  The pattern of results with target position makes sense if one assumes that the color of the target letter G was easier to see when it was in the last position. However, we know of no reason why this should have been true.\n\nExperiment 5 extended our previous findings in two ways. First, we replicated the effect of more conjunction errors with both pseudowords and meaningful abbreviations than with nonwords using different stimulus sets. Second, we demonstrated that the effect on feature integration with pseudowords and abbreviations in Experiments 3 and 4 cannot be explained by the presence of vowels.\n\nIn this experiment, we found no difference between stimuli with and without vowels with any of the measures that we used. However, it may be premature to conclude that vowels in letter strings make no difference in integrating color and letter-shape information. The presence of vowels is correlated with pronounceability and letter strings with vowels are generally more likely to be similar to words than letter strings without vowels. The abbreviations and nonwords used in this experiment were carefully selected to be unpronounceable and unlike words. In letter recognition, the effect of including a vowel in a letter string is unclear. Spoehr and Smith (1975) found that the addition of a vowel to a letter string containing orthographically regular consonant clusters improved performance. On the other hand, Rumelhart and McClelland (1982) found that the presence of a vowel in a letter string did not affect letter recognition if the letter strings shared letters with several words in all but one position. In any case, it may be premature to conclude that the presence of vowels has no effect on feature integration. The important finding in this experiment is that we obtained an effect of meaningfulness and of pronounceability on feature integration while controlling for the presence of a vowel.\n\nIn the context of the present discussion, it is interesting to compare our findings and approach to recent theories of word and letter recognition proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) and by Paap, Newsome, McDonald, and Schvaneveldt (1982). Both of these theories are impressive in that they predict letter recognition accuracy within the classes of words, pseudowords, and nonwords. According to these theories, letter recognition is related to the number of words in the lexicon that are \"friends\" of the stimulus. A friend is a word in the lexicon that shares three letters in identical positions with the stimulus string (for fourletter words) and also has the target letter in the correct position. Thus, in recognizing the first letter in the string SPCT, there are three friends (SPAT, SPIT, SPOT), but the string XPQJ has no friends. Rumelhart and McClelland (1982) found letter recognition better in strings like SPCT with several friends, than less word-like strings such as XPQJ. One reason for the success of this approach might be that letter strings with many friends are, average, more word-like than strings with few friends. Hence, the number of friends could be considered an index of wordiness. It would not be surprising if subjects made more conjunction errors with word-like strings which have many friends such as SPCT, than with strings that are not word-like and have no friends, such as XPQJ. All our nonwords were deliberately selected to not be word-like (i.e., they have few friends) and so this prediction cannot be tested with the present data. It should be noted, however, that although we can derive predictions from the models of Paap et al. and McClelland and Rumelhart, our approach differs theoretically from theirs. We have proposed that feature integration is affected by perceptual structure, and that word-like letter strings contain perceptual units larger than individual letters. We specifically allow for the possibility that multiletter units such as syllables or consonant clusters may influence perception, while their approach only makes reference to whole-word units in the lexicon.\n\nIn five experiments, the subjects made more errors in correctly integrating colors and shapes in orthographically regular and familiar letter strings than in irregular, meaningless nonwords. The greater probability of conjunction errors in word-like letter strings cannot be attributed to differences in feature extraction, because performance in these experiments was equated for letter and color identification errors. Furthermore, the differences in conjunction errors reflect perceptual rather than memory limitations since we used detection and search tasks that minimized memory requirements. Finally, our results cannot parsimoniously be explained in terms of response bias nor in terms of Stroop-like interference for words. Our account of these results is that words and wordlike stimuli are parsed into multiletter perceptual units, whereas letters in nonwords are less likely to form such multiletter units. The predictions were based on the general principle, suggested by Prinzmetal(1981), that features in different perceptual units are less likely to be combined than features within the same perceptual unit. If our explanation is correct, then these results demonstrate that familiar or pronounceable letter strings are at some level of analysis processed in multiletter chunks. These findings have implications for the study of both feature integration and word perception.\n\nFrom the present study, two conclusions can be drawn about feature integration. First, although color and shape are separable attributes, and under some circumstances subjects may incorrectly combine these attributes, it is incorrect to say that these stimulus features are \"freefloating.\" Feature integration was constrained by the stimulus. Our subjects were less likely to combine features from letter strings that do not form meaningful/pronounceable units than from letter strings that do form units. This is analogous to the finding that features from different perceptual units are constrained from joining (Prinzmetal, 1981). The research strategy implicit in our approach is that we can understand how the visual system correctly integrates stimulus attributes in normal perception by discovering the ways in which features are constrained and are not free floating. The second conclusion is that acquired stimulus properties, such as familiarity or pronounceability, can affect feature integration. It is probably not surprising that perceptual organization, as determined by Gestalt factors, influences feature integration. The visual world would be chaotic if features from different perceptual units or objects were not prevented from combining. The present research demonstrates that acquired or learned structure can have an analogous effect on feature integration.\n\nA model of word perception that is rejected by the present findings is that information flows unidirectionally in a hierachical manner from the analysis of features to letters, and finally to words. Although identifying the words was not part of our task, the word-like properties of the stimulus influenced performance. This observation is, of course, consistent with the word superiority effect where the word-like properties of a letter string influence the identification of letters. However, in the word-superiority effect it is not clear whether subjects base their response on the identity of the target letter or on the identity of the word. The flow of information could be unidirectional from features, to letters, to words with the subject's response based on the identity of the word (Johnson & McClelland, 1973;Paap et al., 1982). For example, if the subject identifies the whole word as AGE then the middle letter can not be the letter R, it must be the letter G. In the present experiments, however, knowing the letter string is the word AGE, provides no information about the color of the letter G. Nevertheless, word-like properties of the whole letter string influenced perception in these experiments.\n\nThe finding that feature integration is affected by factors such as orthographic structure, suggests that conjunction errors may be used to investigate particular perceptual units of analysis within words. There is some evidence for specific multiletter units such as syllables or consonant clusters. For example, Santa et al. (1977) found that the search time for spelling units within words (e.g., BL in BLAST) was less than the search time for strings that are not spelling units (e.g., LA in BLAST). Recently, Pring (1981) found in a lexical decision task that positive reaction times were faster and negative reaction times were slower when spelling units were presented in the same case (CHurCH) then when they were in different cases (ChuRCH). Although the present study was not designed to test between specific multiletter units of analysis, it may be that colors are more likely to be incorrectly combined within intraword units, such as syllables, then between units. If spelling units, morphological units, or syllables play a part in visual analysis, then these units should be reflected in the pattern of conjunction errors. For example, if a subject's task was to identify the color of the letter \"Y\" and the word MAYBE was briefly presented, then we would predict that subjects would incorrectly respond more often with the color of the M or A than the color of the B or E because the M and A are part of the same unit. We are presently exploring this possibility. This paradigm has an advantage over previous methods in that exactly the same targets and task can be used regardless of the unit of analysis being explored. In the paradigm used by Santa et al., for example, the size of the probe covaries with the size of the unit being investigated. If we find evidence that either consonant clusters, spelling units, syllables, or morphemes affect the pattern of conjunction errors within letter strings, it would strengthen our interpretation of the present results and provide converging evidence for the psychological reality of these units in an early stage of visual information processing.\n\nIt should be made clear that we are not proposing a specific processing theory of perceptual parsing or feature integration. Several different theories, such as Treisman's attentional account, could explain our results. Our approach is similar to the computational level of theory discussed by Mat-r (1982). Marr has proposed that theories of vision can be classified into three levels. First, the computational level simply asks (a) what does the visual system do that we want to understand, (b) what information is used, and (c) what constraints exist? The algorithm level of theory proposes specific processing procedures. Wolford's feature perturbation theory and Treisman's attentional theory are at the algorithm level of theory in that they are processing models. Finally, the implementation level of theory is concerned with the actualization of algorithms with devices such as neurons or computers. In this framework, our conjectures are at the computational level of theory. First, the general problem that we are interested in is how the visual system integrates information in perceptual analysis. In the present experiments, the specific problem is integrating letter-shape and color information. Second we suggest that information about the perceptual parsing of a stimulus array is used in feature integration. In these experiments the factors that enable letter strings to be processed as units affected feature integration. Finally, the constraint provided by information about perceptual organization is that features are more likely to combine within units than between units. In the present experiments, this led to the prediction that conjunction errors would be more likely in three-letter words, which probably form a unit, than in nonwords.\n\nOther sources of information may provide constraints for feature integration. For example, the location in visual space of features may provide information that is used in feature integration. The constraint would be that features with the same real world \"address\" belong to the same object and are conjoined. Wolford's feature perturbation theory uses location information for feature integration (Wolford, 1975). According to this theory, features are extracted with location information. Location information is lost with time so that features perturbate to neighboring locations. There are other theoretical possibilities that use location information. For example, perhaps location information does not decay with time, but with brief nonfoveal presentations location information is imperfectly obtained. Wolford's theory was developed to account for whole-report tasks, and it may be more appropriate in those experiments. The latter explanation may be more appropriate in search and detection tasks. Furthermore, Wolford modeled data where features were defined as constituents of letters, and in the present experiments features are defined as whole letters and colors. Nevertheless, it is important to consider what constitutes evidence that location information plays a role in feature integration. A natural prediction is that features would be more likely to be incorrectly combined from neighboring locations than distant locations. It is equally important to show that an adjacency effect cannot be explained by differences in feature errors in different display positions. Finally, there should be an adjacency effect independent of the position effect on conjunction errors. We obtained a pattern of results that is consistent with all of these stringent conditions only in Experiment 2. Furthermore, Treisman and Schmidt (1982) found no evidence for an adjacency effect. However, other studies have found evidence for what could be interpreted as an adjacency effect. For example, Snyder (1972) had subjects name the odd colored letter in a briefly presented array of 12 letters. When subjects erred, they were most likely to name a letter adjacent to the odd colored letter. In a whole-report task, Wolford and Shum (1980) presented subjects five squares with short line segments bisecting the sides of some of the squares. Wolford and Shum found that when the line segments were reported incorrectly, it was as if the line segment perturbated toward the center of the display from an adjacent square. Neither of these studies separated conjunction errors and feature errors, however. Hence, the question of an adjacency effect on illusory conjunctions remains. Nevertheless, it is clear from the findings of Prinzmetal (1981) and the present study, that if location provides information for feature integration, it does not provide the only source of information. The view we are advocating is that the visual system probably uses various sources of information such as redundancies in the visual world, location, and a syntactic description of the stimulus in terms of perceptual units (i.e., the output of a parser) to constrain the integration of features.\n\nThe predictions in the present study were based on an analogy between perceptual units determined by Gestalt factors (i.e., Prinzmetal, 1981) and multiletter units in word-like letter strings as determined by pronounceability and familiarity. Clearly the parsing algorithm that creates Gestalt units based on similarity is different from the algorithm that discovers \"units\" in pronounceable letter strings. The extention of the processing heuristic is justified, in part, because it has lead to interesting predictions. Nevertheless, the closeness of the analogy between units described by the Gestalt laws and linguistic structures in letter strings can certainly be questioned. The strength of the analogy is that both domains can be described by syntactic rule systems that are reflected in perceptual analysis. A meaningless visual pattern can be parsed by rules (descriptively called Gestalt principles) into constituents, just as a sentence can be parsed by grammatical rules into phrases. A letter string that forms a word in English can also be parsed with phonological and morphological rewrite rules into subword units (Venezky, 1967). Each of these syntactic systems involves some kind of elements (such as blobs or letters) and labeled relations between elements. The elements and relations in different syntactic systems surely differ. However, some labeled relations in different systems describe constituency relations. Elements may belong to the same or to different units or constituents. The perceptual units used by Prinzmetal and the word-like stimuli used in the present study both fit this category.\n\nOther more complex relations between elements exist that are unique to specific domains. For example, in scene analysis elements are not just members of objects, but the relation between elements may indicate that one element is above another. Letters in words also may be related to one another in ways unique to word perception. For example, Shallice and McGill (1978) reported that visual Spoonerisms (the perception of \"HARK LIVE\" as \"LARK HIVE\") were more common between visually similar than visually dissimilar words. It may be that these incorrect combinations are more likely between letters that have the same functional role in the words (Mozer, 1983). Speech errors also may exhibit special relations. MacKay found that incorrectly combined words generally ended in the same syllabic form (MacKay, 1972). An examination of illusory conjunctions might reveal more complex syntactic relations that are unique to particular stimulus domains. In any stimulus domain where structural relations play a role in perception, these relations may provide constraints for the integration of stimulus attributes.\n\nThere are, of course, both statistical and logical reasons for caution in accepting the null hypothesis. In this paper, the only instance where acceptance of the null hypothesis is critical is in the claim of an equal number of oflerrors between letter string types. Therefore, in each experiment the analysis of off errors includes the MS, so that the interested reader can calculate the power of the test with whatever critical difference seems appropriate. In all of the experiments, except in Experiment 5 where indicated, the MS, was derived from an analysis of variance that included letter-string type and target position. The MS, should be adjusted if tables of ,power that assume one source of variance are used (e.g.,Cohen, 1977).\n\nThe absolute magnitude of Pconj is dependent on the value chosen for E(W). Since different values of E(on) only represent linear transformations of the data, the choice of E(on), and the subsequent absolute magnitudes of Peon,, will not affect the analysis."
