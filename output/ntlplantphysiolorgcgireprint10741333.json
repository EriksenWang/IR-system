    "abstract": "A cationic peroxidase, PO-C1 (molecular mass 42 kD, isoelectric point 8.6), which is induced in incompatible interactions between the vascular pathogen Xanfhomonas oryzae pv oryzae and rice (Oryza sativa l.), was purified. Amino acid sequences from chemically cleaved fragments of PO-C1 exhibited a high percentage of identity with deduced sequences of peroxidases from rice, barley, and wheat. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to an 1 1-amino acid oligopeptide (POCla) that was derived from a domain where the sequence of the cationic peroxidase diverged from other known peroxidases. The anti-POC1 a antibodies reacted only with a protein of the same mobility as PO-C1 in extracellular and guttation fluids from plants undergoing incompatible responses collected at 24 h after infection. In the compatible responses, the antibodies did not detect PO-C1 until 48 h after infection. lmmunoelectron microscopy was used to demonstrate that PO-C1 accumulated within the apoplast of mesophyll cells and within the cell walls and vessel lumen of xylem elements of plants undergoing incompatible interactions.",
    "full_text": "Peroxidases (EC 1.1 1.1.7, H,O, oxidoreductase) have been implicated in the regulation of plant cell elongation (Goldberg et al., 1986), phenol oxidation (Schmid and Feucht, 19801, polysaccharide cross-linking (Fry, 1986), IAA oxidation (Beffa et al., 19901, cross-linking of extensin monomers (Everdeen et al., 1988), oxidation of hydroxycinnamyl alcohols into free radical intermediates (Gross, 19801, and wound healing (Espelie et al., 1986). Increases in peroxidases have been correlated with resistance in many species, including barley, cucurbits, cotton, tobacco, wheat, and rice (Oryza sativa L.). In these interactions the enzyme is involved in the polymerization of proteins and lignin or suberin precursors into plant cell walls (Ride, 1983;Mohan and Kolattukudy, 1990;Bradley et al., 19921, thus constructing a physical barrier that could prevent pathogen penetration of cell walls or movement through vessels. In addition, the free radical intermediates produced by peroxidase oxidative activity are toxic to pathogens (Sutherland, 1991).\n\nIn resistant or incompatible interactions between rice and the bacterial blight pathogen, Xanthomonas oyzae pv oryzae, increases in the activities of three extracellular peroxidases (two anionic [PO-A1 and PO-A2] and one cationic [PO-Cl]) have been correlated with the accumulation of lignin-like compounds, a reduction in bacterial multiplication in the leaves, and the onset of the HR (Reimers and Leach, 1991;Reimers et al., 1992;Guo et al., 1993). Activity of the cationic peroxidase PO-C1 increased more dramatically with the onset of resistance when compared with the two anionic peroxidases (Reimers et al., 1992). The timing and dynamics of the events leading to the HR are dependent on the specific X. oryzae pv oryzae avirulence gene and rice resistance gene involved in the interaction. In interactions involving strains of X. oyzae pv oryzae with the avirulence gene avrXaZ0 and rice cultivars with the corresponding resistance gene (Xa-101, an increase in PO-C1 activity is observed within 16 to 24 h, and the HR is visible at 24 h (Hopkins et al., 1992; Guo et al., 1993; Leach et al.,  1993). In the incompatible interactions involving X. oryzae pv oryzae with avrXa7 and rice with Xa-7, the increase in PO-Cl occurred between 24 and 48 h after inoculation and symptoms of the HR were delayed (48-72 h). PO-C1 does not accumulate until48 to 72 h after infection in susceptible or compatible interactions. The tissues in these interactions become water soaked and the bacteria multiply in the xylem and spread rapidly through the rice leaf.\n\nSince accumulation of PO-C1 activity is correlated with resistance in rice to X. oryzae pv oryzae infection, the isoenzyme may have a role in restricting bacterial multiplication and subsequent spread in rice plants (Reimers et al., 1992). The spatial distribution of PO-Cl in tissues undergoing the HR, however, has not yet been demonstrated. X. oyzae pv oryzae is a vascular pathogen and enters the plant through either hydathode water pores or wounds (Tabei, 1967(Tabei, , 1977)). Upon entering a water pore, bacteria multiply in the spaces surrounding the epithem. This tissue includes modified and loosely organized mesophyll cells beneath the water pore and would thereby allow bacteria to gain access to the xylem. Thus, if PO-Cl plays a role in resistance, the isoenzyme would be expected to accumulate in the xylem vessels. Peroxidases have been found in xylem sap collected from stem exudates and guttation fluids of healthy Helianthus, strawberry, tomato, cucumber, pear, and apple (Biles and Abeles, 1991;Magwa et al., 1993). Recently, Smith et al. (1994) reported that after wounding of French bean hypocotyl tissue, a cationic peroxidase accumulated in the xylem at sites of secondary thickening and in the middle lamella. In the present study, we use immunogold labeling to establish the location of the induced cationic peroxidase PO-C1 in rice leaves after infection by X. oryzae pv oryzae.\n\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs Cas209 and IR-BBIO contain the Xa-20 gene for bacterial blight resistance. IR24 is near isogenic to IR-BBIO but lacks the Xa-20 gene and is susceptible to a11 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae used in this study. Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber as described previously (Reimers and Leach, 1991).\n\nStrains PX086 and PX099A(pBUavrXa10.F1) of X. oryzae pv oryzae carry the avrXalO gene and, when inoculated on rice cultivars containing the corresponding Xu-20 resistance gene, elicit a resistance response (dark brown lesion). PX099A, which lacks the avrXu2O gene, produces a susceptible response (water soaking) when inoculated onto rice cvs IR-BB10 and IR24. X . oryzae pv oryzae strains were maintained at 28°C on WF-P medium (Karganilla et al., 1973). For plant inoculations, X. oryzae pv aryzae cultures were grown in Nutrient Broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 28OC. When required, media were supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations (pg/mL): carbenicillin (100) and kanamycin (100). Inoculum (5 x i09 colony-forming units/mL) was prepared and infiltrated into multiple sites on the second leaf of rice plants as described (Reimers and Leach, 1991;Reimers et al., 1992). For guttation studies, inoculum was infiltrated at a single site two-thirds the length of the leaf from the tip.\n\nInoculated rice leaves (100 g) were harvested 48 h after infection and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen leaves were ground in a coffee grinder, then homogenized with a blender (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) in four volumes of buffer containing 20 mM Mes (pH 6.01, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 0.5 pg/L leupeptin at 4°C. The homogenate was filtered through six to nine layers of sterile cheesecloth and centrifuged at 15,0008 for 10 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 55 to 70% saturation, and the precipitate was dissolved in distilled water with 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.5 pg/mL of leupeptin. The sample was desalted by passage through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) and concentrated in a Centricon-10 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA).\n\nThe concentrated protein was subjected to PAGE in a 0.15 X 10.0 X 5.5 cm resolving gel (nondenaluring cathodic) (Thomas and Hodes, 1981). One lane was removed and stained with 18 mM guaiacol (Maehly, 1954), 0.01% 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, and 0.03% H,O, in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) buffer (Reimers et al., 1992). The gel portion corresponding to PO-Cl was excised and cut into 7 X 1 O mm pieces. Proteins were denatured, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12% PAGE), and were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using Towbin buffer (Towbin et al., 1979), and stained with 0.025% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 in a 40% methanol and 5% acetic acid solution.\n\nPurified PO-C1 samples for sequencing we -e excised from native gels and denatured. To keep Met residues in the peroxidase protein in a reduced state during jeparation in SDS gels, thioglycolic acid was added to tbe cathode buffer (final concentration 0.1 p ~) .\n\nAfter prerL nning the gel for 20 min at 50 V to allow the thioglycolic acid to penetrate the gel, native gel pieces containing denatured PO-C1 were placed in sample wells. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Promega) and stained with Coomassie bri lliant blue. The portions of the membrane containing the PO-Cl (42 kD) were excised and the protein was cleaved u ith cyanogen bromide (10 mg/mL) in 70% formic acid m d eluted from the membrane with a solution of 70% isopropanol, 0.2% (v/v) TFA, 0.1 mM Lys, and 0.1 mM thioglycolic acid. The peptides were concentrated by drying under vacuum and separated by SDS-PAGE in a 16.5% separating gel, a 10% spacer gel, and a 4% stacking gel (Promega, 1991). Thioglycolic acid was added to the cathode buffer (0.2 mM). Dried peptides were denatured at 95°C for 5 min in loading buffer. After separation, PO-C1 peptides were transferred to a ProBlott membrane (Promega). The membrane was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 in a 30% meth-ano1 and 5% acetic acid solution. Stained peptidc. bands (10 total) were excised. Four of the peptides were submitted to R. Cook at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) for sequence analysis by Edman degradation.\n\nThe amino acid sequence MNLAMNLAPLD, ldesignated as POCla, was synthesized by a manual solid-phase method as described (Takemoto et al., 1985;H(?nry et al., 1992). After completion of synthesis, the peptille was removed from the solid phase with anhydrous hydrogen sulfide at the Biotechnology Core Facility of Bicchemistry, Kansas State University (Manhattan). Concentration of the cleaved peptide was estimated by A,,,. by the manufacturers. Anti-PLD antibodies were obtained from Xuemin Wang, Kansas State University (Wang et al., 1993). The antibodies were raised to purified PLD from castor bean, but they also react with rice PLD (S.A. Young, J.E. Leach, and X. Wang, unpublished data).\n\nTo prepare domain-specific antibodies for POCla, approximately 2 mg of synthetic peptide was coupled to 3 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde (Reichlin, 1980). The peptide-hemocyanin conjugate was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1) and injected subcutaneously into female white New Zealand rabbits. Boosters were administered subcutaneously with 125 /ig of peptide-hemocyanin conjugate in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1:1). Antibodies specific to POCla peptide were purified either by affinity chromatography using Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) or by eluting antibodies from nitrocellulose blots according to Smith and Fisher (1984). The antibodies were used at a dilution of up to 1:1000 relative to the original antiserum.\n\nFor competitive binding studies, anti-POCla and anti-PLD antibodies were cleaved with pepsin to isolate F(ab) 2 fragments as described by Harlow and Lane (1988). The F(ab) 2 fragments were purified from the Fc fragment by protein A column chromatography (Sigma) and the saturation titration point was determined by immunoblots.\n\nExtracellular peroxidases were extracted from rice leaves at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation as described (Reimers et al., 1992). Guttation fluids were collected from rice leaves at 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation; samples were obtained 1 h before the start of the photoperiod. PO-C1 activity was measured by using nondenaturing cathodic PAGE (Thomas and Hodes, 1981) and nondenaturing anodic PAGE (Davis, 1964). Electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 30 mA for 3 h in a minigel. Peroxidase was detected by incubating the gel in 100 mM sodium phosphate containing 18 mM guaiacol, 0.01% 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, and 0.03% H 2 O 2 for 15 min (Reimers et al., 1992).\n\nFor immunodetection, proteins were either transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Towbin et al., 1979) after separation on native gels or directly blotted onto nitrocellulose by the use of a slot blot. The nitrocellulose blots were probed with either anti-POCla antibodies or anti-horseradish antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies.\n\nTissue samples were prepared for EM as described previously (Young et al., 1994). Anti-POCla, anti-PLD, and anti-HRP antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:50 for all labeling experiments as described (Lutkenhaus and Bi, 1991). Control reactions were treated with antibodies from preimmune serum at a dilution of 1:50. In competitive binding studies, grids containing sections were treated as described (Lutkenhaus and Bi, 1991), except that the grids were incubated first with either anti-POCla or anti-PLD F(ab) 2 fragments diluted 1:50 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% BSA (TBS buffer). Grids were then treated with anti-POCla antibodies diluted 1:50 in TBS buffer, and finally in Protein A labeled with 10-nm colloidal gold particles (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in TBS buffer.\n\nThin sections of infected leaf tissue were analyzed at a magnification of 30,000 X. For each treatment with antibodies, two grids, two sections/grid, two fields/section, and 5 cm 2 or 5 cm per organelle per field were examined for gold particles. Each treatment consisted of two to four replicates. The gold particles in and around the different plant organelles were counted on prints with the aid of a 1-cm 2 grid. Values are reported as mean numbers ± SE. For binding studies, LSD values were calculated to compare between antibody treatments within tissue type and also between tissue types within a given antibody treatment. The experiment was a split-plot design.\n\nThe cationic peroxidase PO-C1 (pi 8.6) was purified from rice leaves 48 h after inoculation with X. oryzae pv oryzae PXO86. After (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 fractionation, desalination, and concentration by filtration, the proteins were fractionated by a nondenaturing cathodic PAGE. The band corresponding to PO-C1 was excised, and protein in the gel fragment was denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. A single protein of 42 kD was detected by Coomassie brilliant blue stain (Fig. 1).\n\nThe N terminus of PO-C1 was blocked and could not be sequenced. Three of 10 fragments obtained after chemical cleavage of PO-C1 were subjected to sequence analysis by Edman degradation (Fig. 2). Alignments of the N-terminal sequences from the three PO-C1 fragments revealed simi- Rice (ZOO) MVALSGAHTIGQAQcSTFRSRtYt Rica (Pas) ...............QN..D.I.N Barley ...................A.I.G Wheat ...............G..KD.I.N Arabidopsis L........r.KK..RTIMD.L.N Horseradish L.....G..F.R...QF..P.L.N B POC1 Rice (Zoo) Rice (Pss) Barley Wheat Arabidopsis Horseradish Rice (Zoo) Rice (Pss) Barley Wheat Arabidopsis Horseradish S....V..T.PN...N...SNL.

Alignment of amino acid sequences from fragments 1, 2, and 3 of PO-C1 to deduced amino acid sequences of other plant peroxidases.\n\nIndividual peptides, cleaved from PO-C1 by cyanogen bromide, were sequenced and aligned with deduced sequences of peroxidases from rice (Reimmann et al., 1992), barley (Thordal-Christensen et al., 1992), wheat (Dudler et al., 1991), Arabidopsis (Intapruk et al., 1991), and horseradish (Fujiyama et al., 1990).

Fragments 1 and 3 from PO-C1 are more similar to the amino acid sequences of other plant peroxidases than fragment 2. The percentages of identical amino acids in fragment 1 to these peroxidases are: rice, 79%; barley, 88%; wheat, 79%; Arabidopsis, 54%; and horseradish, 63%. In fragment 2 the percentages are: rice, 61%; barley, 52%; wheat, 52%; Arabidopsis, 30%; and horseradish, 39%. In fragment 3 the percentages are: rice, 80%; barley, 87%; wheat, 87%; Arabidopsis, 69%; and horseradish, 50% (Fig. 2).\n\nTo aid in specific detection of PO-C1 in plant tissues or exudates, polyclonal antibodies were generated to a synthetic peptide (POCla = MNLAMNLAPLD; see Fig. 2). The sequence of POCla included an area of fragment 2 that was most diverged from other plant peroxidases (MN-LAPLD). The sequence of the most diverged area, MNLA, was repeated in the peptide to enhance production of antibodies directed to that domain. Antibodies generated against POCla specifically recognized PO-C1 (Fig. 3B, lane 2) in western blot analyses of extracellular fluids from rice plants undergoing an incompatible response 24 h after infection with X. oryzae pv oryzae PXO99 A (pBUavrXalO.Fl). The anti-POCla antibodies did not react with proteins in PO-C5 Figure 3. Anti-POC1a antibodies are specific for PO-C1. Peroxidase activity (A) and western blot analysis (B) of PO-C1 from extracellular extracts from leaves of IR-BB10 infiltrated with X. oryzae pv oryzae PXO99 A (compatible) (lanes 1) and PXO99 A (pBUavrXa10.F1) (incompatible) (lanes 2) 24 h after infiltration. Extracellular fluids were extracted as described by Reimers et al. (1992). Proteins (1.5 /xg/well) were separated in a nondenaturing cathodic polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Anti-POCla antibodies that were bound to PO-C1 were detected by reaction with anti-rabbit IgG-linked alkaline phosphatase.\n\nextracellular fluids collected after 24 h from plants undergoing a compatible interaction (inoculated with the isogenic strain PXO99 A ; Fig. 3B, lane 1). Extracellular fluids contain at least two cationic peroxidases that migrate faster than PO-C1 in cathodic gels (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) and at least seven anionic peroxidases (activity gels and blots not shown; Reimers et al., 1992); the anti-POCla antibodies did not react with these peroxidases, indicating specificity to PO-C1.\n\nIn immunoblots, anti-POCla antibodies detected PO-C1 in extracellular fluids collected from plants undergoing an incompatible response as early as 12 h and the intensity of the reaction increased up to 72 h after infection (Fig. 4). Symptoms of the HR (browning of the infiltration site) were first visible 24 h after infiltration. In the compatible interactions, the anti-POCla antibodies did not react with extracellular fluids until 48 h after infection.

Guttation fluids collected from the hydathodes of infiltrated rice leaves showed a similar pattern of detection of PO-C1. In the incompatible interactions, anti-POCla antibodies reacted to guttation fluids collected 24,48, and 72 h after infection, but did not react with fluids from tissues undergoing compatible responses until 48 h after infection (Fig. 4).\n\nThe antibodies against POCla were used to locate PO-C1 3,12, and 24 h after infection of rice by X. oryzae pv oryzae.\n\nTransmission electron micrographs at 24 h post-infection showed both bacterial accumulation within a xylem vessel (Fig. 5A) and the accumulation of PO-Cl (Fig. 5, B-E). More PO-Cl was detected 24 h after infection in incompatible interactions (Fig. 5, C and E) than in compatible hostl pathogen interactions (Fig. 5, B and D).\n\nThe immunogold labeling of PO-C1 was quantified after EM of samples obtained 3,12, and 24 h post-infection (Fig. 6). Labeling in the compatible interactions at 3, 12, and 24 h was relatively low in the chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular spaces, and membranes of mesophyll cells. More label was observed in the cell walls of mesophyll cells than in the other organelles during the compatible interaction (approximately 3.5 gold particles/cm). However, the number of particles did not vary significantly from 3 to 24 h after infection. An increase in the number of particles was observed in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells within 12 h after infection in the incompatible interactions (Fig. 6B), but the number of particles in the chloroplasts and membranes did not increase. In the incompatible interactions, labeled particles were more abundant 24 h after infection in the apoplast than after 3 and 12 h (Fig. 6, A and B).\n\nThe number of particles in the xylem cell walls (primary and secondary walls) observed was the same (an average of 3.2 gold particles/cm2) at a11 sampling times (3, 12, and 24 h after infection) during compatible interactions (Figs. 58 and 6C). However, a dramatic increase in the number of particles in xylem walls was observed in the incompatible interactions 24 h after infection (12 t 1.1 gold partides/ cm2). Little to no label was detected in the vessel lumen during compatible interactions. However, after 24 h in the incompatible interaction, a large number of particles were observed in the vessel lumen. Particles were observed in the cytoplasm of parenchyma cells adjacent to the xylem in tissues undergoing incompatible responses (data not shown).\n\nWhen tissues were first treated with F(ab), fragments from anti-POCla antibodies, binding of anti-POCla antibodies to PO-Cl was blocked and little label was observed in tissues during both incompatible and compatible interactions 24 h after infection (Table I; Fig. 5, F and G). Anti-PLD F(ab), fragments did not block the antigenic sites of PO-Cl and binding of anti-POCla antibody to PO-Cl was detected (Table I). These experiments indicate that the binding of anti-POCla antibodies observed in the tissue sections is specific to PO-C1 (Fig. 5, F and G).\n\nAnti-HRP antibodies were shown to cross-react to many rice peroxidases, including PO-Cl (Reimers et al., 1992). When anti-HRP antibodies were used to label incompatible rice leaf tissue, particles were detected throughout the leaf tissue, including the cytoplasm, chloroplast, and extracellular spaces (Fig. 7B). Three-fold more gold particles were bound after detection with anti-HRP antibodies than with antibodies specific to PO-C1 . Even peroxidases located within the bacteria were detected. Particles were not observed in resin surrounding the leaf tissue. Antibodies to a cytoplasmic enzyme PLD were associated primarily with the membrane and cytoplasm; little labeling occurred within the chloroplast and no labeling was detected in the apoplast or xylem lumen (Fig. 7A). Thus, gold labeling by anti-POCla antibody was dependent on the presence of PO-Cl and was not affected by the general inability of labeled antibody to react with antigens in various cellular organelles.\n\nIn this study, we present evidence that the cationic peroxidase, PO-Cl, accumulates in the apoplast of mesophyll tissue and xylem vessels of rice during resistant interactions with X. oryzae pv oryzae. Although peroxidases have been found to be associated with secondary thickenings and the middle lamella of xylem tissues from differentiating and wounded bean hypocotyl (Smith et al., 1994) and xylem sap and guttation fluids from a number of healthy plants (Biles and Abeles, 1991;Magwa et al., 1993), high accumulation of PO-C1 was dependent on infection. PO-Cl accumulated faster and to higher levels in resistant than in susceptible host/pathogen interactions. Cationic peroxidases other than PO-Cl were detected in water-treated rice plants, but the levels of these did not change.\n\nPurification of the isoenzyme allowed us to obtain and compare amino acid sequences of three interna1 PO-Cl fragments with other plant peroxidases. PO-Cl sequences were highly similar to a11 plant peroxidases examined. Sequence identity between PO-C1 and monocot peroxidases was greater than with dicot peroxidases. The amino acid sequence of PO-Cl differs from that of the pathogeninduced peroxidase recently identified from a rice cDNA library using a wheat peroxidase clone as a probe (Fig. 2; Reimmann et al., 1992), suggesting that these two pathogen-induced peroxidases are different isoenzymes.\n\nThe domain-specific immunological probe, which recognizes the cationic peroxidase PO-C1, is specific for PO-Cl. The antibodies did not react with other peroxidases, including the induced anionic peroxidases (PO-A1 and PO-A2; Reimers et al., 1992), in western blot analyses. Furthermore, anti-POCla F(ab), fragments inhibited the binding of anti-POCla antibodies, but not anti-PLD antibodies.\n\nAnti-POCla antibodies were used to determine the location of PO-Cl during compatible and incompatible interactions in tissues after infection with X . oryzae pv oryzae. Two lines of evidence establish that PO-Cl is located in the xylem vessels. First, PO-C1 accumulates in incompatible interactions in guttation fluids within 24 h after infection. PO-Cl was not detected in guttation fluids from plants Plant Physiol. Vol. 107, 1995 Figure 5.

Second, antibodies specific for PO-C1 immuno-decorated the cell walls and lumen of xylem vessels within 24 h after infection during an incompatible response. More PO-Cl was detected in the cell walls of the xylem than in the lumen. PO-Cl also was detected in the cytoplasm of parenchyma cells adjacent to the xylem vessels. These data suggest that the isoenzyme is expressed in neighboring cells and can be distributed into the enucleated xylem vessels. PO-C1 also was found in the apoplast of mesophyll cells. Again, more PO-Cl was detected in the cell walls than in the extracellular spaces.\n\nThe accumulation of PO-Cl during the incompatible response, which occurred within the xylem vessels and the apoplast of mesophyll cells in tissues where the bacteria were found, suggests that this isoenzyme may be involved in the defense response of rice. Secretion of pathogenesisinduced peroxidases into intercellular spaces is thought to be involved in controlling the invasion of different pathogens (Nicholson and Hammerschmidt, 1992). However, the role of PO-Cl in the defense response is not clear. PO-Cl might be a lignin peroxidase. The timing of the accumulation of PO-Cl activity correlates with lignin deposition, and the isoenzyme has been shown to utilize the lignin precursor coniferyl alcohol as a substrate in vitro (Reimers and Leach, 1991). PO-Cl has not been shown to be involved in lignin synthesis in vivo. Lignin and other phenolic polymers can serve as physical barriers and, therefore, are thought to retard funga1 penetration of host cells (Ride, 1983;Tiburzy and Reisener, 1990). However, bacterial plant pathogens such as X. oryzae pv oryzae do not penetrate host cells. Consequently, cell wall lignification probably would\n\nLumen 5.9 -C 0.5 0.5 ? 0.2 5.7 2 0.4 Wall 11.9 t 0.6 1.1 2 0.6 12.1 2 0.7 LSD,,,, = 1.6' LSD, , , = 1 .3d a Mean number of gold particles on the wall and membrane of mesophyll cells was counted per cm.

The lignin biosynthetic process itself could also be an important component of the defense response against bacteria, because bacteria may be inhibited by toxic phenolic compounds (Venere, 1980;Horino and Kaku, 1989), phenolic free radicals, or activated oxygen (Elstner, 1982), all of which are associated with lignification. Thus, the role of PO-C1 in resistance might be a consequence of its function in lignin biosynthesis. Further studies on the molecular characterization of the PO-C1 gene may provide valuable insights into any possible direct role of this cationic peroxidase in the defense response.\n\nPartially purified PO-C1 was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. www.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from Copyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.
