Florida Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Purpose of Report\n\nThis report presents the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for fecal coliform bacteria for Crane Creek in the Indian River Lagoon Basin. The creek was verified as impaired for fecal coliform and therefore was included on the Verified List of impaired waters for the Indian River Lagoon Basin that was adopted by Secretarial Order on December 12, 2007. The TMDL establishes the allowable fecal coliform loadings to Crane Creek that would restore the waterbody so that it meets its applicable water quality criterion for fecal coliform.\n\nCrane Creek is located in the southeast part of Brevard County. It flows primarily in an easterly direction into the Indian River Lagoon and drains an area of about 18.2 square miles. The Crane Creek watershed is located in the central part of the city of Melbourne, where the majority of land use is highly urbanized. The creek receives water through canal ditches from the urban area. It is divided into two WBIDs, which include a predominantly freshwater segment (WBID 3085) and a predominantly marine segment (WBID 3085A) (Figure 1.1). These two parts are connected to each other, and fresh water flows in an easterly direction into the estuary.\n\nFor assessment purposes, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (Department) has divided the Indian River Lagoon Basin into water assessment polygons with a unique waterbody identification (WBID) number for each watershed or stream reach. This TMDL addresses the following WBIDs:\n\nWBID 3085, Crane Creek (Fresh Water) -for fecal coliform, and WBID 3085A, Crane Creek (Marine) -for fecal coliform.\n\nThis report was developed as part of the Department's watershed management approach for restoring and protecting state waters and addressing TMDL Program requirements. The watershed approach, which is implemented using a cyclical management process that rotates through the state's 52 river basins over a 5-year cycle, provides a framework for implementing the TMDL Program-related requirements of the 1972 federal Clean Water Act and the 1999 Florida Watershed Restoration Act (FWRA) (Chapter 99-223, Laws of Florida).\n\nA TMDL represents the maximum amount of a given pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate and still meet water quality standards, including its applicable water quality criteria and its designated uses. TMDLs are developed for waterbodies that are verified as not meeting their water quality standards. They provide important water quality restoration goals that will guide restoration activities. Florida Department of Environmental Protection 2 Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\nChapter 2: DESCRIPTION OF WATER QUALITY PROBLEM 2.1 Statutory Requirements and Rulemaking History Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act requires states to submit to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists of surface waters that do not meet applicable water quality standards (impaired waters) and establish a TMDL for each pollutant causing the impairment of listed waters on a schedule. The Department has developed such lists, commonly referred to as 303(d) lists, since 1992. The list of impaired waters in each basin, referred to as the Verified List, is also required by the FWRA (Subsection 403.067[4], Florida Statutes [F.S.]); the state's 303(d) list is amended annually to include basin updates. Florida's 1998 303(d) list included 26 waterbodies in the Indian River Lagoon Basin. However, the FWRA (Section 403.067, F.S.) stated that all previous Florida 303(d) lists were for planning purposes only and directed the Department to develop, and adopt by rule, a new science-based methodology to identify impaired waters. After a long rulemaking process, the Environmental Regulation Commission adopted the new methodology as Rule 62-303, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (Identification of Impaired Surface Waters Rule, or IWR), in April 2001; the rule was modified in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe Department used the IWR to assess water quality impairments in the Crane Creek watershed and has verified that these waterbody segments are impaired for fecal coliform bacteria. For the freshwater segment of the creek (WBID 3085), the verification of impairment was based on the observations that 49 out of 81 fecal coliform samples collected during the verified period (January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2006) exceeded the applicable fecal water quality criterion (Rule 62-302, F.A.C.). For the marine segment of the creek (WBID 3085A), the verification of impairment was based on the observation that 17 out of 32 fecal coliform samples collected during the verified period exceeded the applicable fecal water quality criterion.\n\nTable 2.1 summarizes the fecal coliform monitoring results for the verified period for each WBID.\n\nTable 2.1.

Florida Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 3. DESCRIPTION OF APPLICABLE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND TARGETS 3.1 Classification of the Waterbody and Criterion Applicable to the TMDL Florida's surface waters are protected for five designated use classifications, as follows: Class I Potable water supplies Class II Shellfish propagation or harvesting Class III Recreation, propagation, and maintenance of a healthy, wellbalanced population of fish and wildlife Class IV Agricultural water supplies Class V Navigation, utility, and industrial use (there are no state waters currently in this class) Crane Creek is Class III waterbody, with a designated use of recreation, propagation, and maintenance of a healthy, well-balanced population of fish and wildlife. The criterion applicable to this TMDL is the Class III criterion for fecal coliform. 3.2 Applicable Water Quality Standards and Numeric Water Quality Target Numeric criteria for bacterial quality are expressed in terms of fecal coliform bacteria concentration. The water quality criterion for the protection of Class III waters, as established by Rule 62-302, F.A.C., states the following:\n\nThe most probable number (MPN) or membrane filter (MF) counts per 100 mL of fecal coliform bacteria shall not exceed a monthly average of 200, nor exceed 400 in 10 percent of the samples, nor exceed 800 on any one day.\n\nThe criterion states that monthly averages shall be expressed as geometric means based on a minimum of 10 samples taken over a 30-day period. During the development of load duration curves for the impaired segments (as described in subsequent chapters), there were insufficient data (fewer than 10 samples in a given month) available to evaluate the geometric mean criterion for fecal coliform bacteria. Therefore, the criterion selected for the TMDLs was not to exceed 400 MPN/100 mL in any sampling event for fecal coliform. The 10 percent exceedance allowed by the water quality criterion for fecal coliform bacteria was not used directly in estimating the target load, but was included in the TMDL margin of safety (as described in subsequent chapters).\n\nChapter 4: ASSESSMENT OF SOURCES\n\nAn important part of the TMDL analysis is the identification of pollutant source categories, source subcategories, or individual sources of pollutants in the impaired waterbody and the amount of pollutant loadings contributed by each of these sources. Sources are broadly classified as either \"point sources\" or \"nonpoint sources.\" Historically, the term point sources has meant discharges to surface waters that typically have a continuous flow via a discernable, confined, and discrete conveyance, such as a pipe. Domestic and industrial wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) are examples of traditional point sources. In contrast, the term \"nonpoint sources\" was used to describe intermittent, rainfall-driven, diffuse sources of pollution associated with everyday human activities, including runoff from urban land uses, agriculture, silviculture, and mining; discharges from failing septic systems; and atmospheric deposition.\n\nHowever, the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act redefined certain nonpoint sources of pollution as point sources subject to regulation under the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination (NPDES) Program. These nonpoint sources included certain urban stormwater discharges, including those from local government master drainage systems, construction sites over five acres, and a wide variety of industries (see Appendix A for background information on the federal and state stormwater programs).\n\nTo be consistent with Clean Water Act definitions, the term \"point source\" will be used to describe traditional point sources (such as domestic and industrial wastewater discharges) and stormwater systems requiring an NPDES stormwater permit when allocating pollutant load reductions required by a TMDL (see Section 6.1). However, the methodologies used to estimate nonpoint source loads do not distinguish between NPDES stormwater discharges and non-NPDES stormwater discharges, and as such, this source assessment section does not make any distinction between the two types of stormwater.\n\nOne NPDES-permitted wastewater facility (Melbourne/Grant Street WWTP, FL0041122) was identified in the Crane Creek watershed. This domestic WWTP is currently permitted under a NPDES wastewater permit. The surface water discharge from the facility is limited to a maximum of 5 days during the mechanical integrity testing of the facility's underground injection well. The discharge is authorized only during the winter months (November through March).\n\nNo maximum value is designated in the permit for the discharge rate. For the period from 1999 through 2006, the facility only discharged twice, in March 1999 and March 2004. The discharge Florida Department of Environmental Protection rates were 3.74 million gallons per day (mgd) and 3.7 mgd, and the fecal coliform concentrations were 11 counts/100mL and below the detection limit in 1999 and 2004, respectively. The total fecal coliform load from the facility in March 1999 was 1.56 x 10 9 counts/day.\n\nAccording to the permit issued to the facility, any one sample shall not exceed 86 fecal coliform counts/100mL. There is an underground injection well system that is limited to 11.5 mgd AADF (Annual Average Daily Flow), which is the permitted combined treatment capacity of the Melbourne D.B Lee WWTF and Melbourne Grant Street WWTF. There is also an existing slowrate public access land application system. The existing reuse capacity is 0.5 mgd AADF, with a total anticipated reuse capacity of 1.0 mgd AADF.\n\nThe stormwater collection systems owned and operated by the city of Melbourne in the Crane Creek watershed are covered by a Phase II NPDES municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permit (FLR04E027). The city of Melbourne is the lead permittee for the permit. There was no Phase I MS4 permit identified in the Crane Creek watershed.\n\nThe spatial distribution and acreage of different land use categories were identified using the SJRWMD's year 2004 land use coverage (scale 1:40,000) contained in the Department's geographic information system (GIS) library. Land use categories in the watershed were aggregated using the simplified Level 1 codes and tabulated in Table 4.1. Figure 4.1 shows the acreage of the principal land uses in the watershed.\n\nTable 4.1, the Crane Creek watershed drains about 11,642 acres of land. The dominant land use category is urban (urban and built-up; low-, medium-, and high-density residential; and transportation, communication, and utilities), which accounts for about 67 percent of the total watershed area. Of the 7,792 acres of urban lands, residential land use occupies about 4,133 acres, or about 35.5 percent of the total watershed area. Natural land use areas, which include water/wetlands, upland forest, and barren land, occupy about 2,379 acres, accounting for about 20.4 percent of the total watershed area.\n\nBecause no significant conventional point source contributor was identified in the Crane Creek watershed, the primary loadings of fecal coliform into these canals are generated by nonpoint sources or MS4-permitted areas in the watershed. Nonpoint sources of coliform bacteria generally, but not always, come from the coliform bacteria that accumulate on land surfaces and wash off as a result of storm events, the contribution from ground water from sources such as failed septic tanks, and the improper land application of domestic wastewater residuals. Typical nonpoint sources of coliform bacteria include the following:\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection • Wildlife,\n\n• Agricultural animals,\n\n• Pets in residential areas,\n\n• Onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (septic tanks),\n\n• Land application of domestic wastewater residuals, and\n\nNo data were available to specifically identify and quantify the major source(s) of fecal coliform bacteria in the Crane Creek watershed. However, the spatial distribution of fecal coliform across Crane Creek and the timing of high fecal coliform readings in the downstream segment of the creek shed some light on the possible sources of these bacteria. In fact, the land use types in the watershed, especially land use around stations from which water quality samples were collected, provide further information on the potentially important sources for the fecal coliform pollution in the watershed. Florida Department of Environmental Protection Concentrations of fecal coliform in May 2006 were especially high. Most of the data points collected in this sampling event were higher than 10,000 MPN/100 mL (Figure 4.3). The Department continues to collect more samples to confirm if these data are representative of the fecal coliform concentration in the downstream section. 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 J A J O J A J O J A J O J A J O J A J O J A J O J A 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 month fecal coliform concentation (counts/100mL) Florida Department of Environmental Protection Florida Department of Environmental Protection 12 1 10 100 1000 100000 10000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 2005 2006 Month fecal coliform concentration (counts/100 mL) 21FLCEN 27010076 21FLCEN 27010077 21FLCEN 27010078 21FLCEN 27010079 21FLCEN 27010588 21FLBRA 3085-A 21FLBRA 3085-B 21FLBRA 3085-C 21FLBRA 3085-D\n\nPets (especially dogs) could be a significant source of coliform pollution through surface runoff in the Crane Creek watershed. Studies report that up to 95 percent of the fecal coliform found in urban stormwater can have nonhuman origins (Alderiso et al., 1996;Trial et al., 1993).\n\nThe most important nonhuman fecal coliform contributors appear to be dogs and cats. In a highly urbanized Baltimore catchment, Lim and Olivieri (1982) found that dog feces were the single greatest source for fecal coliform and fecal strep bacteria. Trial et al. (1993) also reported that cats and dogs were the primary source of fecal coliform in urban subwatersheds.\n\nUsing bacteria source tracking techniques, it was found in Stevenson Creek in Clearwater, Florida, that the amount of fecal coliform bacteria contributed by dogs was as important as those from septic tanks (Watson, 2002).\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association (APPMA), about 4 out of 10 U.S. households include at least one dog. A single gram of dog feces contains about 23 million fecal coliform bacteria (van der Wel, 1995). Unfortunately, statistics show that about 40 percent of American dog owners do not pick up their dogs' feces. Table 4.2 shows the fecal coliform concentrations of the surface runoff measured in two urban areas (Bannerman et al., 1993;Steuer et al., 1997). While the bacteria levels differed widely in the two studies, both indicated that residential lawns, driveways, and streets were the major source areas for bacteria.\n\nTable 4.2. Concentrations (Geometric Mean Colonies per 100 mL) of Fecal Coliform from Urban Source Areas (Steuer et al., 1997; Bannerman et al., 1993) Geographic Location Marquette, MI Madison, WI Number of storms sampled 12 9 Commercial parking lot 4,200 1,758 High-traffic street 1,900 9,627 Medium-traffic street 2,400 56,554 Low-traffic street 280 92,061 Commercial rooftop 30 1,117 Residential rooftop 2,200 294 Residential driveway 1,900 34,294 Residential lawns 4,700 42,093 Basin outlet 10,200 175,106\n\nThe number of dogs in the Crane Creek watershed is not known. Therefore, the statistics produced by APPMA were used in this analysis to estimate the possible fecal coliform loads contributed by dogs. The total human population in the Crane Creek watershed, calculated based on the Tiger Track 2000 data (Department's GIS library) was 26,047. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there was an average of 2.35 people per household in Brevard County in 2000. This gives about 11,084 households in the entire watershed. Assuming that 40 percent of the households in this area have one dog, the total number of dogs in the watershed is about 4,434.\n\nAccording to the waste production rate for dogs and the fecal coliform counts per gram of dog wastes listed in Table 4.3, and assuming that 40 percent of dog owners do not pick up dog feces, the total waste produced by dogs and left on the land surface in residential areas would be 798,300 grams/day. The total produced by dogs would be 1.76 x 10 12 counts/day of fecal coliform. It should be noted that this load only represents the fecal coliform load created in the watershed and is not intended to be used to represent a part of the existing load that reaches the receiving waterbody. The fecal coliform load that eventually reaches the receiving waterbody could be significantly less than this value due to attenuation in overland transport.\n\nSeptic tanks are another potentially important source of coliform pollution in urban watersheds. When properly installed, most of the coliform from septic tanks should be removed within 50 meters of the drainage field (Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, 1999). However, in areas with a relatively high ground water table, the drainfield can be flooded during the rainy season, and coliform bacteria can pollute the surface water through stormwater runoff.\n\nSeptic tanks may also cause coliform pollution when they are built too close to irrigation wells. Any well that is installed in the surficial aquifer system will cause a drawdown. If the septic tank system is built too close to the well (e.g., less than 75 feet), the septic tank discharge will be within the cone of influence of the well. As a result, septic tank effluent may enter the well, and once the polluted water is used to irrigate lawns, coliform bacteria may reach the land surface and wash into surface waters during the rainy season.\n\nA rough estimate of fecal coliform loads from failed septic tanks in the Crane Creek watershed can be made using Equation 4.1:\n\nWhere, L is the fecal coliform daily load (counts/day), N is the total number of septic tanks in the area (septic tanks), Q is the discharge rate for each septic tank, C is the fecal coliform concentration for the septic tank discharge, and F is the septic tank failure rate.\n\nBased on 2007 Florida Department of Health (FDOH) onsite sewage GIS coverage (http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/programs/EhGis/EhGisDownload.htm), about 212 housing units (N) were identified as being on septic tanks in the Crane Creek watershed (Figure 4.4). The discharge rate from each septic tank (Q) was calculated by multiplying the average household size by the per capita wastewater production rate per day. Based on the information published by the Census Bureau, the average household size for Brevard County is about 2.35 people/household. The same population density was assumed for the Crane Creek watershed. A commonly cited value for per capita wastewater production rate is 70 gallons/day/person (EPA, 2001). The commonly cited concentration (C) for septic tank discharge is 1x10 6 counts/100mL for fecal coliform (EPA, 2001). Florida Department of Environmental Protection 15 (USEPA, 2001). The commonly cited concentration (C) for septic tank discharge are 1x10 6 counts/100 ml for fecal coliform (USEPA, 2001).\n\nNo measured septic tank failure rate data were available for the watershed at the time this TMDL was developed. Therefore, the failure rate was derived from the number of septic tank and septic tank repair permits for the county published by FDOH (http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/OSTDS/statistics/ostdsstatistics.htm). The number of septic tanks in the county was calculated assuming that none of the installed septic tanks will be removed after being installed (Table 4.4). The reported number of septic tank repair permits was also obtained from the FDOH Website (Table 4.4). Based on this information, a discovery rate of failed septic tanks for each year between 2000 and 2005 was calculated and listed in Table 4.4.\n\nBased on Table 4.4, the average annual septic tank failure discovery rate for Brevard County is about 0.34%. Assuming that failed septic tanks are not discovered for about 5 years, the estimated annual septic tank failure rate is about 5 times the discovery rate, which is equal to 1.7 percent. Based on Equation 4.1, the estimated fecal coliform loading from failed septic tanks in the Crane Creek watershed is about 2.2 x 10 10 counts/day.\n\nTable 4.4. Estimated Septic Tank Numbers and Septic Tank Failure Rates for Brevard County, 2000-05 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Average New installation (septic tanks) 1,455 1,774 142 1,515 1,715 3,039 1,607 Accumulated installation (septic tanks) 77,357 78,812 80,586 80,728 82,243 83,958 80,614 Repair permit (septic tanks) 427 407 131 275 234 183 276 Failure discovery rate (%) 0.55 0.52 0.16 0.34 0.28 0.22 0.34 Failure rate (%)* 2.8 2.6 0.8 1.7 1.4 1.1 1.7 * Failure rate is 5 times the failure discovery rate.\n\nSanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) can also be a potential source of fecal bacteria pollution. Human sewage can be introduced into surface waters even when storm and sanitary sewers are separated. Leaks and overflows are common in many older sanitary sewers where capacity is exceeded, high rates of infiltration and inflow occur (i.e., outside water gets into pipes, reducing capacity), frequent blockages occur, or sewers are simply falling apart due to poor joints or pipe materials. Power failures at pumping stations are also a common cause of SSOs.\n\nThe greatest risk of an SSO occurs during storm events; however, few comprehensive data are available to quantify SSO frequency and bacteria loads in most watersheds.\n\nWhen this TMDL was developed, no information on sewer line coverage was available to the Department, and so it was difficult to determine with certainty whether the entire area was sewered. Typically, the medium-density residential areas are sewered to avoid too-high septic tank density. If the medium-density residential areas shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6 are sewered, as these residential areas are more than 20 years old, sewer line leakage could be a significant source of the fecal pollution.\n\nFecal coliform loading from sewer line leakage can be calculated based on the number of people in the watershed, typical per household generation rates, and typical fecal coliform concentrations in domestic sewage, assuming a leakage rate of 0.5 percent (Culver et al., 2002). Based on this assumption, a rough estimate of fecal coliform loads from leaks and SSOs in the Crane Creek watershed can be made using Equation 4.2.\n\nWhere, L is the fecal coliform daily load (counts/day); N is the number of households using sanitary sewer in the watershed; Q is the discharge rate for each household; C is the fecal coliform concentration for domestic wastewater discharge, and F is the sewer line leakage rate.\n\nThe number of households (N) that are tied to sewer lines is 10,881 (total households minus the households using septic tanks) in the Crane Creek watershed . The discharge rate through sewers from each household (Q) was calculated by multiplying the average household size (2.35) by the per capita wastewater production rate per day (70 gallons). The commonly cited concentration (C) for domestic wastewater is 1x10 6 counts/100mL for fecal coliform (EPA, 2001). The contribution of fecal coliform through sewer line leakage was assumed to be 0.5 percent of the total sewage loading created from the population not on septic tanks (Culver et al., 2002). Based on Equation 4.2, the estimated fecal coliform loading from sewer line leakage in the watershed is about 3.4 x 10 11 counts/day.\n\nWildlife is another possible source of fecal and total coliform bacteria in the Crane Creek watershed. As shown in Figure 4.1, there are wetland areas along Crane Creek, and these are likely habitats for small wildlife such as rabbits and raccoons. For highly urbanized areas, birds and rats could also be important contributors to bacterial pollution. Florida Department of Environmental Protection Water flows from January 1999 to January 2003 at Station 02249500 were then estimated using the gage height-flow correlation equation and the gage heights estimated based on the gage height correlation between the two stations. The gage height and flow measurements from both USGS gaging stations were downloaded from the USGS Florida Integrated Science Center water resources Website (http://fl.water.usgs.gov). The flow duration curve for Crane Creek was developed based on a mixed flow dataset, which includes both measured data when they were available and the estimated data when the measured data were not available.\n\nThe flow duration curve was created by using the percentile function and the flow record to generate the flow at a given duration interval. For example, at the 90 th duration interval, the percentile function calculates the flow that is equal or exceeded 90 percent of the time. y = 0.8684x + 5.5262 R 2 = 0.5741 8 10 12 14 16 18 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 Gage Height (f) at station 2249500 Gage Height (f) at station 2249510 2 Figure 5.3.

This created a mixed dataset that included both the regression predicted flow and measured flow.  0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 100.0 120.0 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Flow duration interval Flow (cfs) Measured Extended Develop the Load Duration Curves for Both the Allowable Load and Existing Loading Capacity Flow duration curves are transformed into load duration curves by multiplying the flow values along the flow duration curve by the fecal coliform concentration and the appropriate conversion factors. The final results of the load are typically expressed as MPN per day. The following equations were used to calculate the allowable loads and the existing loading: Allowable load = (observed flow) x (conversion factor) x (state criteria) (1) Existing loading = (observed flow) x (conversion factor) x (coliform measurement) (2)\n\nOn the load duration curve, allowable and existing loads are plotted against the flow duration ranking. The allowable load was calculated based on the water quality criterion and flow values from the flow duration curve, and the line drawn through the data points representing the allowable load is called the target line. The existing loads are based on the instream fecal coliform concentrations measured during ambient monitoring and an estimate of flow in the stream at the time of sampling.\n\nAs noted previously, because insufficient data were collected to evaluate the fecal coliform monthly geometric mean, 400 MPN/100mL was used as the target criterion for fecal coliform. Figure 5.5 shows both the allowable loads and the existing loads over the flow duration ranking for Crane Creek. The points of the existing load that were higher than the allowable load at a given flow duration ranking were considered an exceedance of the criterion.\n\nAs shown in Figure 5.5, exceedances of the fecal coliform criterion in Crane Creek occurred across the entire span of the flow record. In general, exceedances on the right side of the curve typically occur during low-flow events, implying a contribution from either point sources or baseflow, which could come from the load from failed septic tanks and sewer line leakage that interact with surface water. The exceedances that appear on the left side of the curve usually represent loading from stormwater-related sources. In this case, the potential sources may include contributions from pets such as dogs and cats, wild animals, failed septic tanks, and sewer line leakage.\n\nThe critical condition for coliform loadings in a given watershed depends on many factors, including the presence of point sources and the land use pattern in the watershed. Typically, the critical condition for nonpoint sources is an extended dry period followed by a rainfall runoff event. During the wet weather period, rainfall washes off coliform bacteria that have built up on the land surface under dry conditions, resulting in the wet weather exceedances. However, significant nonpoint source contributions can also appear under dry conditions without any major surface runoff event. This usually happens when nonpoint sources contaminate the surficial aquifer, and fecal coliform bacteria are brought into the receiving waters through baseflow. In addition, wildlife with direct access to the receiving water can contribute to the exceedance during dry weather. The critical condition for point source loading typically occurs during periods of low stream flow, when dilution is minimized.\n\nFor Crane Creek, the exceedance frequency is evenly distributed across the entire span of the flow conditions, and exceedances also occur in the same way. Because exceedances occur throughout the flow record, no critical condition was defined in this TMDL. The Department used the flow records and water quality data available for the 10 th to 90 th percentile flow duration interval for the TMDL analysis. Flow conditions that were exceeded less than 10 percent of the time were not used because they represent abnormally high-flow events, and flow conditions occurring greater than 90 percent of the time were not used because they are extreme low-flow events.\n\nChapter 6: DETERMINATION OF THE TMDL\n\nThe objective of a TMDL is to provide a basis for allocating acceptable loads among all of the known pollutant sources in a watershed so that appropriate control measures can be implemented and water quality standards achieved. A TMDL is expressed as the sum of all point source loads (Wasteload Allocations, or WLAs), nonpoint source loads (Load Allocations, or LAs), and an appropriate margin of safety (MOS), which takes into account any uncertainty concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water quality:\n\nAs discussed earlier, the WLA is broken out into separate subcategories for wastewater discharges and stormwater discharges regulated under the NPDES Program:\n\nIt should be noted that the various components of the revised TMDL equation may not sum up to the value of the TMDL because (a) the WLA for NPDES stormwater is typically based on the percent reduction needed for nonpoint sources and is also accounted for within the LA, and (b) TMDL components can be expressed in different terms (for example, the WLA for stormwater is typically expressed as a percent reduction, and the WLA for wastewater is typically expressed as mass per day).\n\nWLAs for stormwater discharges are typically expressed as \"percent reduction\" because it is very difficult to quantify the loads from MS4s (given the numerous discharge points) and to distinguish loads from MS4s from other nonpoint sources (given the nature of stormwater transport). The permitting of stormwater discharges also differs from the permitting of most wastewater point sources. Because stormwater discharges cannot be centrally collected, monitored, and treated, they are not subject to the same types of effluent limitations as wastewater facilities, and instead are required to meet a performance standard of providing treatment to the \"maximum extent practical\" through the implementation of best management practices (BMPs).\n\nThis approach is consistent with federal regulations (40 CFR § 130.2[I]), which state that TMDLs can be expressed in terms of mass per time (e.g., pounds per day), toxicity, or other appropriate measure. The TMDLs for Crane Creek are expressed in terms of MPN/day and percent reduction, and represent the maximum daily fecal coliform load the stream can assimilate without exceeding the fecal coliform criterion (Table 6.1).\n\nTable 6.1. TMDL Components for Fecal Coliform in the Crane Creek Watershed, WBIDs 3085 and 3085A WLA Parameter TMDL (colonies/day) Wastewater (colonies/day) NPDES Stormwater (% reduction) LA (% reduction) MOS Fecal coliform 1.23E+11 1.21E+10 * 56.3% 56.3 % Implicit * Discharge from the WWTP is only allowed during the maximum five-day mechanical integrity test as defined in the permit.\n\nBased on a loading duration curve approach similar to that developed by Kansas (Stiles, 2002), the load allocation is a 56.3 percent reduction in fecal coliform from nonpoint sources. It should be noted that the LA includes loading from stormwater discharges regulated by the Department and the water management districts that are not part of the NPDES stormwater program (see Appendix A).\n\nOne NPDES-permitted wastewater facility with fecal coliform limits was identified in the Crane Creek watershed: the city of Melbourne Grant Street WWTP (FL0041122). The state already requires all NPDES point source dischargers to meet the bacteria criterion at the end of the pipe. It is the Department's current practice not to allow mixing zones for bacteria.\n\nThese requirements will also be applied to any possible future point sources that may discharge in the watershed to meet end-of-pipe standards for coliform bacteria. Based on the wastewater permit issued to this facility, the facility is only allowed to discharge to surface water for a maximum of 5 days when a mechanical integrity test is conducted. According to the Department's Permit Compliance System database, the facility only discharged twice (March 1999 andMarch 2004) during the verified period. The discharge rates were 3.74 mgd and 3.7 mgd, and the fecal coliform concentrations were 11 counts/100mL and below the detection limit in 1999 and 2004, respectively.\n\nSince the fecal coliform concentration in the discharge did not exceed the limit concentration described in the permit to the facility (86 counts/100mL) and the target concentration for this TMDL (400 counts/100mL), the Department suggests that the facility keep its existing discharge load limitation, which is 1.21 x 10 10 counts/day (assuming 3.72 mgd, which is an average of 2 discharge rates and 86 fecal coliform counts/100mL) for a maximum of 5 days during the mechanical integrity test.\n\nFailure Rates for BrevardCounty, 2000-05................................................................. 16\n\nTMDL Components for Fecal Coliform in the Crane CreekWatershed, WBIDs 3085 and 3085A ..................................................... 30\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection iii\n\nList of Figures\n\n** Number from APPMA."
