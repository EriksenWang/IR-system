    "abstract": "Syntectonic evaporitic levels within foredeep basin play an important role during the last stages of development of fold-and-thrust belts. These evaporites easily transmit tectonic stresses acting as preferred detachment levels. Both within the Spanish Pyrenees as well as within the Polish Carpathians syntectonic evaporites developed in their foredeep basins that controlled final stages of thrusting within the orogenic wedges. Within the SE frontal Pyrenees, thick and laterally extent evaporites of the Cardona and Barbastro formations controlled the position of ramps and backthrusts as well as of triangle zones developed within the Ebro basin. Overlap zones of successive evaporitic levels defined the location of anticlines on the hangingwall of thrust ramps, whereas the external pinch outs of the uppermost evaporitic level define the position of backthrusts. Frontal Polish Carpathian orogenic wedge including a zone of deformed Miocene foredeep sediments (the Zgłobice unit) is also characterized by the presence of Middle Miocene foredeep evaporites, that strongly influenced Miocene stages of the Carpathian thrusting. In the Tarnów area, where foredeep evaporites are thinner and consist mainly of anhydrite, a triangle zone developed within the Zgłobice unit between the north-directed frontal thrust of the flysch (pre-Miocene) Outer Carpathians and the southdirected backthrust related to the Miocene anhydritic layer. The tip point of this triangle zone may have been controlled either by location of a zone of rapid thinning of anhydrites above the northern slope of the pre-Miocene erosional paleovalley, or by an overlap zone of two anhydritic units above this slope. The Zgłobice unit in the Wieliczka area is characterized by a system of north-directed tectonic slices carrying thick rock salt interlayered by siliciclastics. The Wieliczka triangle zone might have formed where lateral changes of evaporitic facies occurred at the transition from thick rock salt to thinner anhydrite facies.",
    "full_text": "It long has been recognized that rock salt, due to its specific bulk properties, is one of the most important components of sedimentary basins and thrust belts. Evaporites in general, and rock salt in particular, are of key importance for evolution of fold-andthrust belts, as evaporitic layers often form preferred levels of detachments within the orogenic wedge (e.g. Davis & Engelder, 1985;Cotton & Koyi, 2000;Costa & Vendeville, 2002;Bahroudi & Koyi, 2003;Costa et al., 2004;Sherkati et al., 2005). The majority of the detached fold-and-thrust belts are displaced above preshortening evaporites (see compilation in Letouzey et al., 1995). However, some fold-and-thrust belts also used syn-compressive evaporitic levels related to deposition within their foredeep basins, as it is the case for the Spanish Pyrenees and the Polish Carpathians that are discussed in this paper.\n\nThe Carpathians and the Pyrenees belong to the same Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt formed by the closure of the Tethys Ocean (Fig. 1). At present, the frontal part of the S Pyrenees is well exposed, whereas the front of the Polish Carpathians is mostly buried, especially in their central segment described below. The fronts of the Pyrenees and Carpathians share, however, one common but not so frequent scenario in which syntectonic evaporitic deposits played a very important role in folding and thrusting.\n\nEvaporitic units formed within the foredeep basins could have different thickness and lateral extent, frequently they migrate towards the foreland following foreland-directed migration of the orogenic wedge. Foredeep-related evaporites are involved in folding and thrusting usually during the latest stages of shortening. They tend to focus detachment levels which often leads to formation of complex structures, including triangle zones and duplexes (for overview of triangle zones and related nomenclature see e.g. Jones, 1996;MacKay et al., 1996), that could form important targets during exploration for hydrocarbons.\n\nIn fold-and-thrust belts detached above evaporites, shortening is usually transferred rather rapidly along the evaporitic levels to the external boundary of the evaporitic basin where evaporites pinch out. Thus, deformed areas usually correspond to the evaporitic depositional extent. At the pinch out, the abrupt increase of internal strength to thrust displacement often pro-duces a backthrust-bounding triangle zone cored by highly deformed rocks.\n\nIn this paper we compare the well-exposed SE frontal part of the Spanish Pyrenees with the buried front of the Polish Carpathians. Amongst other parameters, thickness and lateral extent of evaporitic levels are responsible for changes in the tectonic style of studied frontal parts of orogenic belts.\n\nThe South Pyrenean thrust system consists of three major domains:\n\n1. The inner thrust sheets that include thick basement slices that form the core of the orogenic belt. 2. The cover thrust sheets carrying Mesozoic rocks as well as early Paleogene foreland basin deposits. 3. The most external fold-and-thrust structures detached above foredeep evaporites. The age of deformation migrated towards the South starting in the latest Cretaceous in the north and ending around the middle Oligocene in the South (see Vergés et al., 2002, for further details).\n\nThe most external SE Pyrenean folds and thrusts developed within the foredeep deposits of the Ebro Basin. Several systems of detached anticlines grew above successive syntectonic foreland evaporitic horizons (e.g. Ramírez and Riba, 1975;Vergés et al., 1992).\n\nThe Pyrenean foreland basin is filled by a thick succession of middle Eocene shallows marine marls related to deltas developed along the basin's margins. Above the uppermost shallowing upwards marl unit, about 300 m thick evaporitic succession developed that recorded marine-continental transition (Fig. 2). The Cardona evaporites recorded the end of marine conditions within the Ebro Basin, when the Atlantic connection became closed. The geometry and extent of this evaporitic unit is well known because numerous wells were drilled and several seismic surveys were completed in this area during potash exploration. Above the flat top of the Cardona evaporites a thick prograding alluvial fan system dominated the infill of the Ebro Basin during the late Eocene and Oligocene times. This system comprised the coarse proximal conglomerates of the Solsona Fm. and the distal Súria Fm. (Ramírez and Riba, 1975;Riba et al., 1983). A thick lacustrine sequence with evaporites (Barbastro Fm.) constituted the infill of the central part of the Ebro Basin.\n\nWhereas the Cardona Fm. was probably related to a relatively rapid depositional event infilling a deep NW-SE trending trough, the Barbastro Fm. was progressively migrating towards the south-west and south in front of the advancing Pyrenean deformation (Vergés and Burbank, 1996).\n\nThree sets of folds display different orientations depending on their position within the foreland basin as well as on their relationship with the most external thrust of the cover thrust sheets (Vergés, 2003), (Fig. 3). NW-SE folds are located to the north of the main Cardona evaporitic basin, NE-SW folds are located above the Cardona salt basin, whereas the most external WNW-ESE folds used the Barbastro evaporites to glide.\n\nThe lateral extent of these evaporitic units directly controlled the position and geometry of folds and thrusts during Tertiary shortening. The staircase geometry, with or without superposition, of two evaporitic units is also a very important factor controlling the relationship of two detachment horizons as has been described using field examples from the Pyrenees (Vergés et al., 1992;Sans, 1995;Sans et al., 1996), as well as results of analogue modeling (e.g. Letouzey et al., 1995). When there is a partial superposition of two detachment levels (i.e. in the SE Pyrenees), the detachment climbs up from the lower to the upper evaporites at the pinch out of the lower evaporites. Consequently, single or complex systems of ramps develop together with a hangingwall anticline.\n\nAlong the SE depositional limit of the syntectonic foreland evaporites, the increase of strength controlled by the evaporite pinch-out line forced the detachment thrust to continue to develop along the backthrust bounding a triangle zoom (Fig. 4). This is the case of the frontal el Guix and Barbastro anticlines (Fig. 3).\n\nAlong the SE Pyrenean thrust belt, various evaporitic detachment levels developed within the Pyrenean foreland basin produced tight anticlines separated by relatively wide and flat synclines that can show salt Fig. 3. Structural sketch of the South Pyrenean Triangle Zone developed within the Ebro basin (after Sans, 2003). Red line -location of regional cross-section from Fig. 4 Balanced geological cross-section across the E Pyrenees detached fold-and-thrust belt (after Vergés et al., 2002). Cardona and Barbastro evaporitic formations that controlled development of the frontal Pyrenean thrust are shown in red welding (total evacuation of salt beneath the synclines). At the termination of evaporitic basins, an emerging backthrust and a triangle zone formed, bounding the Pyrenean detached fold-and-thrust belt.\n\nThe Carpathian orogenic belt consists of three main tectonostratigraphic domains: the Inner Carpathians, the Pieniny Klippen Belt, and the Outer Carpathians that have been deformed during several shortening events since the Late Jurassic (see Picha and Golonka, 2005 for a recent overview of geology of the Carpathian region). The Outer Carpathians, that comprise several thrust sheets (nappes) built predominantly of deep-water flysch sediments, are genetically linked to the Miocene Carpathian foredeep basin that developed in front of the advancing orogenic wedge during final thrusting movements (for summary and further references see Oszczypko, 1998;Oszczypko et al., 2005). Sedimentary infill of the Polish Carpathian foredeep basin consists of the Eggerian to Sarmatian (approx. upper Chattian -lower Tortonian) sedimentary sequences (Fig. 5) showing a successive northward migration of the basin axis in front of the advancing thrust sheets (nappes). Within this basin, two major segments (domain) could be distinguished:\n\n1. The inner foredeep basin. 2. The outer foredeep basin, with the boundary between them roughly following present-day frontal overthrust of the Carpathian wedge.\n\nThe inner foredeep basin is composed of the Lower -Middle Miocene (approx. upper Chattian -Serravalian) mostly terrestrial autochthonous deposits (Fig. 5) that are presently entirely overridden by the Carpathian orogenic wedge. Transition from the inner to the outer domain reflects a major northward shift of the Carpathian wedge and related northward displacement of the foredeep's zone of maximum subsidence.\n\nThe outer Carpathian foredeep analyzed in this paper is located to the north from the frontal Carpathian thrust (Fig. 6). It is filled with the Middle Miocene marine deposits, that range from a few hundred meters in thickness in the northern marginal part, up to 3,500 m in the eastern part, in vicinity of the Polish -Ukrainian boundary. Infill of the outer foredeep in front of the Carpathian orogenic wedge consists of the Upper Badenian-Sarmatian (approx. Upper Serravalian -lower Tortonian) succession (Fig. 5). Badenian northward shift of the Carpathian orogenic wedge resulted in a similar shift of the foredeep basin and de-velopment of a wide depositional zone, i.e., the outer Carpathian foredeep basin. Flooding of the Carpathian foreland led to deposition of the Baranów beds that are 10-20 m thick on average, and are built of muddy shales and sandstones and unconformably overlie Mesozoic rocks of the lower (foreland) plate.\n\nRelatively thin siliciclastic Baranów beds are covered by the Upper Badenian evaporitic succession that belongs to Krzyżanowice and Wieliczka formations (cf. Oszczypko et al., 2005). The Krzyżanowice formation comprises gypsum and anhydrite and associated siliciclastic deposits (mainly claystones) and barren and sulfur-bearing limestones that are commonly considered as having originated due to metasomatosis of sulfates. This formation covers a large part of the outer foredeep basin, only between Kraków and Tarnów it is locally replaced by Wieliczka formation. Thickness of the gypsum and anhydrites of the Krzyżanowice formation is in order of several tens of meters in the marginal part of the basin, up to 10-20 m in more the central part (e.g., in vicinity of the present-day frontal Carpathian thrust analyzed in this paper). The Wieliczka formation consists of rock salt with intercalations of claystones and minor sulfates, with total thickness between 30 and 100 m described in the Wieliczka area (Garlicki, 1979). Two main units are distinguished within this succession: stratiform deposits and boulder deposits. Stratiform deposits consist of layered salt beds with relatively minor fine siliciclastic intercalations. Boulder deposits are formed by blocks of salt of different size (from 1 m3 up to even 100,000 m3) embedded within the siliciclastic, generally clayey succession. First deformations of the evaporitic succession most probably occurred already during late phases of its sedimentation (Kolasa and Ślączka, 1985;Ślączka and Kolasa, 1997). Subsequent tectonic movements related to latest phases of the Carpathian collision and thrusting strongly deformed the entire evaporitic succession of the Wieliczka formation.\n\nUpper Badenian evaporites of the Krzyżanowice and Wieliczka formations are covered by shaly-sandy uppermost Badenian (Chodenice and Grabowiec beds) and Sarmatian siliciclastics (Fig. 5), of generally deltaic origin. Their development was related to increased subsidence within the outer foredeep basin, triggered by an increased rate of overthrusting movements within the Carpathian accretionary wedge and/or increased slab-pull processes within the Carpathian subduction zone. These sediments, that presently form the bulk of the foredeep infill in front of the Carpathian orogenic wedge, were supplied mostly from the south, from eroded Carpathians, with minor sediment supply from the north (Fig. 7; cf. Krzywiec, 2001).\n\nAt present, a zone of deformed foredeep deposits (Zgłobice unit; Kotlarczyk, 1985) is located in front Fig. 7.

Blue line -Upper Badenian evaporites (mostly anhydrites).\n\nNote overall progradational pattern of the supra-evaporitic uppermost Badenian -Sarmatian foredeep deposits related to regional sediment supply from the south, from the eroded Carpathians. In front of the Outer flysch Carpathians zone of deformed Miocene foredeep deposits developed, including a triangle zone formed directly above the morphological paleovalley cut within the lower plate (cf. Fig. 9) Fig. 6. Generalized geological map of the central and eastern Polish Carpathians. A-A': regional geoseismic cross-section shown on Fig. 7, red rectangle -area shown in Fig. 8 of the Outer Carpathian pre-Miocene flysch units (nappes). This Miocene tectonic unit has variable width, up to approx. 10 km in the area located between Kraków and Tarnów (Fig. 8).\n\nStructure and evolution of the frontal Carpathian orogenic wedge have been subject of intense studies for many decades, as this area is related to important economic resources like rock salt and hydrocarbons. Numerous structural models have been proposed for the frontal Carpathians, and almost all of them relied on classical concepts of foreland-verging thrust-andfold structural models (e.g., Tołwiński, 1956;Poborski & Skoczylas-Ciszewska, 1963;Kirchner & Połtowicz, 1974;Wdowiarz, 1976;Książkiewicz, 1977;Oszczypko & Tomaś, 1985;Połtowicz, 1991;Karnkowski, 2001). Some publications stressed the role of gravitational tectonics in formation of the frontal Carpathian thrust zone (Połtowicz, 1997(Połtowicz, , 2004)). Jones (1997) postulated that in certain parts of the Polish Carpathian front a triangle zone might have developed with some evidence of backthrusting. It is well known that pres-ence of foredeep evaporites significantly influenced thrust tectonics of the frontal Carpathian orogenic wedge (Połtowicz, 1994).\n\nWithin the area between Kraków and Tarnów (Fig. 8) foredeep Miocene deposits are characterized by two different types of compressional deformation. In the more eastern part of this zone, in the vicinity of Tarnów, recently acquired seismic data calibrated by numerous exploratory wells revealed that the front of the Polish Carpathians located within the Miocene Zgłobice unit is related to wedging tectonics. The geometry of the zone of deformed foredeep deposits is shown on the interpreted seismic profile from Fig. 9 (cf. Krzywiec et al., 2004). The Zgłobice unit is located in the footwall of the main N-verging flysch (pre-Miocene) Carpathian thrust sheet and is composed of three tectonic sub-units (slices) built of deformed Miocene foredeep deposits: Dębno, Wojnicz, and Biadoliny slices (Kirchner & Połtowicz, 1974). The southern Dębno slice is north-verging, whereas the northern Biadoliny slice is defined by south-verging backthrust, Fig. 9. Geoseismic sketch of the frontal Carpathian orogenic wedge east from Kraków (based on Krzywiec et al., 2004). Location is shown in Fig. 8 and, towards the foreland, a north-verging thrust representing the most frontal thrust of the entire Carpathian orogenic wedge (Fig. 9; cf Krzywiec, 2001). The intermediate Wojnicz slice is therefore bordered by the north-verging thrust of the Dębno slice and south-verging backthrust of the Biadoliny slice, and could be defined as a triangle zone. All these structures seem to be detached within the anhydrites of the Krzyżanowice formation, that are characterized in this area by relatively small thickness in order of 10-20 m on average. Only locally, rock salt of the Wieliczka formation has been encountered in several wells.\n\nThe Wojnicz slice is internally strongly deformed as proved by the observed south-dipping reflectors observed in the northern corner of this tectonic slice, beneath the backthrust defining its northern boundary (Fig. 9). These dipping reflectors are attributed to north-directed thrusts carrying uppermost Badenian -Sarmatian siliciclastic deposits above upper Badenian evaporites (anhydrites of the Krzyżanowice formation). These evaporites are partly infilling the paleovalley located beneath the Wojnicz tectonic unit. Well data confirm the involvement of the upper Badenian evaporites (both anhydrite and rock salt) within the northern imbricates of the triangle zone developed within the Zgłobice unit (Poltowicz, 1991).\n\nThe described triangle zone of the Wojnicz slice coincides with a deep erosional paleovalley (Fig. 9) that was incised most probably during Palaeogene inversion of the Mid-Polish Trough (cf. Krzywiec, 2002). The formation of the triangle zone above this paleovalley may have been related to accumulation of thicker upper Badenian evaporites in its axial part that have consequently acted as a more efficient detachment level during shortening. The triangle zone pin line coin-cides with the northern slope of the paleovalley, which may have coincided with either reduction of upper Badenian evaporite thickness or development of locally overlapping evaporitic horizons, which at a later stage may in turn have triggered the initiation of the Biadoliny backthrust.\n\nWest from the Tarnów area, in vicinity of Kraków, a partly different style of deformation is observed within the Zgłobice unit built of deformed foredeep deposits which includes the Wieliczka Salt Mine. This mine, active since the XIth Century and being one of the classical areas of compressional salt tectonics (cf. Jackson, 1995) provides excellent information on the internal structure of the frontal Carpathian orogenic wedge. It is particularly important, as in this part of the frontal orogenic wedge no seismic data exists that could provide reliable information on its internal structure.\n\nIn the Wieliczka area it was possible to link available surface and subsurface datasets to build a relatively well-constrained cross-section (e.g., Tołwiński, 1956;Poborski and Skoczylas-Ciszewska, 1963;Fig 10. Using a model for the Tarnów area described above and cross-section by Tołwiński (1956) as a proxy, we'd like to propose that the Wieliczka Salt Mine is located within the core of the triangle zone being equivalent to the Wojnicz slice from the Tarnów area. To the south, this triangle zone is bounded by the frontal thrust of the Outer (flysch) Carpathians, and to the north by the frontal backthrust that carries Grabowiec beds to the south on top of the imbricates of the Wieliczka tectonic unit. Tectonic imbricates developed above a detachment level located in the salt unit. Each tectonic imbricate is formed by layers of salt followed by chaotic and irregular salt bodies (tens of meters large) corresponding to tectonic salt-breccias (in-Fig. 10. Wieliczka cross-section (redrawn from Tołwiński, 1957, slightly modified and supplemented). According to this model, the Wieliczka Salt Mine is located within the core of the triangle zone. Blue -stratiform salt deposits, see text for further explanations. Location is shown in Fig. 8. Backthrust of the Grabowiec beds, similar to backthrust observed in the vicinity of Tarnów (Fig. 9), is inferred from the regional geometry shown on the original sketch of Tołwiński (1957), is not supported by structural data and therefore should be regarded as hypothetical cluding clays and siltstones) as a product of erosion of basin margins during thrust emplacement (Kolasa & Ślączka, 1985;Ślączka & Kolasa, 1997). Beneath deformed foredeep succession that includes strongly deformed rock salt of the Wieliczka formation, autochthonous evaporites are present, developed as a rather thin and continuous anhydritic layer, similarly to, e.g., the Tarnów area described above (cf. Garlicki, 1979;Połtowicz, 1993). All these elements define a triangle zone similar to the triangle zone of the Wojnicz slice from the vicinity of Tarnów described above. Similarly to the Pyrenean thrust front in the Cardona area, the Wieliczka triangle zone might have formed where lat-eral changes of evaporitic facies occurred at the transition from relatively thick rock salt of the Wieliczka formation to significantly thinner anhydrite facies of the Krzyżanowice formation.\n\nThe main difference between the two segments of the frontal Carpathians described above is the different involvement of evaporitic units in thrust tectonics. In the Wieliczka area relatively thick rock salt units make up almost the entire axial part of the triangle zone, while in the Tarnów area evaporites are very locally present within the core of the triangle zone and serve mainly as a preferred detachment level. a b c\n\nThe fronts of the Pyrenees and Carpathians share a common feature that is the presence of syntectonic foredeep / foreland evaporitic levels that developed in the course of foreland progradation of the advancing orogenic wedges. These evaporites exerted a strong control on the evolution of both thrust systems during late stages of their development (Fig. 11).\n\nWithin the SE frontal Pyrenees, thick and laterally extent evaporites were deposited from mid-Eocene to early Oligocene times (Cardona and Barbastro formations, respectively). The margins of the evaporitic basins defined the position of tectonic structures like ramps and backthrusts as well as of triangle zones. Zones of overlap of two successive evaporitic levels define location of anticlines on the hangingwall of the thrust ramps, whereas the external pinch outs of the uppermost evaporitic level define the position of backthrusts (Fig. 11A).\n\nThe central part of the Polish Carpathian orogenic wedge is characterized by the presence of Middle Miocene foredeep evaporites, that also played an important role in shaping of the orogenic front. The most frontal Carpathian unit built of the Miocene foredeep deposits (i.e. the Zglobice unit) is detached above evaporites of late Badenian age. In the Tarnów area, where evaporites comprise mainly relatively thin anhydrites, this unit is internally deformed by an imbricate thrust system developed between the north-directed frontal Carpathian thrust and the south-directed Biadoliny backthrust (Fig. 11B). This backthrust, carrying upper Badenian evaporites in the lowermost part of its hangingwall, formed at the tip point of the triangle zone of the Wojnicz slice. Location of this tip point may have been controlled either by location of a zone of rapid thinning of anhydrites of the Krzyżanowice formation above the northern slope of the pre-Miocene erosional paleovalley, or by overlap zone of two anhydritic units above this slope.\n\nThe Zgłobice unit in the Wieliczka area is characterized by a system of north-directed tectonic slices carrying rock salt interlayered by siliciclastics (Fig. 11C). The possible existence of a south-directed backthrust in the front of the Wieliczka imbricate system, suggested by previously published geological crosssections based on well and mine data, strongly indicates the existence of a triangle zone equivalent to the triangle zone described within the Wojnicz slice in the Tarnów area. In a similar way as for the Cardona thrust front, the Wieliczka triangle zone might have formed where lateral changes of evaporitic facies occurred at the transition from salt to anhydrite facies.\n\nPiotr Krzywiec • Jaume Vergés"
