A scaffold-associated region (SAR) of DNA has been identified 8 to 9 kb downstream of the single-copy pea plastocyanin gene in proximity to a repetitive sequence present in 300 copies in the pea haploid genome. lsolated restriction fragments from within the SAR can bind to scaffold preparations in a binding assay in vitro. The nucleotide sequence of the SAR indicates a 540-bp 77% A+T-rich region containing many sequence elements in common with SARs from other organisms.

    "full_text": "The importance of studies of plant nuclear architecture and the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes has become recognized as studies on gene expression have progressed (Kahl, 1988;Heslop-Harrison and Bennett, 1990;Jackson, 1991). Not surprisingly, plant nuclei have been shown to have many features in common with those of other eukaryotes. Extraction of plant nuclei with nonionic detergents, high molarity salt solutions, and treatment with nucleases has resulted in preparations of the nuclear matrix, a proteinaceous network within the nucleus (Ghosh and Dey, 1986;Galcheva-Gargova et al., 1988;Bevan et al., 1991;Moreno Diaz de Ia Espina et al., 1991). The nuclear matrix, together with the associated nuclear lamina underlying the nuclear envelope, is likely to be of considerable importance for interphase chromosome structure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy has recently revealed a plant chromosome structure that appears to be consistent with the organization of DNA into 10to 1 5 -1 \"\n\n\"beads on a string\" fibers, which are then wound into 30-nm solenoids and probably then into loops (Wanner et al., 1991). Such an organization is known to exist in animal cells (reviewed in van Holde, 1989). Further condensation of these loops is believed to lead to structures visible in the light microscope (Nelson et al., 1986;Filipski et al., There is considerable evidence from many nonplant sources, including Drosophila (Gasser and Laemmli, 1986b), chicken (Phi- Van and Stratling, 1988), mouse 1990).\n\n' Current address: European Molecular Biology Laboratory, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed. (Cockerill and Garrard, 1986), HeLa cells (Jarman and Higgs, 1988), and yeast (Amati and Gasser, 1988), that the organization of DNA into loops of 5 to 200 kb (Jackson et al., 1990) is maintained by the periodic attachment of the DNA to a proteinaceous chromosome scaffold. How these scaffolds relate to the nuclear matrix is as yet unclear. In many eukaryotes, the scaffold-associated regions (SARs) of DNA have been isolated and analyzed for common features. They have often been found to lie in AT-rich regions (Gasser and Laemmli, 1986a;Jarman and Higgs, 1988;Blasquez et al., 1989) and to contain sequences related to the Drosophila topoisomerase II consensus sequence (Gasser and Laemmli, 1986a). They may also contain sequences related to T-box and A-box sequences identified by Gasser and Laemmli (1986b) and to autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). Severa1 of the ARS-like regions have been shown to function as ARSs in vivo (Sykes et al., 1988;Amati et al., 1990). In some cases, comapping of SARs with transcriptional enhancers has also been noted (Cockerill and Garrard, 1986;Gasser and Laemmli, 1986b). All of these characteristics have led to the speculation that enzymes regulating torsional stress, proteins enhancing or silencing transcription, and even replication complexes may bind at the bases of loops to exert their effects on each loop and the genes therein (Jackson, 1991). Some credence has been given to this speculation by another property of SARs: namely, their ability when placed upstream and downstream of reporter genes in transgenic organisms to alleviate commonly observed position effects on the expression of the reporter gene (Stief et al., 1989;Phi-Van et al., 1990). This could be explained by the transgene forming a loop that is regulated independently of the flanking host DMA. This explanation is complicated, however, by the observation that some SARs have been mapped within transcribed sequences of some genes (Cockerill and Garrard, 1986), including within introns (Kas and Chasin, 1987;Mielke et al., 1990). Therefore, a current hypothesis is that at least two types of SARs exist (Surdej et al., 1990;Vaughn et al., 1990;Zenk et al., 1990;Jackson, 1991). The most stable type is bound by proteins with a high affinity, for which several candidates, including topoisomerase II, exist (Hofmann et al., 1989;von Kries et al., 1991). These SARs are thought to be permanent throughout the cell cycle and are not tissue specific or developmentally specific. They may define a loop containing one or several transcription units. A second type of SAR is bound by proteins with a lower affinity and may represent transient attachment of transcribed or replicating sequences to scaffold-bound polymerases.\n\nIn this study, our goal was to identify possible SARs in the vicinity of the single-copy plastocyanin gene in pea. Isolated pea chromatin was treated with lithium diiodosalicylate (LIS) to remove histones and digested with restriction enzymes to release the DNA in the loop regions, as described by Mirkovitch et al. (1984). The scaffold-associated DNA was collected by centrifugation, and the scaffold-associated and released DNA fractions were labeled and used to probe DNA gel blots of the cloned plastocyanin region. With this approach, we have obtained evidence for an SAR between 8 and 9 kb downstream of this gene. The SAR was identified because of its proximity to a copy of a repetitive sequence that occurs at about 300 different sites in the genome, nearly always closely associated with an SAR. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the SAR was located in a highly AT-rich region.\n\nThe experimental approach for the identification of SARs was essentially that described by Mirkovitch et al. (1984), in which LIS-extracted chromatin is digested with restriction enzymes and the scaffold-associated DNA and loop DNA are separated by centrifugation. Pea nuclei were prepared from 8-day-old pea shoots by homogenization with a blender and differential centrifugation, as described by Gallagher and Ellis (1982). The nuclei were purified by centrifugation on a Percoll step gradient over a 2 M sucrose pad, with the nuclei banding on top of the sucrose pad. The purity and yield were assessed by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the nuclei were frozen at -80°C in small aliquots until needed. Gallagher and Ellis (1982) showed that this procedure yielded intact, transcriptionally active nuclei, even after storage at -80°C, although the nuclear envelope was damaged during the extraction procedure. The thawed nuclei were washed to remove nucleoplasm, and the chromatin structure was stabilized by heat treatment at 37°C for 20 min in the presence of 0.5 mM CuSO 4 , as described by Kas and Chasin (1987). Histones were removed by treatment with LIS. The optimum amount of LIS for maximum histone extraction varies from organism to organism (Izaurralde et al., 1988). For extraction of pea histones, various concentrations from 6 to 50 mM LIS were tried. It can be seen from Figure 1 that 6 mM LIS was sufficient to remove almost all histones. Few other differences in the polypeptide pattern can be observed between the heat-treated, LIS-extracted pea nuclei and the nonheat-treated, nonextracted pea nuclei. The polypeptides at approximately 25 kD are components of the light-harvesting chlorophyll II protein, which is a contaminant from thylakoid membranes present in the nuclei preparation. It is difficult to remove this residual thylakoid contamination from pea nuclei preparations, but its presence does not appear to affect subsequent experiments. The silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel shows the protein composition of unextracted pea leaf nuclei (lane A) and LIS-extracted nuclei (lane B). The nuclei were prepared as described in Methods. Nuclear scaffolds were isolated after extraction of nuclei with 6 mM LIS. H, histone; LHCII, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein II. Size markers are given in kilodaltons.\n\nA Repeated Sequence 8 to 9 kb Downstream of the Plastocyanin Gene 1s Commonly Linked to an SAR LIS-extracted nuclei were digested with restriction enzymes for 3 hr at 37OC. A total fraction of the digestion mixture was removed, and the remainder was centrifuged at 24009 to pellet scaffold-associated material. DNA was extracted from the total, supernatant, and pellet fractions after removal of proteins by treatment with proteinase K. The pellet fraction should be enriched in SAR-containing DNA. Digestion of LIS-extracted nuclei with EcoRl released approximately 85% of the DNA into the supernatant.\n\nIn the original approach, Mirkovitch et al. (1984) loaded equal amounts of total, supernatant, and pellet DNA on an agarose gel, blotted this by the method of Southern (1 975), and probed the blot with the regions of DNA that were being examined for the presence of SARs. Fragments of DNA identified as being enriched in the pellet track compared with the supernatant track were presumed to carry SARs. This approach has been used on many occasions as a means of identifying SARs in nonplant systems (Mirkovitch et al., 1984;Kas and Chasin, 1987;Jarman and Higgs, 1988;Surdej et al., 1990). However, with pea this approach was found to be unsuitable because the single-copy sequence signal around plastocyanin is obscured by the background caused by high levels of endogenous nuclease (Jenns and Bryant, 1978;Bryant, 1980). A series of tests were carried out to try to inactivate the nuclease. LIS-extracted nuclei were incubated overnight at 37°C in buffer D containing one of the following: CaCh (0.8 mM, 8.0 mM), EGTA (0.5 mM, 5.0 mM, 50 mM), MgCI2 (50 mM, 100 mM), or various combinations of these. It was found that inhibition was maximized in the presence of 0.5 mM EGTA with 50 mM MgCh. Unfortunately, this combination, and other less effective ones, also inhibited the restriction enzymes with which the scaffold-associated DNA was to be treated. Obviously, heat inactivation of the nuclease could not be used because of the danger of disrupting scaffold attachments. Therefore, an alternative approach to identifying SARs was developed. A 15.3-kb BamHl fragment containing the 500-bp single-copy pea plastocyanin gene was cloned into pUC18 (Last and Gray, 1989). The resulting plasmid, pBGPC1, mapped with various enzymes, is shown in Figure 2. Seven double digestions were carried out on the plasmid, and these were electrophoresed in triplicate on 0.8% agarose gels, followed by blotting onto nylon membranes by the method of Southern (1975). The enzymes used for the digestions were: BamHl with Hindll, EcoRl with Hindll, BamHl with Sphl, EcoRl with Sphl, Hindlll with Sphl, Kpnl with Sphl, and EcoRl with Pstl. The filters were probed with the total, supernatant, and pellet fractions labeled with 3'P-dATP. Because the pellet fraction should be enriched in DNA fragments containing SARs, it was expected that any plasmid bands carrying an SAR would show an enhanced intensity on the autoradiograph of the pellet-probed filter. Figure 3 shows autoradiographs of filters probed with the total, supernatant, and pellet fractions obtained by digestion of LIS-extracted nuclei with EcoRI. In each of the tracks probed with the pellet fraction, there are bands showing fivefold to 1 O-fold enhanced intensities (determined by scanning the autoradiographs) compared with the total and supernatant probed tracks. By reference to the restriction map of the 15.3-kb BamHl fragment (Figure 2), the region showing the enhanced hybridization to the pellet fraction was localized to approximately 8 to 9 kb downstream of the pea plastocyanin gene. This region contains sequences that hybridize to sequences enriched in the scaffold-associated DNA and is a good candidate for an SAR.\n\nThe intensity of hybridization to the different fragments in the total-probed tracks indicates, however, the presence of repeated sequence copies within the 15.3-kb BamHl fragment. The single-copy regions, including the plastocyanin coding region, within the fragment were not detectable with this method because of the lack of sensitivity. The repetitive sequence DNA could be mapped from the complete set of double digestions to two positions: one is about 5 kb upstream of the plastocyanin gene and the other is 8 to 9 kb downstream of the gene. The repetitive The plasmid pBGPCI was cleaved with various restriction enzymes and the DMA from each incubation was divided into three. Each aliquot was electrophoresed so that identical patterns were obtained on three agarose gels. The fragments on each gel were transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane. Each of the three identical filters obtained was probed with 0.5 ^g of 32 P-labeled DMA from one fraction (total, supernatant, or pellet) of LIS-extracted nuclei digested with EcoRI. Hybridization was at 65°C, and the washes were carried out at high stringency according to the GeneScreen Plus protocol. Single tracks from each of the three autoradiographs are aligned for clarity, together with a track from an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to show the band migration pattern. The position of the bands in pBGPCI can be determined from the map in Figure 2. Lanes T, track from filter probed with total fraction; lanes S/N, track from filter probed with supernatant fraction; lanes P, track from filter probed with pellet fraction; lanes O, track from original agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Fragments indicated with an arrow carry the downstream repeat, and other marked bands carry the upstream repeat. sequence 8 to 9 kb downstream of the gene corresponds to the region showing enhanced hybridization to the scaffold-associated DMA. The copy number of each of these repeats was investigated using a dot blot with 10-fold dilutions of pea nuclear DNA and 10-fold dilutions of known copy number equivalents of plasmid containing the repeat. Each dot blot was probed with a plasmid-derived fragment containing one of the repeats. It was found that the repeats upstream and downstream of plastocyanin differed in copy number by about 50-fold and were unrelated to each other. The upstream repeat had a copy number of about 15,000 per haploid genome, and the downstream repeat had a copy number of about 300 per haploid genome. Figure 4 shows a DNA gel blot probed with the 15.3-kb BamHI fragment. This indicates that the upstream repeat is related to other sequences in the genome that commonly occur on BamHI fragments of 2.0 kb and 0.7 kb. The downstream repeat occurs at other sites in the genome on BamHI fragments of unrelated length (data not shown). This property of the downstream repeat explains why probing DNA gel blots that were run according to the method of Mirkovitch et al. (1984) with the 15.3-kb BamHI fragment from pBGPCI could not detect an enrichment of fragments in the pellet track related to the downstream repeat.\n\nTotal, supernatant, and pellet fractions produced by digestion of LIS-extracted nuclei with EcoRI plus BamHI and with Hindlll alone were also used to probe a similar set of filters, as shown in Figure 3. In both cases, the same plasmid bands as in Figure 3 were enhanced in the autoradiographs of the pellet-probed filter (data not shown). This indicates that the downstream repeat, wherever in BamHI-cut pea genomic DMA (10 ^g) was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus, and probed with the 15.3-kb BamHI fragment from pBGPd. Hybridization was at 65°C, and the washes were carried out at high stringency according to the GeneScreen Plus protocol. The two bands at 2.0 and 0.7 kb (lane B) are related to the repetitive sequence found upstream of the plastocyanin gene. Length markers were Hindlll and EcoRI fragments of X DNA (lane A). the genome it occurs, is not normally separated from an SAR by EcoRI, BamHI, or Hindlll digestion. It was not possible from these data to be sure that the actual copy of the downstream repeat on the 15.3 kb BamHI fragment was associated with an SAR. It remained a possibility that although in the majority of cases the repeat was associated with an SAR, in this specific case it was not. Therefore, a binding assay was used to address this point.\n\nBinding assays involved the addition of 32 P-end-labeled plasmid-derived fragments during restriction enzyme digestion of LIS-extracted nuclei, followed by detection of the fragments specifically associated with the scaffoldcontaining pellet fraction. End-labeled fragments were obtained from pROS651, which contains the 2.6-kb Hindlll-BamHI fragment of pBGPd in pUC18 (Figure 2), by digestion with Oral, EcoRI, and BamHI. They were added to LIS-extracted nuclei in the presence and absence of 200 n § mL~1 unlabeled pea DNA as a competitor, and the endogenous DNA was then digested for 3 hr at 37°C with EcoRI and BamHI. The restriction enzymes were selected because they gave plasmid fragments of lengths equal to or less than 2.0 kb, which is an important factor in the success of these binding assays (Amati and Gasser, 1988;Izaurralde et al., 1988). When longer fragments are used, nonspecific binding has often been observed, possibly because of large fragments being trapped in the endogenous DNA and to steric hindrance of SAR binding by large adjacent regions of non-SAR-containing DNA. Pea DNA was used as a competitor because it was believed that nonspecific binding to the eukaryotic scaffold could best be eliminated by DNA of the correct base pair composition. This decision was made because other research (Kas and Chasin, 1987, in addition to our own (see below) showed that vector sequences do not seem to bind well, even nonspecifically, to scaffolds.\n\nAfter restriction enzyme digestion, the scaffold-associated material was isolated by centrifugation and digested with proteinase K, and the DNA was extracted. The purified DNA and a sample of input-labeled DNA were electrophoresed on an agarose gel that was stained with ethidium bromide to check for digestion of both endogenous and competitor DNA before being fixed and dried for exposure to film. The resulting autoradiograph is shown in Figure 5. It is apparent that in the absence of competitor DNA, three plasmid-derived fragments of 0.95, 0.23 and 0.11 kb were preferentially bound to the pea scaffolds. These fragments contained only pea sequences, unlike the other large unbound fragments that were entirely (1.1 and 0.7 kb) or partially (2.0 kb) vector D.NA. The failure of these vector sequences to bind even nonspecifically to the pea scaffolds is probably a feature of their different base composition. In the presence of competitor DNA, one of the fragments (0.95 kb) ceased to bind the scaffold, leaving only the two fragments of 0.23 and 0.11 kb specifically bound. At higher levels of competitor DNA (500 ^9 ml\" 1 ), this binding was no longer seen. This experiment provides support for the presence of an SAR on the 15.3-kb cloned plastocyanin fragment, which is closely linked to the downstream repeat. This region was, therefore, sequenced to allow comparison with nonplant SARs.\n\nA fragment of approximately 1.4 kb in length containing the SAR and downstream repeat was subcloned from the 3' end of the 15.3-kb BamHI fragment. The sequence is shown in Figure 6. Within this sequence is a region of approximately 540 bp that is 77% A-t-T-rich (base pairs 80 to 620) bounded on either side by DNA of 54% A+T. This AT-rich region extends from the center of the 0.23-kb Oral fragment (5') to well beyond the 0.11-kb Oral fragment 32 P-end-labeled fragments from pROS651 cut with Oral, EcoRI, and BamHI (Figure 2) were incubated with LIS-extracted nuclei during digestion with BamHI and EcoRI in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor DNA. Scaffold-bound DNA was isolated by centrifugation; the DNA extracted from the pellet fraction was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Lane I, input DNA; lane 0, 0 /ig mL~' competitor DNA; lane 200, 200 ng mL~1 pea competitor DNA. The amount of DNA loaded in the input track is about 5% of that used in each assay tube. Only about 1 % of the labeled DNA added to each tube binds to the scaffold; therefore, supernatant tracks are not shown as the depletion of bands would not be apparent. Fragment lengths are given in kilobases. Double arrowheads mark fragments bound to the scaffold.\n\n(3'), both of which were shown to be specifically retained in the scaffold-binding assay (Figure 5).\n\nThe 5' end point of the downstream repeat was determined using dot blots. For these, the five Rsal fragments covering this region were used as probes (5' 390 bp, 230 bp, 220 bp, 320 bp, and 160 bp 3'). Each blot carried 10-fold dilutions of pea nuclear DNA and 10-fold dilutions of known copy number equivalents of plasmid DNA that covered the downstream repeat region. Each blot was probed with a different Rsal fragment from this region. Four of these fragments, 230, 220, 320, and 160 bp, gave copy numbers for the downstream repeat of about 300 per haploid genome, but the other fragment (390 bp) gave a copy number of less than 10. This showed that the 5' end of the downstream repeat lies within the 230-bp Rsal fragment in which the 3' end of the AT-rich region is found. The 3' end of the downstream repeat occurs near to, or most likely beyond, the end of the 15.3-kb BamHI fragment. It appears, therefore, that the SAR and the repeated sequence found downstream of the pea plastocyanin gene do not coincide, but are adjacent, with the SAR slightly 5' to the repeat, unless the two overlap in a small region on the 230-bp Rsal fragment.\n\nWe have demonstrated that a DNA sequence can act as an SAR in plants. Previously, there have been reports of plant sequences binding to scaffolds in other organisms. Jacobsen et al. (1990) reported that the promoter region of the soybean leghemoglobin Ibc 3 gene binds to the Drosophila scaffold, and recently a 1.3-kb fragment from the first intron of the potato ST-LS1 gene was found to have the properties of an SAR in transfection assays in murine cells (Mielke et al., 1990). However, in neither of these instances was the sequence shown to function as an SAR in plants. Hadwiger (1988) briefly mentioned that clusters of topoisomerase II cleavage sites and \"indications of scaffold attachment regions\" had been demonstrated in the region 5' to the disease resistance response gene PG49 of pea, but no further details have been forthcoming. The work reported here has shown that nuclear scaffolds and the associated DNA may be prepared from young pea shoots using the heat stabilization and low-salt US extraction procedures common to many nonplant studies. The DNA from these preparations may be used to identify SARs present in cloned restriction fragments of plant DNA.\n\nThe methods of preparing and extracting nuclei for studies of this kind are somewhat controversial. Mirkovitch et al. (1984) originally used extraction with LIS to overcome potential slippage of SARs during extraction of nuclei with 2 M NaCI. The LIS extraction procedure is known to remove histones efficiently from isolated nuclei, allowing the DNA to \"unravel\" to a considerable extent while still maintaining attachments of DNA to the central protein scaffold. However, both this method and the 2 M NaCI method have been criticized for the unphysiological nature of their buffers and the potential for artifacts to occur (Jackson et al., 1988). Jackson et al. have also criticized the traditional way of preparing nuclei in nonisotonic conditions (Verheijen et al., 1988) to prevent aggregation of chromatin. Jackson et al. (1988), therefore, have devised an alternative method for preparing nonplant scaffolds and attached DNA that involves embedding the cells in agarose before lysis and extracting the nuclei under more physiological conditions. Nuclei prepared in this way maintain\n\nU a L A R L -. _ . 1 C A CACATTTATGATTAGGAAACTTTTTAATATATT 110 37/38bp 37/ 38bp . . -111 TTATAGATTTCTTATCCATCATATAAAAATACATAATTAATCATACGATTTTGAGATACATATTCTGACGTA TCAAATTCTAATTAAATTTTAAAATATTTTAGTGACGT 220 3 9bp 39bp . -10/11ARS.-. 221 p AGACG-&&2-GTATATTATAGATCACATTCATAGGTCATTTTAT-ATTATG 330 llbp lObp lObp . -.\n\n-.\n\nlQmJF&-.

Unfortunately, the method is not easily applicable to intact plant cells because their cell walls remain an obstacle, although it could perhaps be applied to protoplasts.\n\nIn our procedure for isolating SARs, we were able to detect an SAR downstream of the pea plastocyanin gene because the SAR was adjacent to a repetitive sequence. lnformation about the amount of DNA typically bound to pea scaffolds after enzyme digestion (about 15%) and the amount of DNA used as a probe from each fraction (the same in each case), as well as information from scans of the autoradiographs, makes it possible to say that in at least 85% of the positions where the downstream repeat occurs, it is close to an SAR (i.e., not separated from one by EcoRI, BamHI, or Hindlll digestion). There are precedents for this close association of repetitive sequences with scaffolds (Razin et al., 1979(Razin et al., , 1986;;Pauli et al., 1989;Cockerill, 1990;Kalandadze et al., 1990), and it may be that repetitive DNA preferentially integrates into the genome close to SARs, perhaps facilitated by the action of the double-stranded DNA cutter, topoisomerase 11, which is proposed to bind at these sites (Adachi et al., 1989).\n\nThere has been a suggestion that topoisomerase I 1 bound to SARs can mediate illegitimate recombination (Blasquez et al., 1989), and eukaryotic topoisomerase I 1 has been shown to mediate illegitimate recombination in vitro (Bae et al., 1988). However, the role of topoisomerase II as a scaffolding protein remains uncertain (Heck et al., 1988;Jackson, 1991;Whalen et al., 1991), although it probably does play a role in the resolution of interlocking chromosomes at mitosis and meiosis (Moens, 1990) and therefore may bind at SARs.\n\nThe most obvious feature of the nucleotide sequence of the SAR is the 540-bp AT-rich region. The binding assay (Figure 5) showed that the SAR has at least two separable regions that bind to the scaffold, one of which is on the 11 O-bp Dral fragment entirely within the AT-rich region.\n\nThe other Dral fragment of 230 bp carries about 120 bp of this AT-rich sequence, and it seems likely, therefore, that the binding of this fragment is also mediated by the AT-rich part. The three intervening Dral fragments may contain binding sites, but this would not be detected by this assay in which fragments of very short length do not bind scaffolds (Mielke et al., 1990). It is also possible that any binding sites in this region would be disrupted by the Dral sites. If the AT-rich region corresponds exactly with the SAR, then the SAR is about 540 bp in length. This is in keeping with the observed lengths of other SARs, which range from 0.5 to 2 kb (Gasser and Laemmli, 1986a;Pauli et al., 1989;Jackson, 1991). Although other researchers' data, which involve control fragments with an A+T content of 60% to 70% in the binding assay, suggest that AT richness alone is not sufficient to indicate an SAR (Amati and Gasser, 1988;Jarman and Higgs, 1988;Mielke et al., 1990), this feature is almost always a property of those SARs analyzed to date (Kas and Chasin, 1987;Phi-Van and Stratling, 1988;Mielke et al., 1990).\n\nBearing in mind the repetitive nature of the sequenced DNA and the possibility of similarity to other SARs, the 1380-bp sequence was checked against the EMBL and GenBank data bases, but no significant matches were detected. However, comparison with other SARs led to various observations. The whole sequence was scanned for sequences related to the Drosophila topoisomerase II consensus GTN(A/T)A(T/C)ATTNATNN(G/A) (Sander and Hsieh, 1985) because possible binding sites for this enzyme are often clustered within SAR DNA from other organisms (Gasser and Laemmli, 1986a), even if they are not invertebrates. No perfect matches, and only one 14 out of 15 bp match, were observed (see Figure 6). Several 13 out of 15 bp matches were found, including one outside the AT-rich region. However, the probability of such matches occurring in DNA of 77% A+T composition is high. Obviously, it would be much more meaningful to look for pea topoisomerase II binding sites, but the binding site for this enzyme is not yet known.\n\nThe DNA was also scanned for sequences related to the T-box and A-box regions identified by Gasser and Laemmli (1986b). The T-box consensus is TTA/TTT/ ATTT/ATT, and one 1 O out of 1 O match was found (Figure 6); however, there is again a high probability of this occurring at random in DNA of this sequence composition. Several 9 out of 1 O bp matches were observed, including one in the DNA with an A+T content of 54%. The A-box consensus is AATAAAT/CAAA. Three 9 out of 1 O matches to this were found within the region with an A+T content Of 77%.\n\nThe sequenced region was examined for ARS sequences (A/TTTTATA/GTTTA/T) that have been shown to comap with SARs in some instances (Sykes et al., 1988;Amati et al., 1990). There were no perfect matches, but three 1 O out of 11 matches were found (see Figure 6), one of which was located in the DNA with an A+T content of 54%, and the other two in the AT-rich DNA. One of these is very close to the only AATATATTT site in the whole sequence. This sequence has been identified as a nucleation site for strand separation under certain conditions (Kohwi-Shigematsu and Kohwi, 1990). This property may be important for the activity of replication origins (which often coincide with ARSs) and may also be possessed by the sequence ATATTT under some conditions. The sequence ATATTT has been shown to be overrepresented in a number of SARs (Cockerill and Garrard, 1986;Mielke et al., 1990), and in the pea sequence it occurs eight times in the entire 1380-bp fragment, all between base pairs 1 O0 and 410 (Figure 6), five times on one strand and three times on the other. It is possible that this sequence, which can form part of the topoisomerase II recognition sequence, is important in SAR binding and function. This is supported by the fact that when adenine residues of an AATATATTT motif in the SAR of the human p-interferon gene flanking region were mutated, the attachment activity was decreased (Mielke et al., 1990).\n\nOther features of the sequence that are of note include two unrelated sets of direct repeats. One is a 39-bp perfect repeat that occurs with no intervening DNA in the region with an A+T content of 77%, and the other is a 37 out of 38 bp repeat, again with no interspersed base pairs, at the very 5' end of the sequenced region, in the DNA with an A+T content of 54%. One 11 -bp direct repeat and one 1 O-bp direct repeat exist in the region with an A+T content of 77%, and a different 10-bp repeat is found in the DNA with an A+T content of 54%. The significance of such repeats is not known, but direct repeats have previously been observed in SAR-containing DNA. Gasser and Laemmli (1986b) reported an SAR upstream of the Drosophila heat shock protein 70 gene, which contains a 35bp repeat separated by a 137-bp sequence and a 12-bp repeat separated by an 8-bp sequence (Karch et al., 1981). Kas and Chasin (1987) found various direct and inverted repeats in an SAR in the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase gene, and Opstelten et al. (1989) reported a considerable number of direct repeats at SARs in Physarum polycephalum.\n\nIt will be of interest to investigate the possibility that the inclusion of plant SARs in constructs for plant transformation can alleviate the commonly observed position effects on expression of transgenes. In other organisms, transgenes bounded by SARs have often been found to be expressed at a leve1 much more consistent with their copy number than controls in which an SAR is not present (Stief et al., 1989;Phi-Van et al., 1990). This property may be due to the SARs providing anchorage points to the scaffold and isolating the transgene from the surrounding DNA. It is possible, however, that the position effect problem may not be resolved in such a straightforward way in plants because of the greater methylation that occurs in these organisms (Hepburn, 1988).\n\nSeeds of Pisum sativum (var Feltham First) were sown in Fisons Levington cornpost and grown under a 16 hr light, 8 hr dark regimen for 8 days. Daylight was supplemented by artificial light providing 150 pE m-' sec-' of photosynthetically active radiation.\n\nNuclei were isolated from 120 g of 8-day-old pea shoots essentially as described by Gallagher and Ellis (1982). The method involved soaking the leaves in ice-cold ether, washing severa1 times with isotonic buffer, and then homogenizing with a blender. The homogenate was filtered through muslin, the residue reextracted with buffer, and the nuclei pelleted by centrifuging the combined filtrates. The pellet from 120 g of leaves was suspended in 12 mL of buffer B (0.44 M sucrose, 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 1 O mM MgCI2, 1 O mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% Ficoll F400, 5% dextran T40, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and layered onto six Percoll step gradients, consisting of 7-mL layers of 40%, 6O%, and 80% (v/v) Percoll on a 7-mL 2 M sucrose pad in 30\" Corex tubes. The Percoll contained 0.44 M sucrose, 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, and 10 mM MgCI2. After centrifugation at 40009 for 30 min, the nuclei banded at the surface of the sucrose pad. The nuclei were washed twice with buffer B and suspended in storage buffer (0.44 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCI2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% [v/v] glycerol) at a concentration of 6 x 10' nuclei mL-'. The nuclei were stored at -80°C until required. About 6 x 106 nuclei were obtained per gram of fresh leaf tissue.\n\nTypically about 2 x 106 nuclei were treated essentially as described by KBs and Chasin (1 987). The nuclei were removed from the storage buffer by centrifuging at 24009 for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and were then washed three times by centrifuging at 12009 for 1 min in 1 mL of buffer A (15 mM Tris HCI, pH 7.4, 20 mM KCI, 60 mM NaCI, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermine, 0.125 mM spermidine, 1 YO [v/v] thiodiglycol, 0.1 ?'O digitonin). All solutions containing digitonin were centrifuged before use to remove insoluble material. The scaffold structure of the pelleted chromatin was stabilized by the addition of 40 pL of buffer A without EDTA but with 0.5 mM CuS04 and incubation at 37OC for 20 min. Histone extraction was accomplished in the same Eppendorf tube by the addition of 1.5 mL of buffer C (6 mM LIS, 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 M lithium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% digitonin) and incubation for 1 O min at 25OC. The histone-depleted scaffolds were collected by centrifugation at 24009 for 20 min at 4OC and washed extensively (five to six times) with buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 70 mM NaCI, 20 mM KCI, 10 mM MgCI,, 0.125 mM spermidine, 0.05 mM spermine, 0.1% digitonin) to remove LIS, which interferes with the subsequent restriction enzyme digestions. The histone-depleted scaffolds were suspended in 500 p L of buffer D, 250 units of high concentration restriction enzyme (>40 units/pL, Boehringer Mannheim) were added, and the sus- pension was incubated for 3 hr at 37OC on a rotating wheel. After 90 min, another 250 units of restriction enzyme were added. At the end of the incubation, a 100-pL aliquot was removed to provide a total sample, and the remainder was centrifuged at 24009 for 10 min at 4OC. The supernatant fraction was kept and the pellet rewashed with 400 pL of buffer D. The two supernatants were combined to give the supernatant sample. The pellet was suspended in 400 pL of buffer D. Proteins were removed from the total, supernatant, and pellet fractions by incubation with 0.1% SDS and proteinase K at 1 mg mL-' overnight at 30°C. To each sample, 1 pg of tRNA (wheat germ, type V from Sigma) was added as a carrier, and the samples were phenol extracted twice (using phenol equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), chloroform extracted once, and ethanol precipitated. Samples were dissolved in 30 pL of 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 O pL were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels in 0.04 M Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 0.001 M EDTA to check the quantity of DNA in each sample, the absence of excessive nuclease problems, and complete digestion.\n\nUnextracted and LIS-extracted nuclear samples (1 x 1 O5 nuclei each in 40 pL of buffer D) were prepared for electrophoresis by treating with 8 pg mL-' DNase I for 20 min at 25OC. Protein was pelleted by centrifuging at 24009 for 3 min and denatured by suspension in 10 pL of loading buffer containing 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and boiling for 1 min. Samples were loaded onto a 21% polyacrylamide gel, with a 4% stacking gel, containing 2-amino-2-methyl-1 ,Spropanediol (Ammediol) as a buffer (Bury, 1981). Gels were poured in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus with 0.5-mm spacers. After electrophoresis for 1.5 hr at 17 mA, the gels were silver stained according to Blum et al. (1987).\n\nDNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in 0.04 M Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 0.001 M EDTA and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (Du Pont-New England Nuclear) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the method of Southern (1975). Probes were produced by labeling with PP-dATP using the random-priming method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (1 983). Dot blot analyses and hybridization were carried out at 65OC according to the GeneScreen Plus protocol booklet (Du Pont-New England Nuclear). For dot blot analyses, 1 O-fold dilutions of pea genomic DNA prepared from purified nuclei were used as well as 10-fold dilutions of known copy number equivalents of plasmid carrying the fragment of interest. The same fragment was used to probe the filter. Gels and autoradiograms were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics 300A scanning densitometer.\n\nEnd-labeled DNA 'fragments for the binding assay were prepared from pROS651 DNA after linearization of the plasmid with EcoRl and electrophoresis on a 1 O/ O agarose gel to remove any contarninating RNA. The DNA was recovered using the freeze-squeeze method of Tautz and Renz (1983) and was then digested with BamHl and Dral. End labeling using y3'P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase was as described by Maniatis et al. (1982). The binding assay was carried out essentially according to Kas and Chasin  (1987). The Mg2+ leve1 (10 mM) of the incubation buffer is important in the success of this assay (Amati and Gasser, 1988), and in these assays 10 mM MgCI2 was added to buffer D after, rather than before, centrifugation to remove insoluble material from the digitonin. About 6 x 106 LIS-extracted nuclei were incubated for 3 hr at 37OC on a rotating wheel with 10 to 20 pL of 32P-endlabeled fragments (1 x 10-l' M) and 180 units of high concentration restriction enzyme (>40 units/pL) in a total volume of 180 pL of buffer D. Sonicated pea DNA was used as the competitor in some incubations. After 3 hr, 1 mL of buffer D at 4OC was added, and the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 40009 for 1 min. The pellets were washed twice more with 1 mL of buffer D before resuspension in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl and incubation overnight with 200 pg mL-' proteinase K and 1% SDS. Wheat germ tRNA (1 pg) was added to each tube, and the samples were phenol extracted, chloroform treated, and ethanol precipitated before being electrophoresed on a 1 ?'O agarose gel in 0.04 M Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 0.001 M EDTA. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film for up to 1 week.\n\nThe 2.6-kb Hindlll-BamHI fragment of pea DNA in pROS651 was subcloned as various restriction fragments in pUC18 and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using Sequenase kits bought from United States Biochemical Corporation."
