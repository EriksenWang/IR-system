    "abstract": "Polymorphism\nof animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been shown to involve point mutations and limited length variations affecting essentially noncoding regions. In two wild mice of the European subspecies A4us mus musculus we found a mitochondrial mutant with a very large deletion in a coding region. The deletion is 5 kbp long (3 1% of the mitochondrial chromosome) and encompasses six tRNA genes and seven protein genes. The two mice were heteroplasmic: they contained a mixture of normal mtDNA and the deletion mutant. Although the latter is functionally defective, it represents 78%79% of the mtDNA molecules in our preparations from each animal.",
    "full_text": "Developments in the study of animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolution have stressed the interest in this genome as a marker in evolutionary studies at the level of species or populations (for reviews, see Avise and Lansman 1983;Boursot and Bonhomme 1986). They have also helped to describe the different types of mutations by which mtDNA can change with time. Although comparisons of the molecular organization of mtDNAs of distantly related species (e.g., mammalian species vs. Drosophila) suggest that important rearrangements of mtDNA have occurred in the course of animal evolution, such events appear to be rare, and mtDNAs of more closely related species or conspecifics differ only by point mutations and small insertions/ deletions, usually in noncoding regions (for reviews, see Brown 1983Brown , 1985;;Attardi 1985). Because the mitochondrial genome of animals has virtually no noncoding sequences, larger structural changes are likely to be deleterious and eliminated by selection. However, since the molecular mechanisms by which structural changes may occur remain unknown, it is desirable to further describe the types of changes that occur. We report here our finding, in two wild mice, of a mutant mtDNA with a very large deletion in a coding region.\n\nThe present study involves two wild mice caught simultaneously in Bulgaria in the same locality and belonging to the European subspecies Mus mus musculus. MBT, a strain newly established from Bulgarian wild M. m. musculus (Boursot et al. 1984) is used as a standard for comparison. Half of the liver, one kidney, and the spleen of each animal were separately homogenized with a motor-driven teflon homogenizer in 5 ml of 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM spermine, 0.2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.2 mM ethyleneglycol-bis-(p-amino ethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid, 0.3 M NaCl, and 0.1 M tris-(hydroxymethyl)amino methane-HCl (Tris), pH 7.4. The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 g to pellet the nuclei, and the supernatant was extracted twice with phenol and once with chloroform and then ethanol precipitated.\n\nAfter redissolution in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, the samples were treated simultaneously with RNAse A (50 pg/ml) and the appropriate restriction enzyme. Electrophoresis was carried out in 1% agarose slab gels containing 0.05% ethidium bromide. The gel used for the densitometric study was photographed under ultraviolet light with different exposure times. The strongest exposure in which the film did not appear saturated for any band was chosen for enlargement, in order to avoid extreme distortions from variations of film response to band intensities. The extent of these variations could not be estimated because of lack of suitable standards. Hue11 and HpaI digests of MBT mtDNA were used for calibration of the relationship between measured band intensities and fragment sizes (fig. 1). The response is biased but appears linear for bands >3 kb. Further measures of band intensities were corrected according to the calibration curve of figure 1. Southern blots were performed on Pall biodyne nylon membranes (BNNG) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total mtDNA probe was obtained from MBT mtDNA, purified by two cycles of CsCl-ethidium bromide density-gradient centrifugation, as described by Yonekawa et al. (1982). A partial mtDNA probe was obtained from the same purified MBT mtDNA after excision of the desired band from a low-melting-point agarose gel. Radioactive labeling of the probes with alpha 32-P dCTP was done according to the method described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (1984).\n\nIn the course of a survey of mtDNA cleavage-site polymorphism in natural populations of the house mouse subspecies Mus mus musculus in Bulgaria (Boursot et al. 1984), we found two animals showing mtDNA restriction patterns in which the fluorescence intensities of the bands were not in relative proportions vis-a-vis the sizes of the corresponding fragments. The same complex patterns were observed in both animals (fig. 2). Southern hybridization using total mtDNA as a probe confirmed that all the fragments in these digests belonged to mtDNA (fig. 6A). There can be two causes of these abnormal patterns: either some parts of the mtDNA molecule are Table 1 Comparison of the mtDNA Patterns Shown by MBT with the Abnormal Patterns for Several Restriction Enzymes Hue11 HpaI HueII-HpaI EcoRI BamHI M A M A M A M A M A 9.9 9.9 0.5 10.5 4.8 4.8 9.9 9.9 5.1 15.1 7.0\" 8.0\" 4.4a 9.2\" 10.1\" 4.3 4.3\" 3.3 3.3\" 3.6 3.6\" 4.3 4.3 1.2 1.2\" 2.1 2.1 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.6\" 2.1 2.1\" . . . . . . . . . . . . * . . . . . 2.5 2.5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.1 2.1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.7 0.7\" . . . . . . . . . . . .

It seems likely that the bands common to the two molecular forms (table 2) contain identical fragments. We get a good indication of this in the case of the HaeII 4.3-kbp and HpaI 3.3-kbp bands by examining the double digestion (fig. 3), taking advantage of the fact that the HaeII 4.3-kbp fragment contains an HpaI site and that the HpaI 3.3-kbp fragment contains an HaeII site in MBT mtDNA, as shown in figure 3 and on the restriction map of figure 5 (from Yonekawa et al. 1982). Assuming that all bands common to the two molecular forms contain identical fragments, we show in figure 5 the location of these common fragments on the physical map of mtDNA, thus excluding these parts of the molecule from being the place of the 5-kbp deletion.\n\nTable 2, together with the restriction map of figure 5, shows that, compared with the MBT map, the shorter molecular form lacks one HaeII, one EcoRI, and one HpaI site at positions 12.3, 8.0, and 7.5, respectively. The PstI digest of figure 2 suggests that the shorter form also lacks the PstI site at position 12.0 (fig. 5): this digest shows one 16.3-kbp band corresponding to the cut normal mtDNA, one stronger band cor-\n\nTable 2 Assignment of All Fragments Observed in the Abnormal Patterns to Two Molecular Forms,, One Normal and the Other 5 kb Shorter Hue11 HpaI HueII-HpaI EcoRI BamHI N S N S N S N S N S 9.9 . . . 10.5 id 4.8 . . . 9.9 15.1 . . . 7.0 'ii 4.4 9.2 10.1 4.3 4.3 3.3 3.6 3.6 4.3 1.2 1.2 2.1 . . . 2.5 . . . 2.6 2.6 2.1 2.1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.7 0.7 . . . . . . . . . . . .

Each percentage is written between the two peaks that were used in its calculation.  URFs 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, and 5 have recently been renamed NDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, and 5  (Chomyn et al. 1985).\n\n1982) and because the gene map of mtDNA is very probably identical in all mammals (Brown 1983(Brown , 1985;;Attardi 1985).\n\nTo sum up, the two mice under study are heteroplasmic and contain a mixture of two mtDNA molecular species, one normal and the other shorter. The deletion of the latter affects a 5-kbp coding region representing 3 1% of the length of the normal mtDNA molecule. It includes six tRNA genes and, totally or partially, seven protein genes (fig. 5). The deleted molecular form is stoichiometrically predominant and represents 78%79% of the mtDNA molecules in our preparations from each of the two animals.\n\nAnimal mtDNA length variations have been described between different species of Drosophila (Fauron and Wolstenholme 1976) and have since then been reported among conspecifics in a variety of species: fruit fly (Fauron and Wolstenholme 1980;Solignac et al. 1983), humans (Cann and Wilson 1983), rat (Brown and Desrosiers 1983), mouse (Fort et al. 1984), cow (Hauswirth et al. 1984), frog (Monnerot et al. 1984), lizard (Densmore et al. 1985), crickets (Harrison et al. 1985), and frog and fish (Bermingham et al. 1985). These length differences were restricted to short fragments (one basepair to a few hundred), and the longest ones affected the noncoding region surrounding the origin of replication of the heavy strand (D-loop region in vertebrates, A+T-rich region in Drosophila). Deletions/additions in other regions appeared to be extremely limited and restricted to intergenic sequences or RNA genes (for recent reviews, see Brown 1985;Attardi 1985). The case that we report is novel in that the deletion affects a very large (5-kbp) coding region of the mtDNA molecule.\n\nIn a certain number of well-studied cases of length polymorphism (Brown and Desrosiers 1983;Cann and Wilson 1983;Hauswirth et al. 1984;Densmore et al. 1985), the deletion/addition events affected regions with either repeats of a short nucleic acid sequence or homopolymers, so that a replication slippage could have been the mechanism generating insertions/deletions.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms by which other types of rearrangements of mtDNA (including the one that we describe) are generated remain unknown.\n\nThe mutant mtDNA that we found is defective for several functions: it lacks six tRNA genes and genes for subunit III of cytochrome oxidase; subunit 6 of the ATPase complex; ND 3, ND 4, and ND 4L (genes for components of the respiratory-chain NADH-dehydrogenase; Chomyn et al. 1985); and at least parts of ND 5 and of the gene for subunit II of cytochrome oxidase (see fig. 5). The translation apparatus cannot work because (1) each tRNA gene is present in single copy on the mitochondrial chromosome and (2) six of them are missing. It seems clear that, alone in a cell, the mutant would be unable to carry out the mitochondrial functions, although we cannot rule out that it might play a part in them when not alone. We therefore think that no cell in the heteroplasmic individuals contains the deleted mtDNA alone but rather that only a mixture of the two molecular forms is tolerable. Since our treatment of the samples does not involve thorough purification of the mitochondrial fraction, one might question the location of the abnormal DNA in the cells. In our experience Southern blots of mtDNA preparations similar to the present ones probed with repeated nuclear sequences showed no detectable nuclear contamination (data not shown). We therefore feel confident that the abnormal mtDNA sequence is not contained in the nucleus, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it is present in the cytoplasm outside the mitochondrion.\n\nWe are not aware of the possibility that such large amounts of DNA may be found in the cytoplasm."
