    "abstract": "To study translation initiation in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts, we mutated the initiation codon AUG to AUU, ACG, ACC, ACU, and UUC in the chloroplast petA gene, which encodes cytochrome f of the cytochrome b61f complex. Cytochrome f accumulated to detectable levels in all mutant strains except the one with a UUC codon, but only the mutant with an AUU codon grew well at 24OC under conditions that require photosynthesis. Because no cytochrome f was detectable in the UUC mutant and because each mutant that accumulated cytochrome f did so at a different level, we concluded that any residual translation probably initiates at the mutant codon. As a further demonstration that alternative initiation sites are not used in vivo, we introduced in-frame UAA stop codons immediately downstream or upstream or in place of the initiation codon. Stop codons at or downstream of the initiation codon prevented accumulation of cytochrome f , whereas the one immediately upstream of the initiation codon had no effect on the accumulation of cytochrome f. These results suggest that an AUG codon is not required to specify the site of translation initiation in chloroplasts but that the efficiency of translation initiation depends on the identity of the initiation codon.",
    "full_text": "Protein synthesis is an important target for the regulation of gene expression in chloroplasts of a variety of plant species. Although regulation of protein synthesis occurs at the level of both translation initiation and elongation, translation initiation seems to be the predominant target for regulation (Fromm et ai., 1985;Klein and Mullet, 1986;Berryet al., 1988Berryet al., ,1990;;Klein et al., 1988;Danon and Mayfield, 1991;reviewed in Gillham et al., 1994;Staub and Maliga, 1994).\n\nThe chloroplast translational machinery has many prokaryotic characteristics, including the sedimentation coefficients of ribosomes and their sensitivities to translational inhibitors. Genes encoding the chloroplast counterparts of many components of the Escherichia coli translational apparatus have been found in chloroplast and nuclear DNAs (Kostrzewa and Zetsche, 1993;Subramanian, 1993;Lin et al., 1994). Furthermore, it has been shown that Euglena chloroplast translation initiation factors can substitute to some extent for their E. coli counterparts in vitro (Gold and Spremulli, 1985;Kraus and Spremulli, 1986).\n\nDespite these similarities, significant differences exist in translation initiation between chloroplasts and prokaryotes. First, at least five chloroplast ribosomal proteins have been identified that do not have counterparts in E. coli (Subramanian, 1993). Second, in E. coli, correct initiation is facilitated by the * To whom correspondence should be addressed. interaction of the 3' end of the 16s rRNA with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5' untranslated region (UTR; Gold et ai., 1981). However, only 50% of the 196 chloroplast genes examined contain putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences in their 5'UTRs within 12 nucleotides of the initiation codon (Bonham- Smith and Bourque, 1989). In Chlamydomonas, a mutation in one such sequence in the chloroplast pefD gene @efD encodes subunit IV of the cytochrome bs/f complex) had no effect on translation initiation in vivo (Sakamoto et al., 1994), suggesting that this sequence does not function as the ribosome binding site for pefD translation. lnstead, sequence elements farther upstream in the 5'UTR are essential for translation initiation (Sakamoto et al., 1994). Genetic studies have demonstrated that the translation of severa1 chloroplast mRNAs requires gene-specific factors encoded by the nuclear genome (Kuchkaet ai., 1988; Rochaix et ai., 1989; Drapier et al., 1992;  Girard-Bascou et al., 1992). For psbA and psbC (genes encoding subunitsof photosystem li), it has been shown that the nuclear-encoded factor interacts with the 5' UTR of the transcript (Rochaix et al., 1989;Mayfield et al., 1994;Zerges and Rochaix, 1994).\n\nWe have previously used a molecular genetic approach to address the mechanism of initiation codon recognition in chloroplasts. We found that mutating the AUG initiation codon of the ChlamydomonaspefD gene to either AUU or AUC causes the translation initiation rate to decrease to 4 0 to 20% of the wild-type level, resulting in reduced photosynthetic growth at room temperature and an inability to grow photosynthetically at 35OC. These studies demonstrated that an AUG initiation codon is not an absolute requirement for translation initiation. However, it was not shown unambiguously that translation initiated at the mutant codons in these strains (Chen et al., 1993). To increase our understanding of the mechanism of initiation codon recognition in chloroplasts, we created five mutations in the initiation codon of the pefA gene, which encodes cytochrome f of the cytochrome bdf complex. Analysis of these mutants suggests that the initiation codon strongly influentes the rate of translation initiation but that the start site of translation does not specifically require an AUG codon.\n\nFive Chlamydomonas strains carrying mutations at the initiation codon position of the pefA gene were created by particle bombardment. A map of the pefA-D region of the chloroplast genome is shown at the top of Figure 1. The pefD gene and the frnR gene, which encodes tRNAArg, are located downstream of thepefA gene. Plasmids were constructed that carry changes of AUG to AUU, ACG, ACC, ACU, or UUC at the initiation codon position of the petA gene. To facilitate identification of chloroplast transformants carrying these mutations, we introduced an A-to-T change at position -4 to create an Sspl site. We also constructed a plasmid carrying this mutation alone to ensure that the phenotypes observed for the initiation codon mutant strains were not due to the -4 mutation. lntroduction of these mutations into the chloroplast genome of wild-type Chlamydomonas strain P17 was accomplished by particle bombardment with two plasmids; one contained the mutant petA gene, and the other carried a selectable marker for spectinomycin resistance encoded by the 16s rDNA. After bombardment, the cells were first selected for spectinomycin resistance and then screened for the presence of the Sspl site, which is tightly linked to the initiation codon mutations (see Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2A, a 563-bp fragment spanning the initiator region of the petA gene could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers petA4 and petA5. The PCR product from the wild-type recipient strain does not contain an Sspl site, whereas PCR products from mutant transformants can be digested with Sspl. Transformants identified in this way were at first heteroplasmic: the amplified fragments were only partially digested by Sspl, suggesting that they contained both wild-type and mutant copies of the pefA gene. Two rounds of singlecolony isolation were performed, and DNA was prepared and analyzed by PCR. Figure 2B shows the Sspl-digested PCR products from the recipient strain and the transformants; the PCR products from the transformants were completely digested by Sspl, demonstrating that they are homoplasmic. These strains were named A-AUG, A-AUU, A-ACG, A-ACC, A-ACU, and A-UUC.\n\nThe growth phenotypes of various pefA initiation codon mutants were examined on YA and HS plates, as shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Figure 1. YA plates contain acetate so that photosynthesis is not required for growth, whereas HS plates lack acetate. A strain carrying an AUG-to-AUU change at the initiation codon of the petD gene was included for comparison; this strain (D-AUU) displays a temperature-sensitive photosynthetic growth phenotype on HS medium (Chen et al., 1993). A-AUG was indistinguishable from the wild type under all growth conditions, demonstrating that the A-to-T mutation at position -4 has no effect on cell growth. A-ACC, A-ACU, and A-UUC did not grow photosynthetically at either 24OC or 35OC but did grow heterotrophically on YA medium. A-UUC was somewhat bleached when grown on YA medium; such light sensitivity is common among a variety of nonphotosynthetic mutants. At 24OC, A-ACG grew very slowly under conditions in which photosynthesis was required (the growth is not visible in Figure 3) and failed to grow on HS plates at 35OC. At 24OC on HS plates, A-AUU appeared to grow as well as the wild type, but its growth rate was reduced relative to the wild type at 35OC. An identical mutation at the pefD initiation codon caused reduced photosynthetic growth at 24OC and rapid bleaching at 35OC. Under photosynthetic conditions at (A) The strategy used to distinguish transformants carrying appropriate mutations from wild-type, untransformed cells.

In (A) and (B), numbers indicate the size of the amplified DMA fragments in base pairs. either 24°C or 35°C, A-AUU grew more robustly than did D-AUU because of higher accumulation of the cytochrome b^lf complex, as discussed later.\n\nThe photosynthetic growth phenotypes of the petA initiation codon mutants suggested that A-AUU and A-ACG were still able to produce the cytochrome /apoprotein, whereas A-ACC, A-ACU, and A-UUC produced insufficient apoprotein to support photosynthetic growth. To determine the level of cytochrome f, we performed immunoblotting experiments using cells grown in HSA (acetate-containing) medium. As shown in Figure 4A, cytochrome f accumulation was similar in the wild type and A-AUG, demonstrating that the A-to-T mutation at position -4 did not affect cytochrome f accumulation.\n\nA-AUU accumulated ~20% of the wild-type level of cytochrome f when grown in HSA. The 80% reduction in cytochrome /accumulation caused by the AUU mutation was similar to our previous observations for D-AUU, which accumulated ~10 to 20% of the wild-type level of subunit IV and was weakly photosynthetic at 24°C. A-ACG accumulated 2 to 5% of the wild-type level of cytochrome f, which probably accounts for the severely reduced photosynthetic growth of this strain. Although nonphotosynthetic, A-ACC and A-ACU still accumulated trace amounts of cytochrome f, ~1% of the wild-type level and <1% of the wild-type level, respectively. The cytochrome f apoprotein was undetectable in A-UUC. Proteins from a cytochrome /deletion strain (ApetA; Kurasand Wollman, 1994) were included in the immunoblot to show that the band detected by the antibodies in the wild-type and initiation codon mutants was indeed cytochrome /. It has been shown previously that the accumulation of cytochrome b^lf complex subunits is coordinately regulated; when cytochrome for subunit IV is limiting, accumulation of other subunits is also reduced (Lemaire et al., 1986;Chen et al., 1993). Because the accumulation of the cytochrome b^lf complex polypeptides was similar in A-AUU and D-AUU when cells were grown in HSA medium, as shown in Figure 4B, we were surprised that photosynthetic growth of A-AUU was more robust than that of D-AUU (see Figure 3). We therefore measured the accumulation of cytochrome f and subunit IV in the wild type, D-AUU, and A-AUU when grown in HS medium. Under these conditions, accumulation of both cytochrome A and subunit IV was increased in A-AUU compared with D-AUU (Figure 4B). Quantification of 125 l-protein A signals using a Phosphorlmager revealed that cytochrome /accumulation in A-AUU was approximately four times higher than that in D-AUU and corresponded to 40% of the wild-type level. The increased accumulation of the cytochrome b$lf complex in A-AUU probably accounts for its enhanced photosynthetic growth phenotype. Cytochrome /accumulation was significantly higher when A-AUU cells were grown in HS medium (two-to threefold) and modestly increased in wild-type cells but showed little if any increase in D-AUU cells. We speculate thatpetA expression is higher in minimal medium than in acetate-containing medium for all strains but that the accumulation of cytochrome / depends on the abundance of the limiting subunit(s) in the\n\nYA HS WT AUG AUU ACG WT AUG AUU ACG 24°C ACC ACU UUC AUU (petD) ACC ACU UUC AUU (petD) WT AUG AUU ACG WT AUG AUU ACG 35°C ACC ACU UUC AUU (petD) ACC ACU UUC AUU (petD) D-AUU contains AUU instead of AUG at the initiation codon position of the petD gene (Chen et al., 1993). cytochrome b 6 /f complex. In A-AUU, cytochrome / presumably limits the accumulation of the cytochrome b 6 /f complex; this is probably true as well for wild-type cells. However, in D-AUU, subunit IV presumably limits the accumulation of the cytochrome £> 6 // complex, and unassembled cytochrome f is degraded.\n\nThe increased accumulation of cytochrome /under photosynthetic growth conditions could result from increased RNA levels, an increased translation rate of petA mRNA, or increased stability of cytochrome f. We were unable to detect any difference in the levels of petA mRNA in HSA-and HS-grown wild-type, D-AUU, and A-AUU cells (data not shown). Wild-type, D-AUU, and A-AUU cells grown in HSA or HS medium and pulse labeled for 5 min with 35 S-Na 2 SO 4 did not show increased synthesis of cytochrome f in HS medium relative to other thylakoid membrane proteins, suggesting that the increase in cytochrome f accumulation did not result from increased translation (data not shown). However, because the synthesis of the other thylakoid membrane proteins may also have been affected by the growth conditions, the pulse labeling results are not fully conclusive.\n\nTo determine whether decreased cytochrome f accumulation in the initiation codon mutants is due to decreased synthesis, cells were pulse labeled with 35 S-Na 2 SO 4 for 5 min. Labeled cytochrome f was immunoprecipitated from crude cell extracts using antibodies raised against a glutathione S-transferasecytochrome f fusion protein (see Methods). We electrophoresed one-fifth of the extracts used for immunoprecipitation reactions in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to determine the amount of labeled proteins in each sample, as shown in Figure 5A. By normalizing the amount of immunoprecipitated cytochrome f to either the most prominent labeled band or the sum of all other labeled proteins, we were able to determine the relative rates of synthesis of cytochrome /in each of the petA initiation codon mutants. The results in Figure 5B show that A-AUU synthesizes cytochrome /at ~25% of the wild-type level, whereas A-ACG, A-ACC, and A-ACU synthesize cytochrome f at ~2.5, 2, and 0.8% of the wild-type level, respectively (see numbers at bottom). To ensure that the antibodies were in excess for immunoprecipitation reactions, we included a reaction in which twice the amount of extract from the wild-type cells was incubated with the same amount of antibodies used for the other reactions. Figure 5B shows that, as expected, twice as much labeled cytochrome /was immunoprecipitated, as determined by Phosphorlmager quantification.\n\nThe rates of cytochrome /synthesis are correlated with the levels of cytochrome / accumulation in petA initiation codon mutants, suggesting that decreased accumulation of cytochrome / in these mutant strains is caused by the decreased translation initiation rates of the mutant petA messages. It is remarkable that strains such as A-ACC or A-ACU, which carry two-nucleotide mutations at the initiation codon position, still synthesize detectable amounts of the cytochrome / protein.\n\nTo determine whether the decrease in cytochrome f synthesis in thepeM initiation codon mutants is correlated with decreased petA mRNA abundance, we performed RNA filter hybridizations. Figure 6 shows that petA mRNA abundance in A-AUG, A-AUU, A-ACG, A-ACC, A-ACU, and A-UUC was similar to that in the wild-type strain when normalized to atpB mRNA; this was confirmed by Phosphorlmager quantification. Therefore, decreased synthesis of cytochrome f does not result in decreased levels of petA mRNA. This contrasts with our finding that in D-AUU or D-AUC, the reduced translation rates of the\n\nCFl-p cytochrome f HSA HS subunit IV (A) Total cell extracts were prepared from cells that had been pulse labeled with ^S-NajSOA for 5 min, and proteins were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was exposed to x-ray film for 3 days. The labeled cytochrome f protein is indicated. (B) Cytochrome f was immunoprecipitated from the extracts shown in (A). Twice as much extract from the wild-type strain was included in one immunoprecipitation reaction (lane labeled 2xWT) to ensure that the cytochrome f antibodies were in excess. The amount of labeled cytochrome f was quantified using the Phosphorlmager. The labeling of cytochrome f, shown by the numbers below the gels, was normalized to the wild type using either the most prominent band or all labeled proteins in the lane, as shown in (A). Identical results were obtained from both calculations.\n\nmutant petD mRNAs destabilize them; as a result, they accumulate only to 50% of the wild-type petD mRNA level (Chen et al., 1993).\n\nThe aforementioned experiments show that most petA initiation codon mutant strains still synthesize and accumulate cytochrome f. We considered the possibility that upstream or downstream codons might serve partially or entirely as alternative initiation codons. Because cytochrome f is processed after ami no acid 31 following insertion into the thylakoid membrane, N-terminal sequencing is uninformative for determining the translation start site (Willey et al., 1984;Johnson et al., 1991;Matsumoto et al., 1991;Smith and Kohorn, 1994). However, the observation that no cytochrome f accumulates in A-UUC argues strongly against the use of alternative initiation codons. Similarly, the fact that mutants such as A-ACC and A-ACU accumulate low but different levels of cytchrome f argues that the mutated codon, rather than an alternative codon common to both strains, is utilized for translation initiation. To obtain independent evidence that an alternative codon is not used for translation initiation, we introduced UAA stop codons into three locations at or near the AUG initiation codon, as shown in Figure 7A. If cytochrome f accumulation were unaffected by a UAA codon positioned immediately upstream of the AUG codon (strain A-UAA-AUG), we could conclude that upstream codons do not contribute significantly to translation initiation. Using similar reasoning, we introduced a UAA codon immediately downstream of AUG (strain A-AUG/UAA) to determine whether any codon downstream of the second codon can serve as the initiation codon. To exclude the possibility that the second codon serves as the initiation codon, we introduced a UAA mutation at the initiation codon position (strain A-UAA). Sspl sites tightly linked to these mutations were created by introducing additional AA-to-TT (-5 and -4 positions for A-UAA/AUG) or A-to-T (-4 position for A-AUG/UAA and A-UAA) changes. These strains were created by chloroplast transformation, as described for the initiation codon mutant strains. The accumulation of cytochrome f in stop codon mutant strains was determined by immunoblotting. Figure 7B shows that no cytochrome / was detected in A-AUG/UAA, suggesting that codons downstream of the second codon do not serve as initiation codons in vivo. Furthermore, no cytochrome f was detected in A-UAA, suggesting that the second codon does not serve as the initiation codon in vivo. In A-UAA/AUG, cytochrome f accumulated to the wild-type level, suggesting that initiation upstream of the AUG codon does not contribute significantly to cytochrome f accumulation. These results, taken together with the data shown in Figure 4, suggest that the use of an alternative petA initiation codon is minimal or nonexistent in vivo. RNA was separated in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with probes for petA and afpfi. The latter probe was used to normalize the amount of RNA loaded in each lane. WT, wild type.\n\nWe have shown previously that strains in which the Chlamydomonas chloroplast petD initiation codon AUG was changed to either AUU or AUC retained the ability to translate subunit IV at 10 to 20% of the wild-type level (Chen et al., 1993). We have now made both one-and two-nucleotide mutations in the initiation codon of a second chloroplast gene, the petA gene, and demonstrated that most of the mutations examined do not abolish translation. This suggests that at least two and perhaps all chloroplast genes can tolerate mutations in their initiation codons. The failure to accumulate cytochrome f in A-UUC and the results from the stop codon strains argue that alternative initation codons are not used in vivo. This strongly suggests that in each initiation codon mutant strain that accumulates cytochrome f, the mutant codon is used as the initiation codon. Thus, the petA initiation codon AUG seems to dictate only the efficiency of translation initiation rather than specifying the site of translation initiation. Although AUG is nearly universally used as an initiation codon in chloroplast genes, C. reinhardtii and C. eugametos psbC genes (and possibly those of land plants) appear to use GUG as their initiation codon (Rochaix et al., 1989;Turmel et al., 1993).\n\nIn experiments to be reported elsewhere, we found that mutations immediately upstream of the initiation codon position in A-AUU had a strong effect on cytochrome f accumulation. In particular, changing the initiation region from AUUAUU (where the initiation codon is underlined) to UAAAUU abolished cytochrome f accumulation. We believe that this probably results from an impaired interaction between the 16S rRNA and petA mRNA in the context of a weak initiation codon rather than preventing the use of an alternative upstream initiation site. As mentioned previously, the latter possibility is inconsistent with the low but codon-specific levels of cytochrome f in A-ACG, A-ACC, and A-ACU and the observation that A-UUC does not accumulate any detectable cytochrome f.\n\nOur analysis of the petA initiation codon mutants allows us to draw certain conclusions regarding the tolerance of non-AUG initiation codons. Two single-nucleotide mutations, AUG to AUU or ACG, decreased translation to ~20% and 2 to 5% of the wild-type level, respectively. The two-nucleotide mutations, AUG to ACC or ACU, caused translation to decrease to 1 to 2% and 0.8% of the wild-type level, respectively. The two-nucleotide mutation UUC, which changed the first and the third nucleotides of the initiation codon, abolished translation initiation. The phenotypes of these mutants suggest that (1) single-nucleotide mutations at the third position are tolerated more easily than those at the second position; (2) singlenucleotide mutations are tolerated more easily than twonucleotide mutations; and (3) mutations in the first position are more deleterious than those at the second position.\n\nThe relatively high tolerance of third position changes in the initiation codon is consistent with the wobble rule for the interactions between codons and anticodons. In mature initiation complexes in prokaryotes, the (Met-tRNA interacts with the initiation codon using its anticodon 3'-UAC-5'. The role of fMet-tRNA in the formation of the 308 initiation complex has long been the subject of debate (Gold et al., 1981). The currently favored model for 30S initiation complex formation in prokaryotes is that the 308 ribosomal subunit binds to either the fMet-tRNA or the mRNA in a random order, suggesting that fMet-tRNA has at most a minor role in initiation codon selection during translation initiation (Gold et al., 1981). Indeed, recent cross-linking data suggest that mRNA-rRNA contacts occur over an extensive region surrounding the initiation codon to position the ribosome correctly (reviewed in McCarthy and Brimacombe, 1994). However, the relative translation rates in the petA initiation codon mutants can be explained roughly by the strength of the potential base-pairing interaction between the fMet-tRNA anticodon and the mutant codons. This suggests that the strength of codon-anticodon interactions may determine the rates of translation initiation. Because the mutant codons are probably used as the initiation codon rather than a nearby codon that might have a stronger base-pairing interaction with the fMet-tRNA (for example, in the A-UUC strain, the immediate upstream codon is AUU), fMet-tRNA does not appear to determine the site of translation initiation. Instead, it appears only to facilitate initiation from a site whose location is determined by other factors.\n\nBecause neither the AUG initiation codon nor the fMet-tRNA appears to determine the start site of translation in chloroplasts, this site must be specified by other factors. The available experimental evidence suggests that for the barley large subunit of ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and the ChlamydomonaspsbA genes, a prokaryotic mechanism is used for translation initiation, baséd on in vitro binding studies in the former instance or site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo analysis of chloroplast transformants in the latter (Kim and Mullet, 1994;Mayfield et al., 1994). Although a number of Chlamydomonas chloroplast mRNAs contain Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence motifs and the 3' end of the Chlamydomonas 16s rRNA contains complementary sequences in the expected location (Dron et al., 1982), many chloroplast mRNAs do not have a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence at positions -5 to -10. When a candidate Shine-Dalgarno sequence was mutated in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast petD gene, no effect on translation initiation was observed (Sakamoto et al., 1994).\n\nTwo possible mechanisms that translate mRNAs lacking obvious Shine-Dalgarno elements at positions -5 to -10 are the following: (1) the 30s subunit recognizes a Shine-Dalgarno sequence farther upstream and then scans to the start site, as has been proposed for barleypsbA (Kim and Mullet, 1994);and (2) an unrelated sequence element serves as a protein or rRNA binding site, which might mediate the mRNA-30s ribosomal subunit interaction. Such sequences might be located in the 5' UTR close to the initiation site. For example, a nine-nucleotide sequence (3WGGCGCCGA-53, which is present in a single-stranded region of the small ribosomal rRNAs termed the 530 loop, has been implicated in regulating translation initiation by interacting with the three nucleotides immediately upstream of the initiation codon (Lagúnez-Otero, 1993). Other sequences likely to be involved in chloroplast translation initiation lie farther upstream, such as those identified for psbA, psbC, and petD mRNAs in Chlamydomonas (Rochaix et al., 1989;Mayfield et al., 1994;Sakamoto et al., 1994).\n\nConstruction of petA Transforming Plasmids pHcRV1.6 contains a 1.6-kb Hincll-EcoRV subfragment of BamHl fragment 7 of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome (Harris, 1989). It contains the entirepetA gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pHcRV1.6 according to Kunkel (1985) to produce nine mutations at or near the initiation codon position, as shown in Figures 1 and 7. The following primers were used for mutagenesis: petA6, TAC-3: which was used to create the A-AUG, A-AUU, A-ACG, A-ACC, A-ACU, and A-UUC mutants; petAll, 5\"GTTTCGTTTTAAGATTAATAAT- ATTTAATCTAACCAAGTATTTAC-3: which was used to create the A-UAA mutant; petA12,5'-GTTTCGTTTTAAGATTAATATTTAAAT(G/T)TClAA- CCAAGTATTTAC-3: which was used to create the A-UAA/AUG mutant; petAl3, 5'-GTTTCGTTTTAAGATTAATAATATTAT(G/T)TAAAACCAAGT- ATTTAClAC-3: which was used to create mutant A-AUGIUAA. The petA6, petAll, and petAl2 primers correspond to nucleotides -25 to +20 with respect to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of the petA gene. The petAl3 primer corresponds to nucleotides -25 to +23 with respect to the initiation codon. Following mutagenesis, larger plasmids carrying these mutations, the pBRV3.8 series, were obtained by replacing the Hincll-EcoRV fragment from the wild-type pBRV3.8 plasmid, which contains a 3.8-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment, with the mutant Hincll-EcoRV fragments (Figure 1).\n\n5'-GTTTCGTTTTAAGATTAATAATATTA(T/C)(G/T/C)TCTAACCAAGTATT-Chlamydomonas Strains, Culture Conditions, and Chloroplast Transformation\n\nThe ApetA strain, which contains a deletion in the coding region of thepet4 gene, was kindly provided by F. -A. Wollman (Institut de Biolcgie Physico-Chimique, Paris; Kuras and Wollman, 1994). P17 (Stern et al., 1991) is a wild-type Chlamydomonas strain derived from CC373 (ac-uc-2-21; Shepherd et al., 1979) by bombardment with the atpB gene and was used as the recipient strain to create the petA mutant strains.\n\nChlamydomonas strains were grown in YA, HSA, or HS medium (Harris, 1989) under continuous medium-intensity light (5 to 8 WM). YA and HSA media contain acetate and support nonphotosynthetic growth. HS medium lacks acetate, and cells require photosynthesis for growth.\n\npetA initiation codon mutations were introduced into the chloroplast genome by cotransformation (Kindle et al., 1991) with the pCrBH4.8 (spectinomycin-resistant) plasmid. A 2:l ratio of petA DNA (the pBRV3.8 series) to pCrBH4.8 was used, and the petA pBRV3.8 plasmids were linearized with BamHl to increase cotransformation efficiency.\n\nApproximately 104 cells were scraped from a plate and resuspended in 100 pL of proteinase K buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCI). SDS was added to a final concentration of 2.50/0, and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 200 pg/mL. The samples were incubated at 55OC for 1 hr and extracted with phenolchloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was dissolved in 15 pL of H20, and 5 pL was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nThe positions of the primers petA4 and petA5, which were used for screening transformants, are shown in Figure 2A. Their sequences are as follows: petA4, S'-GCTAGAATAAACTTGTTGAGGC-3; corresponding to nucleotides -197 to -175 with respect to the initiation codon, and petA5.5'4TGCCGGAACGCGATCTGG-3: corresponding to nucleotides +348 to +366.\n\nPCR was performed in a volume of 50 pL using 1.5 mM MgCI2, 40 pM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 200 ng of each primer, and two units of Promega Taq polymerase for each reaction. Thirty cycles of amplification were performed at an annealing temperature of 55OC and a polymerization temperature of 72OC.\n\nProtein preparation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (Chen et al., 1993). Antibodies raised against spinach CFl-p (p subunit of the chloroplast ATPase) were obtained from R. McCarty (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and used at a 1:100,000 dilution. To raise antibodies against Chlamydomonas cytochrome f, a HindlllAccl fragment from the coding region of the petA gene was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and inserted into the Smal site of the fusion protein vector pGEX-Z, which generates glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (Smith and Johnson, 1988). E. colicells were induced with 0.15 mM isopropyl P-o-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 hr, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded into preparative 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The induced fusion protein band was excised from the gel, electroeluted, and quantified by SDS-PAGE using BSA as a standard. Fusion protein (120 pg) was initially injected into a rabbit, followed by two boosts of 50 pg each. The crude serum was tested by immunoblotting on filters containing total proteins from wild-type and ApetA strains. The crude serum reacted with a prominent protein of the expected size in the wild-type strain but not in the ApetA strain; two very faint additional signals were present in both strains. lmmunoblots were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of the crude serum. After incubation with the antiserum, the blots were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, and the signals were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit from Amersham. For some experiments, lZ51-protein A was used instead of the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. The signals were quartified using a Phosphorlmager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nCells were grown to mid-log phase in HSA medium. RNA was isolated and filter hybridizations were performed as described previously (Stern et al.. 1991). RNA accumulation was quantified using a Phosphorlmager. The atpB probe was a PCR product amplified from the plasmid p17 using primers DBS2 and NSlb. DBS2,5'-GACC(?TATACAAGAGCTAC-3; corresponds to nucleotides -454 to -470 relative to the initiation codon of a416. NSlb, 5GACCGTATACAAGAGCTAC-3; mrresponds to nuclee tides 1471 to 1453 relative to the initiation codon of atp6. The petA probe was a Hindlll-Pvull fragment located in the coding region.\n\nChlamydomonas cells were labeled for 5 min with 35S-Na2S04 in the presence of cycloheximide, as described by Sakamoto et al. (1994) After labeling, cells were washed in 1 mL of 50 mM sodium-Tricine containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mM E-amino-n-caproic acid, 50 pglmL aprotinin, and 1 mM EDTA. Cells were then resuspended in 100 pL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8,2% SDS, 5% P-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 2 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,0009 in a microcentrifuge for 3 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was diluted 20-fold with dilution buffer (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM e-amino-n-caproic acid, and 1 mM benzamidine in TBS 10.5 M NaCI, 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.51). Five microliters of preimmune serum was added to the lysate and incubated at 4OC for 1 hr. Fifty microliters of Staphylococcus aureus cells washed with the dilution buffer lacking the protease inhibitors was then added, and incubation was continued for 30 min. The cells were collected in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Five microliters of cytochrome f antibodies were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated on a rocking platform at 4OC overnight. Fifty microliters of S. aureus cells was then added to the mixture, and incubation was continued for 30 min. The cells were then collected in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was washed with the following buffers: 1 mL of dilution buffer without protease inhibitors for two washes. followed by 1 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5/0.1% Nonidet P-40 for the third wash. The cells were resuspended in 20 pL of 1.5 x SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min. and loaded into 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gels. One-fifth of the amount of extract used for immune precipitation was electrophoresed to quantify total labeled proteins."
