    "abstract": "To understand the mineralogical association, concentration, and distribution of arsenic (As) in the Hawthorn Group, the chemical and mineralogical composition of 362 samples that were collected from 16 cores in southwestern Florida were examined in detail. In the study area, the Hawthorn Group consisted primarily of a basal carbonate unit (the Arcadia Formation) and an upper siliciclastic unit (The Peace River Formation). The Peace River Formation contains appreciable amounts of phosphate and is currently being exploited for phosphate ore. Samples were taken from cores of each formation at intervals of 7.5 m. In addition, to the interval samples, sections likely to have high As concentrations, such as zones with pyrite crystals, hydrous ferric oxides, green clays, and organic material, were collected and analyzed. Bulk As concentrations were determined by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) after digestion with aqua regia (3:1 HCl and HNO 3 ). The elements Fe, Al, Si, Mg, Ca, S, and P were measured on the same solutions by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The identification of discrete minerals was aided by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and chemical compositions within the sample matrix and in individual minerals were obtained by electron-probe microanalysis (EMPA).\nThis detailed mineralogical and geochemical study demonstrated that: (1) As in the Hawthorn Group varied from formation to formation and was mostly concentrated in trace minerals, such as pyrite; (2) average As concentrations significantly changed from 8.8 mg/kg (r = 8.6 mg/kg) in the Peace River Formation to 3.0 mg/kg (r = 3.7 mg/kg) in the Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation. Arsenic concentrations for all Hawthorn samples varied from 0.1 to 69.0 mg/kg; (3) pyrite, with one exception, occurred as framboids and was unevenly distributed throughout the Hawthorn Group; (4) pyrite framboids were located inside a francolite (carbonate fluorapatite) matrix with As concentrations as high as 3730 mg/kg and as a trace mineral in the sediment matrix concentrations varying from <1 to 8260 mg/kg; (5) hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) contained As concentrations as high as 540 mg/kg; (6) francolite, organic material, and clays contained substantially less As than pyrite; (7) thus, the release of As from pyrite could pose a potential problem for the phosphate industry.",
    "full_text": "Southwestern Florida hosts several large phosphate mines that exploit the Oligocene-to Mioceneaged Hawthorn Group sediments (Blakey, 1973). Currently, Florida supplies about one-quarter of the world's and three-quarters of the United States domestic phosphate needs (Hodges et al., 2001).\n\nArsenic concentrations of up to 54.1 mg/kg were recently reported for samples from the Oligoceneaged Suwannee Limestone in Florida (Price and Pichler, 2006). The Suwannee Limestone directly underlies the Hawthorn Group, which triggered this study. Because P and As are chemically closely related, they often co-occur in nature (Shields, 2002). In addition, the highly open crystal structure of carbonate fluorapatite (francolite) shows a tendency to accumulate such elements as As, Mo, Se, Y, Zn and the Rare Earth Elements (REE) during diagenesis (Shields, 2002). This may pose problems for phosphate mining, such as (1) high As values in the phosphate-bearing rock has a negative effect on ore processing (benefication) and the quality of the final product; and (2) mine-induced changes in ground water physico-chemical conditions may cause the release of As present in the subsurface, Fig. 1. Map of the research area including the Regional Observation Monitor Well Program (ROMP) locations, numbers, and names of the 16 cores that were sampled. Note: the sample labels correspond to drill 'well number' -'sample depth '. causing increased values in public and private supply wells relative to existing drinking water standards. The potential for this scenario was clearly demonstrated by release of high-As water from Coronet Industries processing plant in Plant City, Hillsborough County, where levels were in excess of 100 lg/L (Hammett, 2002). The new Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for As in drinking water, established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in 2001 and which took effect on January 23, 2006, is 10 lg/L (Walsh, 2001). Moreover, there have been several occurrences of swine fatalities due to As contaminated phosphate feed supplements (El Bahri and Romdane, 1991).\n\nThe research area is located in the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) between Tampa and Port Charlotte (Fig. 1). Here the hydrogeological framework can be subdivided into 3 discrete units, the Floridan Aquifer System (FAS), the Intermediate Aquifer System (IAS) or Intermediate Confining Unit, and the Surficial Aquifer System (SAS) (Fig. 2) (Miller, 1986).\n\nThe Miocene Hawthorn Group is the stratigraphic unit that contains the Intermediate aquifer system. It is subdivided into a lower section comprising the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation, Tampa and Nocatee Members of the Arcadia Formation (Fig. 2) and the upper section of the Peace River Formation (Scott, 1988(Scott, , 1990)). The Arcadia Formation unconformably overlies the Oligocene Suwannee Limestone. Its maximum thickness within the study area is approximately 183 m (600 ft) in the Okeechobee Basin (Scott, 1988). Throughout the research area the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation is principally composed of variable amount of siliciclastics Fig. 2. Lithostratigraphic and hydrogeologic units of the study area (Modified from Miller, 1986). such as quartz sands, greenish gray clays, chert and francolite within a carbonate matrix (Scott, 1990). The lithology of the Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation varies from yellow-gray marine wackestone to packestone containing variable amounts of dolostone, clay, quartz sand and minor occurrences of francolite (Wingard et al., 1993;Scott, 1988). The Nocatee Member forms the base of the Arcadia Formation (Fig. 2) in the much of the southern portion of SWFWMD. Scott (1988) reported that the Nocatee Member contains the highest amount of siliciclastic material found within the entire Arcadia Formation.\n\nThe Peace River Formation, currently being exploited for the phosphate ore, unconformably overlies the Arcadia Formation (Fig. 2) and, within the study area, reaches a maximum thickness of 46-61 m (150-200 ft) in the Okeechobee Basin (Scott, 1990). In the study area, the Peace River Formation consists of greenish gray sandy clays, and carbonates with variable amounts of francolite, sand and gravel (Green et al., 1995). The carbonates are comprised of interbedded limestones, dolostones, and a siliciclastic component dominates the Peace River Formation (Scott, 1988).\n\nA combination of petrographic and geochemical techniques was used to evaluate the abundance and mineralogical association of As in 362 samples from 16 Hawthorn Group cores in proximity to current and future phosphate mining. The cores were originally collected as part of the Regional Observation Monitor Well Program (ROMP) by SWFWMD, and stored at the Florida Geological Survey (FGS) in Tallahassee. Each core was sampled at an even spacing of approximately 7.5 m to ensure representation of the entire Hawthorn interval. In addition, targeted samples were taken from sections, which previous studies (Price and Pichler, 2006) suggested were likely to have higher As concentrations than the bulk carbonate/siliciclastic matrix, such as areas containing visible pyrite, hydrous ferric oxides, green clays, and organic material. Overall, 285 interval samples and 77 targeted samples were collected and analyzed. The sample labels correspond to drill 'well number' -'sample depth' (for example, sample 12-48).\n\nThe samples were initially examined using a 10• hand lens and a stereo microscope. Based on a combination of hand specimen description and bulk As concentration (following chemical analyses), approximately 60 samples were selected for further study. Polished thin sections were made for those samples and they were examined using a polarizing microscope with reflected and transmitted light.\n\nTo determine bulk chemical composition samples were powdered (homogenized) in an agate mortar. To avoid cross-contamination, the mortar and pestle were cleaned with pure silica sand and deionised water between samples. A dilute HNO 3 solution was used after powdering soft greenish clays. Approximately 0.5 ± 0.001 g of powdered sample was weighed into a digestion vessel and 10 mL of a 3:1 mixture of HCl and HNO 3 was added. The digestion vessel was immediately capped with a reflux cup to trap any arsine gas. The sample was heated to a temperature of 95 °C for 30 min. After digestion, the solution was cooled, diluted to 50 mL (5:1) with DI water, centrifuged for 15 min to remove non-soluble particles, and filtered.\n\nCalcium, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, P, Si and Al were determined on a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000 DV inductively coupled plasma -optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Bulk As concentrations were measured by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry using a PSA 10.055 Millenium Excalibur instrument (HG-AFS) at the Center for Water Analysis, University of South Florida. The accuracy and precision of the measurements and acid digestion was verified by analysis of the JGS JLs-1 reference material and sample duplicates, which indicated a precision of better than 5%. Reagent-acid blanks were tested and showed no detectable As. Background signal drift was consistently less than 1%.\n\nBased on the bulk concentrations, samples with high As levels were selected for a more focused mineralogical analysis using a Hitachi S-3500N scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the College of Marine Science, University of South Florida.\n\nTo better understand the chemical composition of individual minerals and mineral phases containing As, 16 polished thin sections from each formation/member of the Hawthorn Group were chosen for electron-probe microanalysis -wave dispersive spectrometry (EMPA or electron microprobe), using a JEOL 8200 instrument at the University of New Mexico. Operating conditions of the electron microprobe were 20 kV accelerating voltage, a spot size of 5 lm, and a 20 nA current. The electron microprobe was used for spot analysis and to map As concentrations within the sample matrix and in individual minerals.\n\nMost samples consisted of carbonate material (limestones and dolostones), with a variable siliciclastic component, and francolite. The siliciclastics were primarily composed of gray and grayish green clays, and quartz. The Tampa Member contained minor or no francolite. The sedimentary components contained minor mineral phases, such as pyrite, gypsum, chert, secondary calcite, feldspar, and hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs). The HFOs were frequently observed as stains or rings around pyrites. Framboidal pyrite was ubiquitous throughout the Arcadia Formation. Organic matter was observed in several samples and revealed a heterogeneous distribution throughout the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation.\n\nThe examination of thin sections confirmed the presence of francolite, calcite, dolomite, feldspar, pyrite, quartz, clays, and HFO. Pyrite was present as framboids generally less 10 lm in diameter in about 90% of the thin sections, occurring in the sediment matrix and as inclusions in francolite nodules (Fig. 3). Framboids consisted of euhedral pyrite micro-crystals. These observations were confirmed by SEM (Fig. 4a).\n\nThe majority of samples from the Peace River sediments were composed of siliciclastics such as quartz sand, gray to dark greenish gray clays, and substantial amounts of francolite. Minor mineral phases were pyrite, gypsum, sulfur, secondary calcite, feldspar, and HFO. Most pyrite was present in the form of framboids; cubic pyrite (Fig. 4b) only occurred in one sample (12-125(2)).\n\nThin section examination confirmed the presence of pyrite, francolite, calcite, gypsum, dolomite, feldspar, quartz, clays and HFO. About 90% of the thin sections from the Peace River Formation contained pyrite crystals in the sediment matrix and several samples revealed pyrite inclusions in francolite grains and calcite crystals (Fig. 5).\n\nBulk As concentrations for all 362 Hawthorn Group samples varied from 0.1 to as high as 69.0 mg/kg with a mean (l) of 5.6 mg/kg (r = 7.1 mg/kg) (Table 1). Bulk-rock chemical anal-yses by ICP-OES for Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, S, Al, P and Si showed that the strongest linear correlation for the Hawthorn Group sediments existed between S and Fe with a R 2 of 0.87 (Appendix 1), which could be due to the outlier effect (Swan and Sandilands, 1995) caused by sample 12-125(2) (Fig. 6a). This sample had anomalously high Fe, S and P compared to other Hawthorn Group sediments. Elimination of the outlier point changed the correlation coefficient to R 2 = 0.77 (Fig. 6b).\n\nThe total As concentrations of the 285 interval samples (samples that were taken at fixed intervals) ranged from 0.1 to 40.8 mg/kg with a mean of 5.0 mg/kg (r = 5.8 mg/kg) (Table 1). Bulk-rock analyses by ICP-OES revealed a significant degree of linear correlation between Fe and S (R 2 = 0.69) for all interval samples (Fig. 7, Appendix 1).\n\nThe bulk As concentrations of the 77 targeted samples (samples likely to have high As concentrations) ranged from 0.4 to 69.0 mg/kg with a mean of 8.3 mg/kg (r = 10.5 mg/kg) (Table 1). Bulk-rock analysis showed that a significant degree of linear correlation existed between Fe and S (R 2 = 0.95) for the all ''special interest'' samples (Appendix 1), which could be due to the outlier effect (Swan and Sandilands, 1995) caused by sample 12-125(2) (Fig. 8a). Elimination of the outlier point reduced the correlation coefficient to R 2 = 0.83 (Fig. 8b).\n\nThe bulk As concentrations in samples from the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation varied from 0.1 to 36.0 mg/kg with a mean of 5.7 mg/kg (r = 6.2 mg/kg) (Table 1). Approximately 88% and 11% of the samples had <10 mg/kg and <1 mg/kg As, respectively. Samples consisting mainly of limestone and dolostone showed low As concentrations, whereas higher concentrations were generally associated with pyrite, clay, HFO and francolite. A high degree of linear correlation for the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation sediments existed for S with Fe (R 2 = 0.81), and Al with Fe (R 2 = 0.74) (Appendix 1).\n\nThe bulk As concentrations in samples from the Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation ranged from 0.2 to 15.2 mg/kg (Table 1). The mean value for 75 samples was 3 mg/kg (r = 3.7 mg/kg). Approximately 92% and 39% of the samples contained <10 mg/kg and <1 mg/kg As, respectively. A high degree of linear correlation for the Tampa Member samples existed for Al with Fe (R 2 = 0.76), and Al with S (R 2 = 0.78). The most significant linear correlation for As in the Tampa Member sediments existed with S (R 2 = 0.61) (Fig. 9, Appendix 1).\n\nThe bulk As concentrations in sediments from the Nocatee Member of the Arcadia Formation ranged from 0.5 to as high as 69.0 mg/kg (Table 1). The mean value for 27 samples was 6.5 mg/kg (r = 13.1 mg/kg). Approximately 88% of the samples contained less than 10 mg/kg As and roughly 22% less than 1 mg/kg. The sample 12-529 from the Nocatee Member was composed of greenish clay with a significant amount of pyrite (framboids) and represented the highest As concentration (69.0 mg/ kg) of all Hawthorn Group samples. A high degree of linear correlation for the Nocatee Member sediments existed for Fe with S (R 2 = 0.85), and Fe with Al (R 2 = 0.81) (Appendix 1).\n\nThe total As concentrations in samples from the Peace River Formation ranged from 0.4 to 40.8 mg/ kg (Table 1). Mean value for 54 samples was 8.8 mg/kg (r = 8.6 mg/kg). Approximately 70% of the samples had As concentrations less than 10 mg/kg and about 7% less than 1 mg/kg (Appendix 2). Samples consisting mostly of pure carbonates or sandstone with no visible trace minerals had low concentrations of As. Generally, high As concentrations occurred with pyrite, clay, HFO, and francolite.\n\nThe strongest linear correlation for the Peace Formation sediments existed between Fe and S (R 2 = 0.94) (Appendix 1), which could be due to the outlier effect caused by sample 12-125(2). Removing the outlier from the plot resulted in a significantly lower degree of linear correlation (R 2 = 0.59). This is because analyzed samples contained not only pyrite, but also contained HFO and gypsum, sources of Fe and S.\n\nAfter determination of bulk As concentrations samples with high As were selected for a more detailed geochemical and mineralogical investigation. The electron-probe (EMPA) analysis of 16 thin sections with variations in lithologic compositions revealed that substantial As concentrations were present only in pyrite. About 126 pyrite framboids were analyzed for As and concentrations ranged from <1 to 8260 mg/kg with a mean of 1272 mg/kg (r = 1379 mg/kg) (Table 2). Prior studies of framboidal pyrite in the Suwannee Limestone, which underlies the Hawthorn Group, demonstrated a similar As enrichment in pyrite, ranging from 100 to 11 200 mg/kg (Price and Pichler, 2006).  The elemental maps of clays, pyrite, dolomite, quartz and francolite demonstrated that high concentrations of As were generally associated with pyrite and sometimes with HFO. The elemental map of a francolite nodule (sample 5-1-235, undifferentiated Arcadia Formation) revealed the presence of very small pyrite crystals (<5 lm) inside the nodule (Fig. 10). Arsenic values in these pyrites were up to 3700 mg/kg while As values in the phosphate matrix were <1 mg/kg. The elemental mapping of sample 4-1-501 from the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation demonstrated As enrichment in both pyrites and HFO, and showed a heterogeneous distribution of As. R 2 = 0.69 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 Fe (mg/kg) S (mg/kg) Fig. 7. Correlation between Fe and S (in bold) for the Hawthorn Group interval samples (n = 285).\n\nThe EMPA mapping of sample 12-125 from the Peace River Formation clearly showed the concentration of As in pyrite, compared to clay and phosphate materials (Figs. 11 and 12). For the bulk-rock analysis, sample 12-125 was divided into two parts due to its heterogeneity. Total As for sample 12-125(1) was 8.1 mg/kg and 26.7 mg/kg for 12-125(2) (Appendix 2). Sample 12-125(2) possibly represented a burrow fill with a significant amount of pyrite in the phosphate matrix.\n\nThe electron microprobe analysis of 31 pyrites in sample 22-170 (Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation) clearly illustrated the large range of As concentrations over a small area. Values ranged from 10 to 2180 mg/kg. These results confirmed the extremely heterogeneous distribution of As not only between pyrite and other Hawthorn Group minerals, but also within pyrites themselves.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to examine: (1) mineralogical association, (2) concentration, and (3) distribution of As in the Miocene Hawthorn Group in southwestern Florida. This research is essential for the planning of phosphate mining operations and forecasting As behavior in the subsurface during anthropogenic induced physico-chemical changes in the aquifer.\n\nArsenic occurred throughout the entire Hawthorn Group and concentrations varied drastically from formation to formation (Table 1). The distribution of As mean values for the each formation and member of the Hawthorn Group showed a decrease of As concentration with depth (Fig. 13). The same distribution patterns occurred for Fe, S, Al, and P (Fig. 14). According to Scott (1988), the siliciclastic components, such as clay, francolite, and quartz sand are dominant in the Peace River Formation and their role in the Hawthorn Group decreases with depth. Therefore, the overall decrease of As concentrations with depth correlated to the siliciclastic content. Only the Nocatee Member of the Arcadia Formation revealed a higher mean As concentration, which could be due to the outlier effect (Swan and Sandilands, 1995) caused by sample 12-529, which had the highest As concentration of all Hawthorn Group samples (69 mg/kg) (Fig. 13a). Elimination of the outlier resulted in a lower As mean value (4.1 mg/kg) for the Nocatee Member (Fig. 13b). The higher contribution of siliciclastic material in the Nocatee Member (Scott, 1988) demonstrated the elevated values of Fe, S, Al and P compared to those in the Tampa Member (Fig. 14).\n\nThere are four major potential sources of As in the Hawthorn Group sediments: R 2 = 0.62 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 0 5 10 15 20 As (mg/kg) S (mg/kg) Fig. 9. Correlation between As and S for the Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation.\n\n(1) Substitution at any of the fluorapatite sites in francolite;\n\n(2) Substitution in the crystal structure of sulfide minerals, such as pyrite and arsenopyrite;\n\n(3) Adsorption or ion exchange onto clay and organic matter; (4) Adsorption or coprecipitation with HFO.\n\nThe highly open crystal structure of francolite permits substitution at any of the fluorapatite sites, e.g. Na + , Mg 2+ , Sr 2+ for Ca 2+ ; OH À , AsO 3À , CrO 2À , VO 3À for PO 3À 4 ; and Cl À , Br À for F À (Shields, 2002). According to Smedley and Kinniburgh (2002), Ca phosphate or apatite can contain up to 1000 mg/kg As. On the other hand, Stow (1969) did not report any correlation between As and P in the Bone Valley Member of the Hawthorn Group. The combination of the ICP-OES and HG-AFS showed no correlation between As and P. However, the EMPA elemental mapping of the internal chemical composition of the francolite nodule from the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation revealed the occurrence of pyrite inclusions with As enrichment as high as 3700 mg/kg compared to phosphate matrix with As of <1 m/kg (Fig. 10).\n\nDetailed lithologic examinations of the Hawthorn Group sediments with a stereo and scanning electron microscope revealed the existence of unevenly distributed pyrite occurring mostly with greenish clays, francolite and organic material. The majority of pyrite in the Hawthorn Group samples was present in the form of framboids, cubic pyrite only occurred in one sample (Fig. 4b). According to Ohfuji and Rickard (2005) framboidal pyrite is a microscopic spheroidal to sub-spheroidal aggregate with an internal microcrystalline structure and a distinctive raspberry-like shape. Price and Pichler (2006) reported that pyrite in the Suwannee Limestone, which directly underlies the Hawthorn Group sediments, was mostly present as pseudoframboids, or framboid-shaped pyrite aggregates. Massive internal structure of pseudo-framboidal pyrite is composed of interlocking granular or acicular pyrite microcrystals (Ohfuji and Rickard, 2005;Wang and Morse, 1996).\n\nExamination of thin sections with the polarizing microscope demonstrated that framboidal pyrites occurred in about 90% of all samples as a trace mineral in the sediment matrix and as inclusions in francolite grains and calcite crystals. Prior studies of sulfide minerals such as the abundance and occurrence of pyrite in the Suwannee Limestone (Price and Pichler, 2006) revealed significant enrichment of As in pyrite with concentrations as high as 11 200 mg/kg. Thomas and Saunders (1998) reported As concentrations in pyrite framboids of up to 1000 mg/kg as a substitute element for S in the FeS 2 structure. Huerta-Diaz and Morse (1990Morse ( , 1992) ) found As concentrations in marine sedimentary pyrites of up to 9300 mg/kg. Therefore, sedimentary pyrite can be a significant sink and potential source of As.\n\nThe ICP-OES results revealed a strong linear correlation between S and Fe (R 2 = 0.87) confirming the presence of pyrite (Fig. 6). Lack of a significant correlation between As and S or Fe was probably due to the contribution of As from other sources, such as clays, HFO, francolite, or organic matter. The electron microprobe analyses of 16 thin sections with variations in lithologic composition revealed that substantial As concentrations were present in pyrite. Arsenic concentrations in 126 analyzed pyrites ranged from <1 to as high as 8260 mg/kg showing the heterogeneous distribution of As (Table 2).\n\nClay minerals readily adsorb As because of the oxide-like character of the edges of their crystals (Goldberg, 2002). The lithologic examination of the Hawthorn Group sediments revealed the abundance of green or brownish green clays mostly in the Peace River Formation. Generally, green clays contained unevenly distributed pyrite and francolite. The HG-AFS analyses of clays generally showed high As concentrations. Organic matter has a very small particle size, which, therefore, results in a large surface area per unit volume and ability to adsorb As. Moreover the potential of organic material to generate complexes with heavy metals is due to the existence of O-containing functional groups such as carboxyl (COOH), hydroxyl (OH), and carbonyl (C@O) (Evangelou, 1995). The study of Compton et al. (2002) demonstrated that phosphorite grains can contain inclusions of organic matter, clay minerals, pyrite, quartz and biogenic calcite. Detailed lithologic examinations of the Hawthorn Group samples revealed the abundance of organic matter mostly in the Arcadia Formation. The HG-AFS analysis of samples with organic matter revealed As concentration of about 5 mg/kg. At the same time, concentrations of As in samples containing green clays with pyrite was as high as 69 mg/kg.\n\nIt has been shown that As incorporates into sediments by co-precipitation with HFO, or is adsorbed onto the extremely high surface area of precipitated HFO (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001;Evangelou, 1995;Pichler et al., 1999). The close connection between HFO and As is well documented (e.g., Pichler et al., 2001;Pichler and Veizer, 1999). Stow (1969) reported that most of the As in the Bone Valley Member of the Hawthorn Group was adsorbed onto HFO. Detailed lithologic examinations revealed the occurrence of HFO throughout the Hawthorn Group as stains or rings around pyrites. According to Compton et al. (1993) reworking of the Hawthorn Group sediment during periods of marine regressions caused oxidation of some pyrite and formation of HFO. The electron microprobe analysis showed that HFO from the undifferentiated Arcadia Formation contained up to 540 mg/kg As.\n\nIt appears that framboidal pyrite contained the majority of As in the Hawthorn Group. This can be verified by a simple mass balance approach using the bulk concentrations of Fe, S and As combined with As concentrations in individual pyrites. Due to the strong linear correlation between S and Fe (R 2 = 0.87), it is conceivable that Fe and S in Hawthorn Group samples are controlled largely by the presence of pyrite. The pyrite line (Fe = 2S) represents Fe/S ratios that are exclusively controlled by pyrite (Fig. 6). Thus, using the values of S and Fe, the abundance of pyrite in each sample was calculated. Then, the calculated amount of pyrite was multiplied by the mean As concentration in pyrite of each analyzed thin section and compared to the actual analyzed bulk As concentrations (Table 3). Calculated and measured As were compared in Fig. 15. For those samples that lie significantly above the equal concentration line, calculated As concentrations were lower than those measured in the bulk sample (Fig. 15). These results can be explained by existence of other sources of As (clays, francolite, organic material, HFO) or underestimation of the possible amount of pyrite, or an insufficient number of analyzed pyrite crystals. Sample 49-154.5 showed much higher calculated As concentration compared to a measured result probably due to overestimation of pyrite constituent or an insufficient number of analyzed pyrites.\n\nApatite group minerals are stable under a broad range of geologic conditions for millions of years (Wright, 1990;Nriagu, 1974). The trace elemental composition of the apatite fossil teeth and bones, and analyses of the sedimentary phosphorite deposits by Wright (1990) and others (Keto and Jacobsen, 1987;Shaw and Wasserburg, 1985) has revealed that biogenic and sedimentary apatite incorporates considerable amounts of radionuclides and metals from seawater. Different elements substitute for Ca, PO 4 and OH in the apatite crystal structure (Skinner and Catherine, 2002). Apatite locks these metals and radionuclides in a crystal structure for up to a billion years with no consequent leaching, exchange or desorption, even due to diagenetic changes in water chemistry, pH and temperatures. This is because the apatite mineral structure is very stable in a broad range of environmental conditions, such as pH 2 to 12, temperature as high as 1000 °C, and the presence of aqueous and non-aqueous solutions (Shields, 2002). Studies of the carbonate fluorapatite, francolite by McConnell (1973), Jahnke (1984) and Regnier et al. (1994) however suggest that the substitution of CO 2À 3 in carbonate fluorapatite leads to the destabilization of its crystal structure and, therefore, increase in solubility.\n\nThe Peace River Formation of the Hawthorn Group contains substantial amounts of francolite and is currently being exploited for phosphate ore. According to the present study, the Peace River Formation contained the highest concentration of As (l = 8.8 mg/kg) in the Hawthorn Group (Table 1). Detailed mineralogical analyses have confirmed the presence of ubiquitous framboidal pyrites harboring considerable amounts of As. In addition, EMPA elemental mapping has revealed that pyrite crystals were located both inside the francolite matrix with As as high as 3730 mg/kg (Fig. 10) and as a trace mineral in the sediment matrix with varying concentrations.\n\nBecause of the complicated distribution of pyrite in the Hawthorn Group, there are several potential scenarios that could lead to the mobilization of As during phosphate mining: (1) Oxidation of pyrite under aerobic conditions that could cause the release of substantial amounts of SO 4 ,\n\nTable 3 Calculated As concentrations in pyrite compared to measured bulk As concentrations Sample Hawthorn Fm/Mm a S (mg/kg) Fe (mg/kg) FeS 2 (mg/kg) FeS 2 (%) Mean As measured in pyrite (mg/kg) (n) As calculated in pyrite (mg/kg) As measured in bulk (mg/kg) 9-30 acids and As (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). Furthermore, these releases could lead to contamination of water supplies, pollution of rivers and bays in Florida, affecting aquatic life; and (2) breakdown of francolite nodules that contain As-enriched pyrite during phosphate ore processing.\n\nArsenic enrichment can cause several latent problems for the phosphate industry. First of all, As can be a significant toxin to livestock. There have been several incidences of swine fatalities due to As poisoning as a result of phosphate feed additives (El Bahri and Romdane, 1991). Additionally, the use of phosphates as fertilizers influences the release of As and enhances its mobility (Peryea, 1991). Arsenate and phosphate behave chemically similar and therefore, compete for binding sites in the soil. Phosphate addition to soils, for example, can enhance As release from specific sorption sites in soil through competitive anion exchange (Peryea and Kammereck, 1997).\n\n(1) arsenic content of the Hawthorn Group varied from formation to formation and was mostly concentrated in pyrite\n\n; (2) average As concentrations significantly changed from 8.8 mg/kg in the Peace River Formation to 3.0 mg/kg in the Tampa Member of the Arcadia Formation. Arsenic concentrations for all Hawthorn samples varied from 0.1 to 69.0 mg/kg; (3) pyrite, with the exception of one out of 362 samples, occurred as framboids and was unevenly distributed throughout the Hawthorn Group; (4) pyrite framboids were located inside the francolite matrix with As as high as 3730 mg/kg and as a trace mineral in the sediment with concentrations varying from <1 mg/kg to 8260 mg/kg; (5) hydrous ferric oxides contained As as high as 540 mg/kg; (6) francolite, organic material, and clays contained low As concentrations compared to pyrite; (7) arsenic enrichment in phosphate nodules contained in the Peace River Formation could pose a potential problem for the phosphate industry, because high As values in the phosphate-bearing rock can have a negative effect on ore processing and the quality of the final product; (8) mining induced release of As from the Peace River Formation is an environmental concern that warrants additional studies. As (mg/kg) calculated As (mg/kg) measured As meas. = As calc. 49-154.5 Fig. 15. Arsenic calculated vs. As measured from the Hawthorn Group. For samples in circle that lie significantly above the equal concentration line, calculated As concentrations were lower than those measured in the bulk. Sample 49-154.5 showed much higher calculated As concentration compared to a measured result probably due to overestimation of pyrite constituent or an insufficient number of analyzed pyrites.
