    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on the disappearance of fruit-eating animals and the recruitment of animal-, wind-, and gravity-dispersed trees in 80-year-old forest patches in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. We compared adult and juvenile trees in forest transects in a 3500-ha submontane forest with those in four forest fragments of 521, 30, 9, and 0.5 ha. Preliminary results show that recruitment of seedlings and juveniles of 31 animal-dispersed tree species was more than three times greater in continuous forest and large forest fragments ( Ն 30 ha) than in small forest fragments ( Յ 9 ha), whereas recruitment of eight wind-and gravity-dispersed trees of the forest interior was unaffected. Recruitment of 10 endemic, animal-dispersed tree species was 40 times lower in small fragments than in continuous forest or large fragments. Counts of diurnal primates and birds in all five sites indicated that frugivorous species have declined with decreasing fragment size. These results are consistent with the idea that loss of dispersal agents depresses tree recruitment in the course of forest fragmentation.",
    "full_text": "Consistent with MacArthur andWilson (1963, 1967), numerous studies have shown that species richness is proportional to the log of habitat area and inversely proportional to increasing distance from sources of potential immigrants (Laurance & Bierregaard 1997). These principles of island biogeography first explained equilibria of species richness defined by the interplay of immigration from source areas and extinction of island populations. Field studies also show, as predicted, increasing random extinction in recently fragmented habitats in which area is reduced and immigration among patches is limited (e.g., Laurance & Bierregaard 1997). In these situations rare species are lost most rapidly, and these losses increase proportionally as patch area declines ( Preston 1962;MacArthur 1972). Not yet explored in depth are likely nonrandom extinctions, even of common animals or plants, that occur because the process of fragmentation so alters biotic or abiotic conditions that even substantial populations of animals or plants are at risk.\n\nA likely nonrandom cause of extinction of tropical-forest tree species is reduced recruitment due to the loss of seed-dispersal agents, which we term the dispersaldependent tree hypothesis (Howe 1977). Some dispersal agents, such as medium to large interior-forest birds ( Johns 1991;Newmark 1991;Estrada et al. 1993;Bennun & Fanshawe 1998;Renjifo 1999) and understory bats (Cossons et al. 1999), disappear quickly during habitat fragmentation. Because most tropical trees bear fruit adapted for animal dispersal (McKey 1975;Howe 1986;Willson 1989), frugivorous animals are often thought to be critical components of tropical forests because they disperse seeds in ways that enhance seedling recruitment ( Janzen 1970;Connell 1971;Howe & Smallwood 1982;Clark & Clark 1984;Howe 1993). This may be true for tree species that are particularly vulnerable to density-or distancedependent seed or seedling mortality, but not for others that are more resistant to such sources of mortality early in life ( Janzen & Martin 1982;Howe 1989). We offer a preliminary test of the disperser-dependent tree hypothesis in montane forest fragments of the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania.\n\nConsistent with ample evidence elsewhere in the tropics (e.g., Bierregaard & Stouffer 1997;Warburton 1997;Ganzhorn et al. 1999;Renjifo 1999), we predict that smaller fragments will lose large frugivores, a process of local extinction that will negatively affect recruitment of dependent tree species with animal-dispersed seeds. We surveyed diurnal primates and birds in four fragments and adjacent continuous forest to evaluate this prediction. A large literature shows that vertebrate herbivory alters the composition of plant communities (Howe &Brown 1999, 2000, andreferences therein), and a smaller number of studies show that mutualists, such as ant dispersers (Horvitz & Schemske 1995), alter the population structure of Neotropical herb populations. One or the other or a synergy of such processes may affect tree recruitment in the forest fragments of the Usambaras.\n\nWe used densities of size classes of trees from four fragments and adjacent continuous forest to test the idea that tree species with animal-dispersed seeds in fragments suffer reduced recruitment compared with trees that are not dispersed by animals. We expect that expanding populations of tree species have, on average, high densities of seedlings ( Ͻ 1 cm diameter at breast height [dbh], Ͻ 1 m tall) and juveniles (1-5 cm dbh) and progressively lower densities of saplings and adults. This pattern should prevail for trees with seeds dispersed by animals and by other means in expanding plant populations, such as large fragments and continuous forests. To the degree that fragmentation introduces biotic or abi-otic factors that depress recruitment, we expect reduced representation of seedlings and juveniles in small fragments. If abiotic conditions similarly affect both animaldispersed and non-animal-dispersed species, one would expect similar size-class patterns among all trees in fragments of different sizes. Dramatically lower densities of seedlings and juveniles compared with adults in the smaller fragments occurred among trees with animal-dispersed seeds, but not trees with seeds dispersed by wind or gravity. We hypothesize that loss of dispersal agents plays a major role in the loss of dispersal-dependent trees in the fragmentation process.\n\nThe East Usambara Mountains (lat. 4 Њ S, long. 38 Њ E), located within the Eastern Arc Mountain Ranges of northeast Tanzania, are renowned for their exceptional biodiversity and high levels of endemism for most biota (e.g., Lovett & Wasser 1993;Stattersfield et al. 1998). These mountains rise from the coast to 1500 m, with an extensive plateau from 800-1000 m. The climate follows a bimodal monsoon pattern, and rainfall on the plateau averages 2000 m annually (Hamilton & Bensted-Smith 1989). Current forest cover, including the lowlands, is estimated at 45,000 ha ( Johansson & Sandy 1996), although much of it is highly fragmented where clearing for colonial estates, commercial logging and-more recently-shifting cultivation have been agents of forest loss. Many fragments, ranging in area from Ͻ 1 to 521 ha, occur adjacent to continuous forest of 3500 ha in the montane region, all of which are separated by tea plantations and subsistence cultivation and have been isolated for at least 80 years (Newmark 1991). At least 22% of the East Usambara flora is endemic, whereas 30% of trees in both the East and West Usambaras are endemic (Iversen 1991). Many threatened animals occur there too (Lovett & Wasser 1993;Stattersfield et al. 1998). Of the 217 tree species known to occur in the forested plateau, Allanblackia stuhlmannii , Cephalosphaera usambarensis, Isoberlinia scheffleri , Newtonia buchananii , Odyendea zimmermannii , Strombosia scheffleri, Chrysophyllum perpulchrum , and Parinari excelsa are common in the overstory in the study area (Hamilton & Bensted-Smith 1989;Schulman et al. 1998).\n\nWe sampled tree-size distributions in four fragments (521, 30, 9, and 0.5 ha) and a little-disturbed continuous forest (3500-ha submontane forest). The shortest distance to the 3500-ha patch of the four fragments was variable but was Ͻ 6.5 km. This 3500 ha of submontane habitat, which is continuous with 4000 ha of lowland forest, was our largest patch. We established vegetation transects of 100 m in the large forest patches and 50 m in the smaller patches ( Ͻ 30 ha). All trees with a dbh of Ͼ 5 cm were enumerated within 5 m on either side of transects, and those with a dbh Յ 5 cm were counted within 2 m. Plants were grouped into six size classes: Ͻ 1 m high or Ͻ 1 cm dbh, and 1-5, 6-15, 16-25, 26-50, and Ͼ 50 cm dbh. Of the 77 tree species recorded from these transects, 38 that attain a dbh of Ͼ 25 cm upon maturity were used in the analyses. Transects began at least 25 m inside the \"soft\" (overgrown) edges, where possible, and continued into the fragment.\n\nTree species were categorized as animal-dispersed (31 species, n ϭ 1039) and non-animal dispersed (dispersed by other means, such as gravity, wind, or water; 8 species, n ϭ 187) based on descriptions of fruits in the literature ( Flora of Tropical East Africa ) and personal inspection of some of the diaspores. Ten animal-dispersed species occurring in the transects are endemic or nearendemic to the Eastern Arc Mountains (Hamilton & Bensted-Smith 1989;Lovett & Friis 1996;Lovett 1998): Anisophyllea obtusifolia (Anisophyllaceae), Annickia kummeriae (Annonaceae), Allanblackia stuhlmannii (Clusiaceae), Beilschmiedia kweo (Lauraceae), Cephalosphaera usambarensis (Myristicaceae), Allophylus melliodorus (Sapindaceae), Cola greenwayi , Leptonychia usa mbarensis (Sterculiaceae), Alsodeiopsis schumannii (Icacinaceae), and Maranthes goetzeniana (Chrysobalanaceae). Ten common pioneer species typical of open, disturbed sites, for which no definitive patterns existed across patches, were not included in the analyses because their use would have been inconsistent with our objective of exploring dynamics of trees of the forest interior.\n\nTo establish frugivorous animal species lists for all these sites, diurnal primates and birds were counted from February to October 2000. All non-edge, facultative, and obligate frugivorous forest species recorded Ն 300 m inside the edge of the two largest fragments are included. Species richnesses were evaluated with standardized transects and point counts. These data were augmented with observations recorded during other visits to the fragments. Transect line lengths of 500 m were located in three widely separated sites in each of the two largest fragments, and a single transect line bisected the center of each patch (i.e., 70, 160, 375 m for 0.5, 9, and 30 ha, respectively) at the smaller sites. Relative abundances were estimated by point counts of 15 minutes each, stratified by fragment size at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 12 for the 0.5-, 9-, 30-, 521-, and 3500-ha fragments, respectively. The two largest patches each had four point counts in three separate sites. Point counts were conducted between 0600 and 0830 hours, whereas line transects generally were sampled for primates from 0830 to 1100 hours. Transect surveys and point counts were done in the hot, cold, and short rainy seasons. Numbers of individuals per point were averaged over the three seasons.\n\nBecause the sample effort for patches of 9 and 0.5 ha was different than for larger patches, we used the G test for heterogeneity to test the independence of frequency distributions of trees in different size classes with respect to sites, which in our case examined the expected versus the observed proportions in each class. We used regressions to examine seedling and juvenile densities as a function of log area of fragments for animal-dispersed species and species dispersed by other means. Animal-dispersed species were further subdivided into endemic (323 plants) and nonendemic (716 plants) categories, for which similar regressions were performed. For diurnal, frugivorous animals, we used a regression to examine the relationship between forest interior species and the log area of fragments.\n\nSize-class distributions were significantly different across sites for tree species dispersed by animals as well as those dispersed by other means. With respect to the proportions of each size class for animal-dispersed tree species, the continuous forest and two largest fragments (i.e., 30 and 521 ha) had high seedling and juvenile proportions, with progressively lower proportions of the larger size classes (including endemics: G test ϭ 59.32, df ϭ 20, p Ͻ 0.005; Fig. 1). In contrast, for tree species not dispersed by animals, seedling proportions were not distinct except for a superabundance of seedlings and juveniles of Newtonia buchananii in the smallest fragment ( G test ϭ 47.41, df ϭ 20, p Ͻ 0.005; Figs. 1b & 2b). When analyzed separately, both nonendemic species dispersed by animals ( G test ϭ 47.79, df ϭ 20, p Ͻ 0.001; Fig. 1) and endemic species dispersed by animals ( G test ϭ 42.4, df ϭ 20, p Ͻ 0.01; Fig. 1) showed marked differences across fragment sizes: overall, proportions of seedling and juvenile endemics were lower than those of nonendemics.\n\nReduced recruitment was further indicated when the densities of each size class were compared with the patch total (Fig. 2), presenting a clearer visual picture of the reduced densities of seedlings and juveniles relative to those of the larger size classes in the two smallest patches. Seedlings and juveniles of endemic species dispersed by animals were particularly scarce in the smallest fragments (Figs. 1 & 2), but adults were also scarce. Only two large individuals of the endemics Allophylus melliodorus and Allanblackia stuhlmannii were found in transects from the two smallest fragments. Only A. melliodorus had juveniles in the 0.5-ha patch, and only A. stuhlmannii had juveniles in the 9-ha patch. In comparison, the two larger patches and continuous forest had more seedlings and juveniles than larger size classes. In contrast, the difference for nonendemics was due to general trends in 8-10 species per fragment.\n\nRegression of seedling and juvenile density against the log area of fragments for animal-dispersed species yielded a significant positive slope (slope ϭ 0.068, R 2 ϭ 0.79, p Ͻ 0.05, 776 plants), indicating lower recruitment in the smaller fragments (Fig. 3). Separation of the animal-dispersed group into endemics and nonendemics was instructive. Regression of seedling and juvenile density of 10 endemic animal-dispersed species against log patch area was significant (slope ϭ 0.026, R 2 ϭ 0.79, p Ͻ 0.05, 247 plants), whereas comparable regression of seedlings and juveniles of 18 nonendemic, animal-dispersed species was marginally significant (slope ϭ 0.042, R 2 ϭ 0.75, p ϭ 0.06, 529 plants). In contrast, regression of seedling and juvenile density against the log of patch area was not significant for 8 tree species dispersed by wind or gravity ( p Ͼ 0.15, 152 plants).\n\nA regression of the number of diurnal frugivorous bird and primate species against fragment area was positive (slope ϭ 0.12, R 2 ϭ 0.92, p Յ 0.01), indicating fewer frugivore species in small than in large fragments. Potentially important for seed dispersal, some common avian frugivores declined in relative abundance with a decline in fragment size (Table 1). More comprehensive surveys than had been conducted at the time of analysis indicate that likely potential dispersal agents are absent or few in number in fragments of Յ 30 ha. These dispersed agents include hornbills ( Bycanistes brevis , B. bucinator ), pigeons ( Columba arquatrix , C. delegorguei), a barbet (Stactolaema olivacea), a turaco (Tauraco fischeri), an oriole (Oriolus chlorocephalus), diurnal primates (Cercopithecus mitis, Papio cynocephalus), a galago (Otolemur garnettii), the bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus), greenbuls (Andropadus milanjensis, A. masukuensis, A. virens), and perhaps one starling (Poeoptera kenrickii).\n\nDespite recent interest in how fragmentation affects different animal and plant taxa (e.g., Laurance & Bierregaard 1997, and references therein), how fragmentation affects key plant-animal interactions is still largely unex- plored. For seed-dispersal systems, defined as populations of trees and the animals that facilitate or preclude seed dispersal and seedling recruitment (Howe & Estabrook 1977), the implications of fragmentation on animalmediated tree recruitment have been objects of speculation for decades (e.g., Howe 1977Howe , 1984Howe , 1989;;Terborgh 1986). It is increasingly clear that density-dependent mortality of seeds is a fact of life and death for a wide array of Neotropical trees (Harms et al. 2000), but the actual effects of disperser loss on forest integrity are unknown. Because some fruit-eating animals are likely to be more severely affected by forest fragmentation than others, it is likely that the effects of forest fragmentation on tree populations, if any, will vary with the identity of effective dispersal agents that eat their fruits.\n\nIt is not a foregone conclusion that the loss of animals that consistently eat the fruits of a given tree species will strongly affect tree demography. Janzen and Martin (1982) hypothesize that many Neotropical fruits are adaptive anachronisms left over from extinction of the American megafauna 10,000-20,000 years ago. Application of this \"megafaunal fruit syndrome\" to particular species and fruit types is problematic ( Howe 1985), but many trees appear to have survived the extinction of large mammalian dispersal agents over 0.5-10 million years (e.g., Webb 1983Webb , 1984)). Consistently \"clump-dispersed\" seeds ( Howe 1989) may represent species that are so resistant to agents of seed and seedling mortality that they can survive without dispersal agents for millennia at the least.\n\nCurrent knowledge suggests that the effects of fragmentation differ for frugivores by taxa, body size, and habitat preference (e.g., Restrepo et al. 1997;Warburton 1997;Cossons et al. 1999). Many smaller birds and bats increase with forest fragmentation because the fruits that attract them are small-seeded, early-successional tree and shrub species that increase in abundance as habitat is broken up (e.g., Estrada et al. 1993;Cardoso da Silva et al. 1996;Githiru 1999). In contrast, frugivorous understory bats of the forest interior (Cossons et al. 1999) and less common and often larger obligate avian frugivores, which require large tracts of primary forest, are expected to decline in abundance as food resources decline (e.g., Howe 1984). Declining numbers of large fruiting trees and the variability or chance failure of their crops in any given year are likely to contribute to declines in fruit-eating animals in isolated patches (e.g., Foster 1982, Howe 1982, 1993). Pressures from hunting may also take their toll, particularly for some primates and large aerial frugivores such as hornbills and fruit bats (e.g., Chapman & Chapman 1996;Whitney et al. 1998). With loss of dispersers through fragmentation, declines are expected in the abundance of primary-forest trees, including endemics.\n\nOur preliminary evidence is consistent with data from other forests. The number of species of fruit-eating birds and primates increased with fragment size (R 2 ϭ 0.92, p Յ 0.01), indicating fewer species in small fragments than in large fragments, and the relative abundance of some fruit-eating birds declined sharply as fragment size declined (Table 1). The opportunity for effective dispersal by birds or primates appears to decline abruptly with the decline of patch size.\n\nPreliminary results from the East Usambara Mountains indicate that recruitment of animal-dispersed trees is low in small forest fragments, giving strong if indirect evidence that loss of dispersal agents is at issue. Abiotic influences on seedling fate, such as increased diffuse light with greater edge-to-area ratios in smaller fragments, might be expected to affect trees dispersed by animals and other means similarly (Laurance et al. 1998a(Laurance et al. , 1998b)). This is not the case in the East Usambaras. We found that gravity-or winddispersed trees of the forest interior were doing as well in small as in large fragments. In contrast, recruitment of endemic animal-dispersed species was more than 40 times greater in large fragments and continuous forest than in small fragments. Recruitment of trees dispersed by animals in general, and endemics in particular, declined with reduction in patch size.\n\nReductions in both the quantity and quality of dispersal, relative to the trees, are likely to explain why animal-dispersed tree species, in particular endemics, have lower recruitment in smaller than in larger fragments (Schupp 1993). A reduction in the quantity of seeds dispersed occurs if key dispersal agents are absent or reduced in numbers in small fragments. Reduction in quality occurs if substitute dispersal agents handle fruits improperly or deposit seeds in inappropriate places or spatial arrangements. Our preliminary animal surveys suggest that both processes may be underway in the Usambaras.\n\nEffects of losses of dispersal agents occurs more rapidly for some trees than others. Some large birds and bats of forest interiors commute from fragment to fragment. Excessive time spent searching and in transit, and use of easily available fruits of pioneer trees, likely result in reduced visitation to favored fruiting trees and therefore in incremental declines in seedling recruitment. Other frugivores, such as arboreal primates and certain deep-forest birds, rarely, if ever, commute. If the effects of local extinction of primates or other less mobile dispersal agents from small patches occur, they are likely to be immediate and categorical (e.g., Asquith et al. 1999).\n\nTable 1.

Seedling and juvenile densities of species dispersed by animals and species not dispersed by animals as a function of the log area of fragments. There is a significant regression of density and the log area of patches for animal-dispersed species, with a positive slope suggesting that recruitment is depressed as a function of decreasing area (seedling survival/juvenile density ϭ 0.068 log area ϩ 0.052; R 2 ϭ 0.79, p Ͻ 0.05). Seedling and juvenile densities of species not dispersed by animals did not have a significant negative slope.\n\nSuch declines can be expected where density-dependent mortality below parent plants is consistently devastating (Howe 1989), and clearly occur in our study in animal-dispersed tree taxa, including several species endemic to the East Usambara Mountains and nearby ranges. We interpret the apparent high proportion of large individuals of animal-dispersed endemics in the smallest fragments partially as a sampling artifact-there are few individuals, and they are large-but we also suspect historical causes. These species were once common, but no longer recruit. Nonendemic, animal-dispersed species may have even higher absolute densities of large adults in small fragments, perhaps reflecting the release of species disseminated by generalists shortly after isolation. At the present time in our fragments, however, the entire category of animal-dispersed endemics bears fruit but does not recruit.\n\nOther evidence is consistent with the dispersal-dependent tree hypothesis that holds elsewhere in Africa. In Uganda, Chapman and Chapman (1995) found that seedlings and saplings under and away from individual parent trees of Uvariopsis congensis, Teclea nobilis, Balanites wilsonia, and Pseudospondias microcarpa in continuous logged forest have Ͼ10 juveniles under their crowns, indicating some survival (likely ϽϽϽ1% of the seed crop) near parents without dispersal. In contrast, negligible recruitment of seedlings under parents, but the presence of a few to many seedlings away from parents, suggests that at least 15 of the 21 other tree species would be vulnerable to local extinction if all frugivores were to be extirpated (see species list in Table 1 of Chapman & Chapman 1995). In a study comparing continuous forest and fragments with and without primate dispersers, Chapman and Onderdonk (1998) found that both seedling density and the number of seedling species decline in fragments, pointing to an effect of the loss of important dispersal agents. A large number of the seedlings in fragments are from small-seeded species that are more likely dispersed by birds and bats able to cross inhospitable terrain. Largeseeded species appear to fare less favorably (cf. Kapos et al. 1997). In Madagascar, Ganzhorn et al. (1999) found that fragments without the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) have fewer lemur-dispersed species regenerating than expected, given the presence of mature individual trees. In continuous forest in which the lemur was present, lemur-dispersed juvenile plants reflect the abundance of mature trees.\n\nOther effects could produce similar results, but we do not yet see compelling evidence that they do. Specialized pollinators could be limited in small fragments for some animal-and wind-dispersed species (Aizen & Feinsinger 1994). All of our species are animal-pollinated.\n\nThe generalized flower structure, which should attract small or generalized pollinators least likely to suffer from fragmentation, and copious fruit production of most species, including those with lowered recruitment, does not suggest obvious pollination limitation. Increased seed predation by rodents, either invasive species from surrounding agricultural land or large populations of resident species, for some trees could explain reduced recruitment independent of reduced dispersal (Leigh et al. 1993;Chapman & Chapman 1995). Ongoing trapping offers no evidence of substantial rodent invasion or high populations of the ubiquitous giant pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) in small fragments. If rodents were an issue, we would expect reduced recruitment of wind-and gravity-dispersed species as well as animal-dispersed species. No reduction of recruitment in wind-or gravity-dispersed species is evident.\n\nIf it proves true that primary-forest trees normally dispersed by vertebrates experience markedly lower recruitment as a result of disperser loss in small forest fragments, the ecological effects of such \"linked webs of extinction\" on forest composition may be profound (Howe 1977(Howe , 1984(Howe , 1989)). One expects loss of dependent tree species when key dispersal agents disappear, altering the diet and relative abundance of remaining dispersal agents, and changing the abundance ranks of tree species that are able to recruit seedlings. Some general dangers are evident. Logging targets species with timber of high value, and many such species are animal-dispersed in tropical forests, including forests of the Usambara Mountains (Hamilton & Bensted-Smith 1989). Limiting the selective removal of such species might prevent the loss of frugivores and thereby sustain trees dependent on them. Also, replanting tree species that provide critical fruit resources (Howe 1984), endemic or not, but recruit unsuccessfully in fragments might be a proactive step toward avoiding the loss of both critical frugivores and their dependent tree species. Better definition of the issues requires better understanding of the ecological strengths and weaknesses of tree codependencies with fruit-eating animals.\n\nCordeiro & HoweRecruitment of Animal-Dispersed Trees\n\nCordeiro & Howe"
