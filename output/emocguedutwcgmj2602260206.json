    "abstract": "We report on the use of penile tumescence assessment to diagnose a paraphiliac client who was in denial about his problem. An 18-year-old male was accused of sexually assaulting a 4-year-old girl using physical restraint and vaginal penetration with a finger. During a psychiatric evaluation requested by the court, a comprehensive psychosexual assessment revealed that the subject was in denial about clarification of the paraphiliac experience. Penile tumescence under distinct visual stimulus was evaluated with electrobioimpedence volumetric assessment using child and adult female pictures in separate time frames. Both types of stimuli evoked arousal responses. However, child female stimuli demonstrated stronger responses than did adult female ones. Deviant sexual interest in children as well as a diagnosis of pedophilia was implied. Paraphiliac clients tend to be in denial toward psychosexual assessment which limits the interpretation of its results. Penile tumescence assessment may be more reliable than psychosexual assessment alone for detecting and diagnosing paraphilia. Further study is warranted in order to aid in more accurate diagnoses of paraphilia.",
    "full_text": "P araphilia is defined as recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors that occur over a period of at least 6 months generally involving 1) nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons (Criterion A). Such behaviors, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B). (1) The sensitive and private characteristic of sexuality, especially regarding issues of deviant sexual interests, makes clinical evaluation and diagnosis of paraphilia difficult. The actual incidence of paraphilia is widely regarded as being underestimated. (2) Paraphilias such as pedophilia or sadism, which carry a high risk of attendant sexual offenses, usually come to the attention of clinicians after an arrest and a court order for psychiatric evaluation. Among legally recognized cases of paraphilias, pedophilia is the most common. (3) Clinical evaluation of paraphilia includes interviews, psychological assessments, and psychophysiological assessments. (2,4) However, the frequent existence of denial strongly impacts clinical judgments. (5,6) Taiwan currently lacks methodologies and tools for effectively evaluating and diagnosing paraphiliac patients. This article reports on the examination of 1 sex offender using penile tumescence assessment with distinct\n\nvisual stimuli which made the evaluation and diagnosis of paraphilia more effective and reliable than with psychosexual assessment alone.\n\nMr. A, a single 18-year-old male, was accused of binding the hands of a 4-year-old female child and using his left index finger to penetrate her vagina, resulting in traumatic bleeding about 1 year prior to the clinical interview. He was transferred to our hospital for psychiatric evaluation on the order of the judge in charge of his case.\n\nMr. A was born without perinatal complications and denied any developmental milestone delays. He had displayed poor academic performance since childhood, and there were no records of any prior illegal acts. Neither a general medical condition nor substance abuse was noted. Physical and neurologi-cal examinations revealed no abnormalities. Electroencephalography was negative. His serum testosterone level was within the normal range (4.01 ng/ml).\n\nBorderline intelligence with an IQ of 78 was found by utilizing the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test showed no obvious abnormalities. He denied pedophilic or other paraphiliac tendencies in the psychosexual diagnostic inventory of sex offenses, (7) and neither gender identity disorder nor sexual dysfunction was found. In response to the psychosexual development inventory used with sex offenders, (7) he denied any sexual assault or past history of sexual abuse and claimed no experience of morning erection or sexual fantasies. He said he had begun to masturbate when he was 15-year-old with a frequency of 2-3 times per week, and that it was pleasurable without using any fantasies or negative thoughts. At the Fig. 1 Response curves toward child depictions in terms of erection (marked by the arrow), penile length (cm), cross-sectional area (cm 2 ), and volume (c.c.). The average length was 12.87 cm, the cross-sectional area was 2.64 cm 2 , and the volume was 32.05 (c.c.). same age, he had begun using pornography, and watched erotic films once a week. He admitted having a girlfriend who was a year younger than himself when he was in junior high school, but denied any experience of sexual intercourse. During clarification of the sex offense, he admitted having the urge to touch girls who were 3 to 4 years of age. However, he denied any penile erection or arousal response associated with that impulse.\n\nWe used a penile electrobioimpedence volumetric assessment (8) to measure penile tumescence changes while alternatively presenting the subject with stimuli involving child and adult female depictions. The results, demonstrated by computerized analysis, are as follows: (1) the responses recorded with female child stimuli were 12.87 cm in average penile length, 2.64 cm 2 in cross-sectional area, and 32.05 ml in volume (Fig. 1); (2) the responses recorded with adult female stimuli were 9.30 cm in average penile length, 1.79 cm 2 in cross-sectional area, and 16.60 ml in volume (Fig. 2). Sexual arousal during presentation with female child depictions was obviously greater than that with adult female depictions.\n\nWe concluded that his mental status was normal and had not been influenced by mental illness or substance abuse during the time of the sexual offense. Borderline intelligence was found by psychological assessment. During the clinical interview and inventories of the psychosexual evaluation, he denied any paraphiliac tendency and only admitted having the impulse to touch female children who were 3 to 4 years old. The penile electrobioimpedence volumetric assessment demonstrated that penile tumescence under stimuli using female child depictions was much stronger than that using adult female stimuli. Fig. 2 Response curves toward adult female depictions in terms of erection (marked by the arrow), penile length (cm), cross-sectional area (cm 2 ), and volume (c.c.). The erection time was 1, the average length was 9.30 cm, the cross-sectional area was 1.79 cm 2 , and the volume was 16.6. (c.c.). sexual interest and sexual arousal toward female children as well as a diagnosis of pedophilia was our final impression.\n\nPedophilia is the most common form of legally identified cases of paraphilia. (3) The most prominent feature of pedophilia is repeated utilization of children and associated materials as stimuli for sexual arousal. The contents of sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors generally involve children under the age of 13 years. (1) It may be difficult for a pedophiliac patient to obtain sexual gratification from normal adult male-female sexual relationships, resulting in the occurrence of sexual dysfunction in such situations. Standard psychological tests are not particularly useful with persons alleged to have a paraphilia because these instruments are designed to assess such factors as intelligence and personality types and do not differentially identify paraphilia. (2) Although some psychological tests address issues that are relevant to understanding and treating paraphiliac persons, they are limited to and rely on self-reporting by the person being tested. In this case, evaluating his psychosexuality through clinical interviews and inventories exploring psychosexual developmental history and diagnosis (7) produced no specific finding, but merely demonstrated denial of experiences of sexual fantasies and associated physiological arousal responses. His admission of the deviant impulse to touch female children 3 to 4 years of age made the suspicion of pedophilia reasonable. However, denial of sex offenses and minimization of the psychopathology are so common in alleged sex offenders that they impact clinical judgments and diagnoses. (9) Psychophysiological assessments of paraphilia include plethysmography, visual reaction time, and polygraph tests. (2) Plethysmography is the most widely used method for the clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and follow-up of paraphilias. (5) Penile plethysmography as initially described by Freund involves measuring volume or circumferential changes in the penis while concomitantly presenting the patient with stimuli involving discrete categories of paraphilic stimuli. (10) The theoretical basis of this method is a \"sexual preference hypothesis\" that rests on 2 assumptions. First, it assumes that deviant cues evoke stronger sexual arousal in patients than normal sexual cues. Second, the overt behavioral preference these patients show for deviant acts is a product of this stronger arousal, perhaps because the gratification consequent upon acting on this stronger arousal is greater. Based on this rationale, behavioral assessment of patients has depended greatly on measures of sexual arousal as represented by the assessment of penile tumescence in the laboratory. (11) In this case, we utilized distinct visual stimuli using child and adult female pictures at separate times to evaluate penile tumescence by penile electrobioimpedence volumetric assessment. (8) Results of female child stimuli produced penile tumescence that was 1.38 times greater in penile length, 1.47 times greater in cross-sectional area, and 1.93 times greater in volume than comparable measurements using adult female stimuli. All measures with female child stimuli being clearly higher than those with adult female stimuli indicates that much stronger penile tumescence was detected in this subject when presented with child stimuli. A deviant sex interest in and sexual arousal by female children as well as a diagnosis of pedophilia were indicated.\n\nPenile electrobioimpedence volumetric assessment is a procedure that can measure penile length, cross-sectional area, and volume. From these variables, the extent of penile tumescence can be determined for comparisons. (8) Unlike penile plethysmography, the procedure is not completely a real-time measurement or comparison of penile tumescence; however, it is a more accurate measure of arousal than circumference plethysmography at low levels of response. (12) As with plethysmography, there is no standardization of stimuli and presentation, impairing the validity of the diagnosis. (2,13) However, sensitivity and specificity have been established for testing patients suspected of pedophilia using penile plethysmography. (2) Penile tumescence assessment is valuable for clinically evaluating and diagnosing paraphilia. Further study is warranted in order to aid in the reliable diagnosis and follow-up of paraphilia."
