    "abstract": "RESUME\nL'étude statistique de certaines variables hydrologiques telles que le débit les précipitations, etc. est souvent concentrée sur un aspect particulier de la variable: les valeurs extrêmes. Si les données historiques disponibles sont suffisantes, elles permettront l'ajustement d'une courbe analytique du type classique, offrant ainsi la possibilité d'estimer la fréquence des valeurs à l'extérieur du domaine de l'enregistrement direct. C'est ainsi que l'on peut évaluer la crue centennale, millenale, etc. Le problème que nous abordons dans cet article est le suivant: malgré que la plupart des fonctions utilisées pour l'estimation des valeurs maximales (ou minimales) aient un domaine non borne dans la direction de notre variable, celle-ci possède effectivement des bornes physiques réelles. Dans le cas du debit maximum, nous avons considère comme borne supérieure la crue maximum probable (CMP) ce qui limite l'ajustement aux fonctions de la famille beta. Plusieurs rivières ayant un nombre suffisant de données historiques et pour lesquelles on a évalue la CMP, ont été considérées. Apres, on a calculé les quartiles supérieurs par des méthodes classiques (log-Pearson III, Pearson III et Gumbel), par des méthodes utilisant des moments supérieurs, loi d'entropie maximale et par la fonction beta limitée par la CMP. et al.\nthe beta family. Several rivers for which sufficient records are available have been analysed in order to evaluate their MPF. Then, floods with high return period were estimated by several ways: classical methods (log-Pearson III, Pearson III and Gumbel); methods using high order parameters (maximum entropy distribution); and using beta approximation with MPF bound.",
    "full_text": "ABSTRACT The statistical analysis of some hydrological variables like river discharge, precipitation, etc. is often restricted to one specific aspect: the extreme values. If the historical samples are sufficient, the adjustment of classical distribution curves permits the evaluation of those values outside the sample domain. In this manner, floods having return periods of 100, 1000 and 10 000 years can be estimated. In this paper, the following problem is analysed: most of the functions used for evaluation of maximum values of hydrological variables are unbounded, at least above. However, variables like river flow have in fact a real physical upper limit as well as a lower one. The former is called the maximum probable flood (MPF) and under this hypothesis, the adjustment should be limited to curves of 77\n\nL'estimation d'événements extrêmes d'une variable hydrologique tel que le débit d'un cours d'eau est un problème fondamental pour l'ingénieur ou le responsable de la conception des travaux de génie civil. Qu'il s'agisse du design de structures pour le contrôle d'inondations ou pour la gestion des ressources hydriques aux niveaux critiques, la recherche des valeurs extremes constitue le premier pas, et souvent l'objectif, de toute analyse hydrologique. Il est évident que la connaissance précise et absolue de ces valeurs extrêmes pour de très faibles ou très hautes probabilités, est en général impossible à cause du caractère aléatoire des variables hydrologiques et de la complexité des microphénomènes qui les composent. Dans les problèmes de débit, sujet de cette recherche, le choix de la période de retour pour la crue de projet dépend des critères économiques ou d'évaluation du risque admissible par des méthodes bayesiennes ou autres.\n\nUne fois que cette période de retour, centennale, millénale, décamillénale, etc. a été déterminée, le calcul de la crue, ou de l'étiage, correspondant se fait par deux méthodes qui sont à l'origine de deux écoles de pensées. L'école, ou la méthode, déterministe centre son analyse sur l'étude des phénomènes physiques qui sont la cause principale du caractère extrême de l'événement. L'étude hydrographique, météorologique, tarissement des hydrogrammes, persistence d'averses, etc. sont des exemples typiques d'approche déterministe dans laquelle les relations causeeffet sont connues ou prévisibles.\n\nL'école stochastique donne, par contre, au phénomène hydrologique un caractère à dominance aléatoire et son étude est basée spécifiquement sur l'observation du comportement du phénomène dans le passé et l'hypothèse, plus ou moins restrictive, de stationnarité, ergodicité et invariance dans le futur. Pour développer son analyse, l'hydrologue de cette école part d'un échantillon d'observations antérieures et par l'ajustement de certaines lois ou fonctions analytiques particulières, il est en mesure d'évaluer les quartiles déjà définis pour son projet ou pour son objectif final. Les types de fonctions utilisées ont été incroyablement nombreuses dans le passé, mais un survol attentif nous permet de dégager certaines tendances. Au commencement des années 50, l'emploi des lois a faible nombre de paramètres (normale, exponentielle, etc.) semblait dominer le scénario sans doute à cause de la petite capacité opérationnelle disponible.\n\nMarkovic en 1965 fait une étude systématique sur l'applicabilité de certaines lois aux phénomènes hydrologiques tels que les precipitations et le débit. Les valeurs extrêmes ont été analysées par grand nombre d'hydrologues suivant la méthode de Gumbel (1958), d'événements extrêmes 79\n\nWeibull, Shane & Graver (1969), log-Pearson III (Bobee & Robitaille (1981)), etc. Plus tard, a. cause de la facilité opérationnelle croissante créée par les ordinateurs digitaux, on a même pu utiliser des lois ayant un nombre supérieur de paramètres leur donnant une plus grande flexibilité et précision, lorsque l'échantillon était suffisamment long. Les lois ainsi employées étaient: les séries de Gram-Charlier (Kendall & Stuart, 1963), la fonction gamma avec des polynômes Laguerre (Llamas, 1975), la fonction d'entropie maximale (Siddall, 1983), etc. En ce qui concerne l'étude du débit d'une rivière, toutes ces lois partent du principe de l'existence d'une borne inférieure finie (zéro, la plupart du temps), ce qui est physiquement correct, et d'une asymptote pour la limite supérieure où lim^ F(x) = 1.\n\nEn réalité, il va sans dire que dans toutes les rivières du monde, il existe une borne physique supérieure du débit aussi grande soit-elle, mais parfaitement finie. La connaissance de cette borne supérieure nous permettrait d'ouvrir le chemin de l'évaluation des quartiles supérieurs aux courbes de la famille beta, avec probablement un plus grand réalisme que la limite supérieure infinie. Dans ce travail, nous avons considéré, comme borne supérieure, la valeur de la crue maximale probable (CMP), calculée par des méthodes classiques de maximisation. Les paramètres de la fonction beta ont été estimés par la méthode des moments.\n\nLa fonction de distribution beta entre les bornes a et b a comme fonction de densité:\n\nf(y) = t B( b -1 a) t-i) ( y -a)r_1 (b -y )t ~r_1 a s y s b (D R (r -l)!(t -r -1) ! ,\".\n\nLa fonction (1) a quatre paramètres: t, r, a et b dont l'estimation peut être faite par la méthode des moments. Les paramètres a et b représentent respectivement les bornes inférieure et supérieure de la variable.\n\nSoit le cas particulier de la fonction beta (1) définie entre les bornes 0 et 1, f( X ) = i x r-1 (ix ) t _ r _ 1 0 S x S 1 (3) B On peut prouver assez facilement que les variables x et y sont liées par une relation linéaire de la forme y = x(b -a) + a, relation que nous allons utiliser pour calculer les moments a l'origine de y. Les moments de x peuvent être obtenus directement. L'expression générale est (Mood & Graybill, 1963).\n\net al. L'expression (8) permet de calculer tous les moments a l'origine de la variable y et, par la suite, d'évaluer les quatre paramètres de la distribution.\n\nSi la borne supérieure b est connue (ou supposée), le calcul des trois autres paramètres a, r et t est effectué en résolvant le système de trois équations de (8) avec k = 1, 2 et 3. Etant donné la complexité des équations des moments supérieurs, la solution du système doit se faire par la méthode d'essais successifs. Le système à résoudre sera: m î = n E i=l y i = a + (b \" a) t\" (9)\n\n•i -; E î=i 'I =*' • 3 * 2 <\" -\"Ï •»*<'• \" \" 2 ÏTTT^ Le système (9) a (11) se simplifie considérablement si le coefficient d'asymétrie est pris comme le troisième estimateur.\n\n^3 _ 2(t -2r) t(t + 2)s c s = ~i = \";\" . o,\" Les valeurs de t, r et a nous définissent la f .d.p.

Avec un changement de variable x^ = y^/y, les paramètres sont:\n\nx = 1; s 2 = 0.0523; b = 5.02 C s = 0.045; K = 0.0051 M = 0.0032; P = 505.62 Q = -59079.4; t = 97.89 r = 23.76; a = -0288; y = 1688 et la f.d.p. est : f(x) = H (x + 0.288) 22 \" 76 (5.02 -x) 73-126   Finalement, a l'aide des tables de la fonction beta (Pearson & Hartley, 1969), on obtient: QlOO = 3662.1 m 3 s _1 QlOOO = 3915.2 m 3 s _1 QlOOOO = 4151.5 m 3 s-1 Ces quantités, pour un choix des stations figurent sur le Tableau 1.\n\nLa difficulté principale d'application de cette méthode en est une de précision. Normalement, les valeurs de t ainsi calculées sont assez grandes et le terme (b -x) t_ r-l j figurant dans la fonction beta, dépasse bien souvent la capacité des ordinateurs. Ainsi, il est convenable de moduler l'échantillon en divisant toutes ses valeurs par sa moyenne. L'emploi des tables de la fonction beta est très pratique excepté dans le cas ou r -1 < 0 car alors, le point inférieur a est une asymptote et les quartiles devront être calculés par intégration numérique.\n\nOn a calcule aussi les quartiles supérieurs de la fonction beta avec d'autres hypothèses de départ. Tout d'abord, on a considéré fixe la limite inférieure a, égale à la valeur la plus petite de l'échantillon. Les résultats figurent sur le Tableau 2.\n\nEnsuite, on a estimé la valeur de la limite a, comme étant la valeur dépassée, le 99% de la fonction Pearson III ajustée d'après l'échantillon (Tableau 3). al.

Siddall (1983) a développé un algorithme, basé sur le principe de Jaynes, pour estimer la fonction f(x) a partir des moments de 1'échantillon.\n\nNous avons utilisé la méthode de Siddall avec trois et quatre moments pour determiner les debits des stations, avec des périodes de retour de 1000 et 10 000 années. Deux hypothèses ont été considérées. Suivant la premiere, la valeur inférieure a est la valeur minimale X(l) de l'échantillon (Tableau 4), tandis que sous la deuxième, a est estimée d'après la loi Pearson III avec F(a) = 0.01 (Tableau 5).\n\nQuartiles de la fonction beta avec a = X(l)\n\nNuméro 090601 090602 092703 092704 092708 093801 a = X(l) 2010 1120 926 2100 521 778 Fonction 0.99 4921.14 3614.16 3534.52 7948.27 2031.54 2768.12 de distribu 0.999 5507.32 4036.70 4118.09 8916.07 2298.83 3205.10 tion: 0.9999 6673.97 4480.15 4982.66 10596.99 2792.05 3828.05 LES LOIS CLASSIQUES UTILISEES DANS LA CONCEPTION HYDRAULIQUE Les lois de distribution les plus utilisées de nos jours par les hydrologues pour le dimensionnement des évacuateurs, des ponts et des systèmes hydriques en général, sont les lois Pearson III, log-Pearson III et Gumbel. La loi de Pearson III est utilisée à cause de sa flexibilité. La fonction de densité est de la forme (Bobée & Robitaille, 1981): f(x ) = r x i • r x \" Y ) \"^r^ \" Y) i ; l ar((3) J l a J l a > (21) ou et al.

On pourrait donc dire que x suit une loi log-Pearson III lorsque lnx suit une loi Pearson III. La fonction de densité est de la forme suivante:\n\navec les conditions:\n\neY<x<+ cc et pour -l<a<0; 0 < x < e^ Quant a la loi Gumbel, sa popularité puise ses racines dans la décennie des années 40 alors qu'elle fut la première approche analytique au problème de l'évaluation des valeurs extrêmes (Chow, 1964).\n\nLa fonction de densité à la forme:\n\n)/ c -e -(a+x)/C (23) ou -°° < x < °° ; a = yC -x avec y 0.57721 (constante d'Euler);\n\nd'événements extrêmes 85 /6 C = -S (x).\n\nII existe une limite supérieure au volume et à la pointe des crues. Les conditions météorologiques qui régissent la formation des averses, de même que celles qui gouvernent la fonte de la neige, ont toutes un seuil supérieur qui entraîne l'existence de limites physiques pour la pluie maximale et la fonte rapide de la neige (Gagnon et al., 1970). Le principe de la crue maximum probable CMP consiste à maximiser les conditions météorologiques qui affectent le bassin versant étudie et à déduire la valeur de la CMP à l'aide d'un simulateur hydrologique du bassin versant.\n\nDeux approches sont généralement utilisées afin de maximiser les conditions météorologiques. La premiere méthode élaborée par Hershfield (1961) ajoute à la valeur moyenne annuelle des pluies maximales quotidiennes observées, quinze fois la valeur de 1'écart-type de ces mêmes données.\n\nLa seconde méthode dite \"physique\" utilise à la fois la transposition de conditions météorologiques extrêmes observées sur des bassins versants adjacents et la maximisation des averses en fonction du contenu en humidité des masses d'air. Cette dernière information est tirée d'un sondage aérologique ou à défaut, à partir du point de rosée de surface après avoir supposé un gradient adiabatique sature.\n\nLes valeurs disponibles de la CMP proviennent d'études reliées à des projets hydroélectriques d'envergure donc des bassins versants importants. Sur de tels bassins et dans les conditions géographiques du Québec, ce sont les crues printanières qui produisent les pointes maximum. Il est donc nécessaire d'étudier les conditions météorologiques critiques du printemps d'où les chutes de neige maximales par la méthode des saisons synthétiques. Cette méthode regroupe en une même saison, les chutes de neige maximales observées de périodes consécutives, quelle que soit l'année. La période utilisée ne doit pas être trop courte afin de respecter l'indépendance temporelle nécessaire. Une seconde méthode qui permet d'obtenir la limite maximale physique de la chute annuelle de neige utilise le principe des averses maximisées comme pour les précipitations sous forme de pluie.\n\nLa pointe des crues maximum probable est tirée de récents rapports techniques sur l'aménagement de systèmes hydroélectriques au Québec.\n\nLe Tableau 1 donne la pointe printanière de la CMP et la provenance de l'étude pour les bassins intermédiaires considères.\n\nPour les besoins de l'étude, il faut posséder à un même site, une et al.\n\nsérie hydrométrique la plus longue possible et la valeur de la CMP.\n\nComme les valeurs de la CMP dont nous disposons sont relatives aux emplacements d'ouvrages hydroélectriques qui ne coincident pas nécessairement avec les stations hydrométriques, la CMP a ete évaluée a ces stations par transposition.\n\nA partir de l'information des 22 valeurs de CMP et des bassins de drainage correspondants, deux regroupements relatifs a des conditions climatiques distinctes ont ete identifiés: le groupe 1 appartient à l'ensemble de la côte Nord (régions 05 et 07 de Menviq) et le groupe 2 à la Baie James (region 09 du Menviq). Pour chacun de ces groupes, les relations entre la pointe de la CMP et la superficie du bassin de drainage ont été établies de la manière suivante:\n\nGroupe 1: Q =6.33 S 0 ' 76 ou S = la superficie du bassin de drainage en km , et Q = la pointe de la CMP en m 3 s -1 .\n\nGroupe 2: Q = 5.11 S 0 ' 73\n\nLes coefficients de determination r sont de 0.99 pour le groupe 1 et de 0.94 pour le groupe 2, ce qui entraîne une transposition adéquate. Le Tableau 6 donne la priorité de la CMP aux différentes stations retenues.\n\nLe rattachement des stations hydrometriques a l'un ou l'autre des deux groupes a été effectué par proximité géographique; ce qui fut simple dans notre cas, car nous avions deux régions bien distinctes.\n\nLes pointes printanières des 22 stations-échantillons ont été tirées des annuaires hydrologiques publiés par le Ministère de l'Environnement du Quebec (Menviq). Les numéros de référence de ces stations sont ceux du Menviq. Les paramètres de l'échantillon sont donnés dans les Tableaux 6 et 7. Cet échantillon provient de stations dont le regime est naturel, a l'exception de la Sainte-Annedu-Nord a Saint-Fereole (051201), de la Sainte-Anne a Saint-Alban (050401) et de la rivière Aux Outardes à Chute-Aux-Outardes (071001) qui sont influencés par l'exploitation d'un réservoir mineur dans leur bassin. L'échantillon de la rivière Aux Outardes a été arrêté en 1967 avec la mise en eau d'Outardes 4, un reservoir majeur pour le bassin. En outre, les valeurs de la station 050403 ont été transposées a la station 050409 par la transformation suivante:\n\nX ( 764 } entre 1949 et 1964 ' ou l'exposant est tiré de l'étude régionale. d 1 événements extrêmes 87 ooooooooooooooooo o o o\n\nLes lois classiques (log-Pearson III, Pearson III et Gumbel) ont été ajustées sur chacun des 22 échantillons énumérés au Tableau 6. Au Tableau 8, nous présentons la valeur du débit décamillénale de chaque échantillon. TABLEAU 8 Debit dêcamillénal tiré des lois classiques Numéro Lois de distribution: 090601 090602 092703 092704 092708 093801 Gumbel 7697 5894 6239 13203 3133 4049 Log-Pearson 5285 3493 4769 7922 2525 2862 III Pearson III 5235 4108 4945 9362 2593 2629\n\nLes choix des résultats qui apparaissent aux Tableaux 1 a 8 inclusivement montrent que l'évaluation du débit dêcamillénal varie sensiblement d'une loi de distribution a l'autre. Ainsi dans la région 09, à la station 092703, le débit dêcamillénal obtenu par la 3 -1 loi log-Pearson III donne une valeur de 4769 m s alors que la distribution beta avec a estimée par la méthode des moments donne 7538 rn s -. Dans la région 07, la crue décamillénale de la station 071001 donne 3508 m 3 s _1 et 9319 m 3 s _1 pour les lois log-Pearson III et beta a _ momen -t; respectivement et enfin, dans la région 05, la station 050903 donne 95 m 3 s _1 et 363 m 3 s _1 selon que l'évaluation de la crue décamillénale est extraite de la loi log-Pearson III ou beta a _ momen -t. Il semble que l'estimation des debits extrêmes avec la loi beta, où le paramètre a est estimé par les méthodes des moments, pose un problème de surestimation. Le seul fait de définir ce paramètre a comme étant égal au débit dépassé 99% du temps de la loi Pearson III ramène l'estimé du débit décamillénale à des valeurs sensiblement plus faibles; ainsi, la valeur de 7538 m 3 s -1 de la station 092703 est ramenée à 4813 m 3 s _1 , de même la station 051001 passe de 9319 m 3 s _1 à 4057 m 3 s _1 et finalement la station 050903 de 363 m 3 s _1 à 134 m 3 s _1 . Ces dernières valeurs se rapprochent des estimés obtenus par les lois classiques; de plus, comme on l'a déjà mentionné, la loi beta donne une estimation qui est rattachée a une borne supérieure.\n\nLa Fig.l permet de visualiser l'ensemble des résultats. Elle permet a la fois de comparer l'estimation du debxt dêcamillénal a une station et le comportement de l'estimation en fonction de la superficie des bassins versants. On note que les courbes n'existent que pour les lois possédant un nombre de points suffisant.\n\nDans l'ensemble, la loi beta avec le paramètre a estimé à partir d'une distribution classique se situe sous la distribution Gumbel\n\n100 000 10 000 1 ooo loo 100 000 10 000 ooo : r ^ 2* r 3 1, S 4 > » R:(iKN 09 \" < X © * Courbe Courbe Courbe Courbe Courbe 1 2 3 4 5 K O + X o x CMP Gumbel Log-Pearson III Pearson III Beta Entrepie Max 100 100 10 000 1 000 100 10 10 000 , Superficie km 100 000 : ' <' t RE Gît '.

La courbe beta est aussi parallèle à la courbe CMP, ce qui est souhaitable, alors que les lois classiques ne le sont pas. La région 05 est particulièrement révélatrice puisque l'estimation du débit décamillénal dépasse rapidement la valeur CMP si on extrapole a de grandes superficies de bassins versants (2000 a 2500 km ) a partir des lois classiques. La loi beta présente ce problème pour des surfaces nettement plus grandes (4000 km 2 ). Il est bien entendu hasardeux d'extrapoler a des superficies à l'extérieur du domaine de nos échantillons.

Analysis of various schemes shows that these schemes tend to put more emphasis on individual physical processes than to address the actual phenomenon involving the mutual interactions between the hydrologicai and geomorphological characteristics and the drainage network structure. An analysis of the physical milieu defining the drainage network structure has been carried out showing the interconnections between the various ordering schemes. This approach paves the way for understanding the hydrologicai response of the network structure at the basin scale.\n\nLe rôle de la géomorphologie quantitative dans la réponse hydrologique des réseaux de rivières RESUME Bien que beaucoup de projets de réseaux de drainage basés sur la méthode de l'ordre d'un cours d'eau (Horton) aient été mis au point et utilisés pour beaucoup d'études, on n'a vu apparaître jusqu'ici aucun modèle particulier qui réponde aux influences complexes des variables déterminantes du climat, de l'hydrologie, de la couverture végétale et des caractéristiques des sol. L'analyse de différents projets montre qu'ils tendent à souligner avec insistance les processus physiques individuels plutôt que se mettre à examiner le phénomène réel qui comprend les réactions réciproques entre les caractéristiques hydrologiques et gêomorphologiques et la structure du réseau de drainage. On a effectué une analyse du milieu physique qui définit la structure du réseau de drainage. Elle démontre les communications réciproques entre les plans d'ordre différents. Cette démarche ouvre la voie a la compréhension de la réponse hydrologique à la structure du réseau de drainage à l'échelle du bassin. 93 NOTATION A n mean area of basin of order n D drainage density H n mean drop, or fall, of stream of order n L n mean lengths of streams of order n a n = ^n/^n m link order n order of basin or stream segment N n number of streams of order n fi highest order of a drainage network Q n mean discharge of stream of order n RA basin area ratio defined as AJJ+I/AJJ R b bifurcation ratio defined as N n /N n+ i R L stream length ratio defined as L n+ x/L n RQ discharge ratio defined as Q n +l/Qn R w slope ratio defined as S n /S n+1 S n channel of stream slope defined as DNJJ/LJJ V coefficient of variation of mean annual flood (daily) discharge V 0 coefficient of variation of mean annual discharge n 0 = Qm/Qo Hi = Vm/Vo\n\nThis paper attempts to review critically some of the basic concepts underlying the interaction of quantitative geomorphology with hydrology at the basin scale, introducing some of the unresolved problems posed by recent advances in this area of activity. The ordering schemes often used have passed through the traditional concepts of river networks (Horton, 1945) through systems development (Strahler, 1952;Rzhanitsin, 1960) to structural or link ordering (e.g. Shreve, 1967). Basically these schemes should reflect the changes in the physical characteristics controlling the natural flow processes as the network develops. Although, the elementary basin of first order is defined identically in all the schemes, the relative weight of mutual interactions between the morphometric, hydraulic and hydrological processes in the river network finds different expressions with each ordering scheme. The Horton-Strahler approach represents a rather morphological concept of form as opposed to the more process oriented scheme of Shreve. Analysis of the various geomorphological forms of the IUH (Rosso, 1984;Rodriguez, 1984) reveals the dependence of the hydrological response on the Hortonian characteristic ratios, which in turn vary with the ordering scheme. Due to the erratic nature of upland streams, and the absence of spatial scale in the various assessment schemes, presupposing a general homogeneity in the river basin may not be valid in nature. Presently, the problems posed by the interaction between planform and altitude remain unresolved both in form-form and form-process analysis (see e.g. Gupta et al., 1986), especially necessary in sediment transport if a unit sedimentograph is possible. Even though the various stages of the network development are supposed to evolve under diverse physical mechanisms (Abrahams & Miller, 1982), most attempts at probability distribution frequency analysis on network parameters, lump network links together into external and internal ones. Finally some preliminary results of analysis on the river networks of Ghana (Andah, 1983) and Italy are presented to illustrate some future perspectives and the impact of these results on energy distribution in stream networks.\n\nIn order to establish the basic characteristics of streams and channels, follow their changes from small streams to larger rivers (i.e. from streams of lower orders to those of higher orders) and the mutual interaction between them, it is necessary to sufficiently and clearly define the basic concepts underlying the river network structure. These principles controlling the formation and the behaviour of drainage network structure can be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) The river network is the product of the development of a physico-geographical process, and at the same time, a factor influencing the further development of this process.\n\n(b) Delineation of the basic phases and types of the water regime conforms with and is defined by their origin.\n\n(c) There exists a basis for territorial-geographic links in the formation of surface runoff with climatic factors.\n\nThe basis of the quantitative description of the form and process of the drainage basin network and their interrelationships was first introduced by Horton (1945) when he proposed empirical relations between landform characteristics and the controlling variables of climate, hydrology, vegetation and soil properties. These relationships were expressed through the hierarchical structure of the stream network, referred to as \"stream ordering\". The stream order expresses in quantitative terms the level of magnitude in the drainage network hierarchy. Among other explanations of the physical significance of stream order Rzhanitsin (1960) showed graphically that there are points of leap-change in the values of drainage area per unit length of channel, as a function of the number of channels and he characterized them as points of change in stream order. Furthermore, Yang (1971), considering the drainage basin analogous to a thermodynamic system, followed the distribution of entropy along the river network and concluded that for any drainage basin in dynamic equilibrium, the ratio of the average fall between any two different stream orders in the same basin is unity.\n\nThese observations show that the stream order is not an artificial classification or subdivision of the network as it may seem, but rather it reflects the ratio between soil erodibility and the eroding force, in the form of runoff or discharge, exerted on the soil surface. The change in stream order therefore reflects a sudden change in the physical characteristics relating the form and the process taking place in the basin as the network develops. Any given stream order can be characterized by a system of morphometrical, hydrographical and hydrological parameters (Rzhanitsin, 1960;Andah, 1983).\n\nFrom the foregoing analysis, it must be emphasized that the traditional delineation of a river network into a main river, into which flows an uncountable number of tributaries must give way to a al.\n\nsystems appraisal of the drainage network. It is in this context that Horton drew an almost erroneous conclusion to his brilliant work on stream ordering. Even though Strahler (1952) modified Horton's conclusion, the traditional concept on river network still persists (Schumm, 1956;Shreve, 1974;Jarvis and Sham, 1981). In nature, the river network structure is a vivid example of a system structure defined by its boundaries, mass and energy balance. From a systems point of view, in a river network there cannot be a main river with tributaries; every river as it flows from its source to its mouth changes its physical characteristics.\n\nThere are presently various schemes of stream ordering, attributed mainly to Horton (1945), Strahler (1952), Rzhanitsin (1960), Shreve (1964), andScheidegger (1966). The basic principle of stream ordering introduced by Horton states that: \"if two streams of the same order, V n , merge, the resultant stream has an order higher by unity\", i.e.\n\nV , = 2 * V\n\n(1) n+1 n\n\nAs stated elsewhere, Horton concluded by extending the highest order of the network upstream through the path of least deviation, thereby assigning the resultant main channel with the same highest order. This, in physical terms, means that the main channel from the source to the mouth maintains the same physical characteristics. Strahler (1952) modified this conclusion of Horton by assigning the highest order to only the point of change of the order and hence for the first time introduced a new understanding of the development process of the network hierarchy. The ordering scheme introduced by Shreve (1967) is fundamentally different from the Horton-Strahler scheme. It is basically process-oriented and generally referred to as magnitude or link ordering, in which stream magnitudes are equal to the number of external links or sources. For example, if a stream of first order flows into a stream of fifth order, the resultant stream attains a higher order of six. Rzhanitsin (1960) proposed an ordering scheme in which both commutative and associative effects of merging streams are taken into consideration. This scheme differs from that of Scheidegger (1965) which actually negates the sequence of the merging streams and thereby contradicts systems understanding of river network development. In the case of Rzhanitsin (1960), for example, if two second-order streams flow consecutively into a third order stream, the water content of the resultant stream increases to a value equal to the merging of two third-order streams and the resultant order should therefore increase to four, i.e.\n\nGenerally most of the ordering schemes can be represented symbolically as below:\n\nAnalyses of the above expressions indicates that their differences are basically due to the level of emphasis placed on the physical milieu of the drainage basin. At the same time, all the schemes tend to an elementary stream referred to as a stream of first order or external link, defined as an unbranched stream into which no other stream flows. Comparative analysis of the Horton-Strahler scheme with that of Shreve reveals two extreme physical processes, mutual in essence, namely geomorphological and hydrological respectively. The purely geomorphological approach underplays the role of cumulative or associative effects of streams of lower order in the hydrological characteristics and can therefore be referred to as channel or valley ordering. On the other hand, the purely hydrological approach does not consider the mutual interactions between the morphometrical and hydrological characteristics of the channels and hence physically signifies an ordering of streamflow amounts. The physical significance of the Rzhanitsin (1960) proposal can be seen as an attempt at considering the cumulative effect of streams of lag orders on the mutual interaction between the channel and streamflow processes defining the natural flow regime. The obvious problem inherent in this approach is the determination of the truncation level of lag effect, such that the cumulative effect of streams of lower order could produce a change in the physical characteristics of the natural flow process equal to the merger of two streams of the same order. This approach can be referred to as hydrogeomorphological since it reflects more on the basic principle underlying the structural and hydrological formation of river network.\n\nThe most important contribution of Horton to the development of quantitative analysis of drainage network was his very important formulation of the network structure that there is an orderly development of the geometrical qualities of a drainage system.\n\nHorton introduced three basic laws of drainage network composition, i.e. the change in stream numbers, mean stream lengths and mean channel slope are in geometric progression with stream orders.\n\n(a) The Law of stream numbers:\n\nThe Law of stream lengths:\n\nThe Law of stream slopes: S = S /R n 1 w Schumm (1956) further added corresponding laws for drainage areas :\n\nFurthermore Rzhanitsin (1960), Hirsch (1962), Stall & Fok (1967) found similar relationship between discharge and stream order:\n\nMany other forms or combinations of drainage basin characteristic have also been found to respond to the basic geometrical relationship (e.g. Rzhanitsin, 1960;Fok, 1971;Andah, 1983).\n\nThere have been many attempts toward quantitative analysis of non-homogeneities inherent in the spatial processes occurring in the drainage basin due to climatic, soil, topographical and other conditions influencing the natural flow process. The presence of these heterogeneities in the runoff formation from overland flow through the hillslopes up to the basin response rules out the feasibility of a single channel equation to describe the streamflow processes at the outlet of the basin. It is in this context that efforts have been made to describe runoff formation at different scales, namely hydrodynamic, hillslope and the more practical and physically significant, the basin scale (e.g. Kirkby, 1978Kirkby, , 1985;;Rodriguez-Iturbe & Valdes, 1979;Gupta & Waymire, 1983). The main characteristic which signifies the spatial distribution of the channel network in a basin is the drainage density, D. The basic principle is that amongst the assemblage of subnetworks within a drainage basin, the spatial scale at which the value of D is invariant, is the basin scale. Due to the uncertainties involved in topographical maps and also map scales, Gupta et al. (1986) introduced a new form of the drainage density D m (h) using a link ordering with respect to altitude. Accordingly, the drainage number density is defined as the ratio:\n\nwhere N(h) and A(h) denote the number of links in an interval around an altitude h and the basin area enclosed within the interval defined by order m respectively. A basin at the basin scale in this context is defined to be homogeneous if the drainage number density does not vary with altitude, i.e.\n\nIt must be noted that the concept of basin scale is not tied to the size of a basin, but rather to the size of an area within which a basin possesses an identifiable channel network which governs runoff generation from a system of hillslopes. A basin scale, therefore, is a spatial scale within the drainage basin at which the collective description of runoff generation from the system of hillslopes and its transmission to the basin outlet through the channel network, can admit simple descriptions by averaging out complex physical processes involved at the hydrodynamic and hillslope scales.\n\nEmpirically Andah (1983), Andah & Rosso (1984), in an analysis of the river network of Ghana confirmed the above conclusions. This work involved a water resources assessment of river networks of Ghana, with areas ranging from 800 to 397 000 km , using ordered topographical maps at the scale of 1:250 000.\n\nThe results to be later discussed in more detail, indicated a change in the regression of stream length on order at the sixth order, creating two distinct values of the stream length ratio RL. More interestingly, the Volta River basin of maximum order of fifteen also had only one point of change at the sixth order. Preliminary results of an on-going work by the authors involving the Fontanabuona basin in Italy at the scale of 1:25 000 shows a similar change, but at the fifth order.\n\nFurthermore, Coffman et al. (1971) carried out an analysis of ordered thresholds from the relationship between the number of links and the number of segments of natural drainage network in the form of a theoretical general equation:\n\nwhere Y is the number of links, X is the number of segments and n is the Strahler stream order. They found out that all networks up to the fourth order fall within their respective threshold fields with those above the fifth order not conforming to their respective threshold boundaries. These observations amongst others (e.g. Schumm, 1956) offer the possibility of delineating within the drainage basin two distinct geomorphological homogeneities, namely hillslope, and channel dominated processes. Much more analytical work is needed to confirm such preliminary results which could introduce a physically based concept into the search for a basin scale.\n\nThe basic principle underlying geomorphological approaches to water resources assessment of drainage networks can be stated as follows: \"if the river network is the final link of a definite physico-geographical process of mutual interactions of climatical, hydrological and geomorphological factors, and definite laws can be observed within its structure, then sufficiently strong relationships must also exist inbetween the morphometrical elements of the channel, the hydraulic and hydrological characteristic of the flow, the character and the structure of the drainage network\". The early works of Horton (1924Horton ( , 1932) ) in their original formulation of basin morphometry were partly carried out with a view to deriving a hydrological method by which discharge events could be predicted for ungauged rivers.\n\nThe most widely used approach is the multiple regression technique, in which regression equations are developed between basin form variables and some selected basin process indices (Leopold & Maddock, 1953;Benson, 1964;Trainer, 1969;Orsborn, 1974;Caroni et al., 1985). For example, Morisawa (1959) suggested a general functional relationship between streamflow Q and basin form parameters such as total stream length, basin area, first order stream frequency, stream gradient, circularity and relief ratio in the following form:\n\nand actually developed corresponding empirical solutions. Other indices of discharge (e.g. lag time) have also been related to basin morphometrical characteristics with some success (e.g. Kennedy & Watt, 1967;Quimpo, 1983;Mimikou, 1984). The enormous work produced in this sphere cannot be reported here since this paper intends to put more emphasis on the Hortonian stream-order approach to drainage network assessment. There are two wide approaches involved in the Hortonian techniques, namely, empirical regression analysis of actual observed data with stream order, and processresponse analysis based on the geomorphological structure of the drainage basin.\n\nIn this approach, attempts are made towards establishing a system of drainage basin characteristics namely hydrographical, morphometrical and hydrological for each stream order. A successful result can create a basis for predicting flow at ungauged sites, on the basis of either regional or single-basin data transfer through the use of a single index -the stream order.\n\nSome results of an earlier work by the authors (Andah, 1983;Andah et al., 1984;Andah & Rosso, 1984) are briefly reported here to show that in spite of uncertainties involved in the quality of observed data, stream ordering techniques could provide some reliable predictions of streamflow. Topographical maps of all river network of Ghana at the scale of 1:250 000 were used in establishing the stream orders, taking into consideration the cumulative effects of lower orders of merging streams up to lag two (Rzhanitsin, 1960). On the basis of drainage patterns with respect to basin relief, river networks of Ghana were grouped into three types, characterized by the transition from hilly areas to flat plains (Andah, 1983). As regards the hydrological regime, the river basins fall into two main types, referred to as \"Northern\" and \"Southern\" rivers. The northern rivers, lying in the northern savannah zone, are characterized by unimodal distribution of annual runoff. The southern rivers, lying in more humid and hilly areas and covered mainly by forest, experience two runoff peaks.\n\nThe main hydrographical characteristics considered were river lengths, stream lengths, stream drainage areas and the stream area/ length ratio. From Fig.l, it can be observed that the relationships of stream lengths and stream drainage area/length ratio with stream order change at the sixth order, except for streams in flat plains (type III) in the case of area length ratio. The respective characteristic ratios are reported in Table 1. These observations show that the hydrographical characteristics are dependent on the physico-\n\nVariation of hydrographical characteristics with stream order for relief type I, II and III and Fontanabuona.\n\nTABLE 1 Hydrographical characteristics of rivers of Ghana Relief type Characteristic ratios: R-R* an 1st order values: L (km) 1 (km) a (km) I II III 1.58 1.35-1.58 1.73-1.33 1.58 1.26-1.90 1.78-1.29 1.57 1.15-1.90 1.33 3.76 2.66 0.40 8.91 6.30 1.58 13.70 10.70 10.96 *The first value is associated with stream orders from 1 to 6 and the second from 7 to 14. geographical conditions of the drainage basin, especially on basin relief.\n\nThe hydrological characteristics considered are the mean annual discharge, Q 0 , the mean annual flood (daily) discharge, and their respective coefficients of variation V 0 , and V m . The relationship of discharge characteristics with stream orders obtained for the two water regime types are shown in Fig. 2, and Table 2. In the case of V Q and V m , there was a larger scatter in their relationships due to uneveness in observation periods, and as such, more work is being carried out. Since generally there are fewer gauging stations on upland streams, the behaviour of the hydrological characteristics for streams of lower order could not be actually established but for TABLE 2 Hydrological characteristics of rivers of Ghana Water regime type Northern Southern Characteristic ra R QO 2.13 2.06 Qm DO 1.85 0.87 1.80 0.87 tios : R -, r\\l 1.03 0.97 1st order values: Q o 0.06 0.08 Q m 2.00 1.50 \\ 30.0 19.0 n 2 0.84 1.48\n\nthe purpose of handy predictions could be extrapolated from graphical relationships. The combination of the hydrographical and hydrological characteristics obtained through a single network index (order) could be used to predict runoff for any project site, especially for prefeasibility studies.\n\nWhen compared with traditional regression analysis of hydrological variables versus basin area, altitude, mainstream length and slope, and similar global catchment parameters which are used as independent variables, one can observe that regional analysis based upon stream ordering seems to provide better results as far as the reliability of the estimates are concerned. In fact, the power equations which are usually fitted by the first method can provide unbiased and minimum variance estimates if the range of the gauged rivers under examination is considered. But highly biased estimates can be sometimes found when the power equations are used to extrapolate ungauged rivers. The estimates obtained by Hortonian regression analysis are usually affected by larger variance within the range of the gauged rivers, but they generally provide much more robust predictions within the extrapolated range.\n\nThis is a brief account of preliminary results of on-going research in a basin in Italy being carried out by the authors. The Fontanabuona River basin of drainage area 364 km 2 lies in the northeastern part of Italy. It is characterized by mountainous terrain of maximum altitude 1500 m a.m.s.l. with a mean value of 545 m. Three main basin characteristics are considered, namely morphological, hydrographical and hydrological. Stream orders were established by the schemes of Strahler and Rzhanitsin (with lag-one cumulative effect), using topographical maps at the scale of 25 000. The highest basin orders obtained were six and ten for the Strahler and Rzhanitsin schemes respectively. The hydrographical and morphological characteristics analysed include stream lengths, drainage areas, stream fall and stream slopes (gradient) and also their various interrelations. The relationships of the mean values of stream lengths and stream slopes with order changed at the fourth and fifth orders with respect to the Strahler and Rzhanitsin schemes. Further analysis with the Strahler scheme was discontinued since only one gauging station differed in order out of the existing four stations and would therefore not offer any appreciable relationship of discharge with stream order. The relationship and characteristic ratios reported in Fig. l and Table 1, respectively, refer to the Rzhanitsin scheme. It is interesting to observe that mean stream falls did not show any clear correlation with stream order. However, the mean stream falls seem to conform more with the postulation of Yang (1971) than the mathematically derived law of stream relief proposed by Fok (1971). Much more work is being carried out in search of a more conclusive analysis on this most important aspect of the interaction between the vertical and planimetrical scales of the drainage network.\n\nThe hydrological analysis include the mean annual discharge, various flow states of the flow duration curve (10, 91, 192, 274 and 350 days) and the absolute daily and instantaneous maximum flow values. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that apart from Q350 (not shown) all the other mean flow states fall into the same relationship with stream order, showing a constant mean discharge ratio of 2.75. The corresponding discharge ratios for the absolute values of maximum flows, both daily and instantaneous are 4.17 and 5.0 respectively. The values of discharge ratios reported here (Ghana and Fontanabuona) seem to indicate their tendency to increase from higher time averaged values to instantaneous rather than the flow states. The results of work being done to evolve a system of drainage basin characteristics that could give some guide to exploitable energy survey in river basins, if not absolute, at least in relative terms, for run-of-river plants are too preliminary to be reported here. Suffice it to say that the characteristics being analysed involve the stream area-length ratio as a benefit-cost index, the product of discharge with mean stream slope and mean stream fall. The general problem encountered in the form-process interaction can be found in the absence of hydrometrical stations especially in the upland sub-basins, making it difficult to proceed with strict phenomenological analysis of drainage basins.\n\nThe channel network within a drainage basin forms as a result of runoff generation and its subsequent transmission to the basin outlet. Recent developments in analytical models of drainage patterns (e.g. Cordova et al., 1982;Roth et al., 1985) show that the process of network formation over a loose boundary is governed by the climatic input, i.e. the rainfall intensity, for a given tectonic and soil constraints. Although these studies of processresponse characteristics are in their early stage of development, a close connection between climatic input and stream network as represented by its quantitative geomorphological description and runoff transportation at the outlet, has been observed both in nature and by controlled experiments (Roth & Rosso, 1986). This unique interconnection suggests that network geometry can provide the basic knowledge to analyse how and why a given network forms as well as the mode of response of a particular network to rainfall input.\n\nThe pioneering works of Rodriguez-Iturbe & Valdes (1979) and Gupta et al. (1980) provided firm arguments to support the identification of the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH), i.e. the basin response function to a unit input of rainfall excess, with the probability density function (pdf) of the basin holding time. Such an identification can also be extended to the concept of instantaneous unit response functions (IRF) to relax the linear assumption (see e.g. Wang et al., 1981;Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1982;Caroni et al., 1986). The importance of this identification lies in the proper theoretical setting it provides for a physically based analysis of the density of the basin holding time. In this context, the basin scale concept is approached from the random character of the holding time and of the interaction of various processes taking place at lower scales. Even though the equations governing the transport of water over land and in saturated and unsaturated soils are best understood at the hydrodynamical scale, the characteristics describing the network structure such as order ratios or link parameters are more meaningful at the larger basin scale and hence runoff produced by the basin should be represented at this scale.\n\nThe first\n\nmodel linking the IUH and network geometry, based on Strahler's scheme of network patterns was proposed by Rodriguez-Iturbe & Valdes (1979) within a mechanical statistical framework. Due to the simple characterisation of the drainage network, simple expressions of the IUH could be achieved. Moreover, Rosso (1984) has demonstrated that this model is equivalent to the Nash model (1959), the parameters of which are found to depend on the characteristic order ratios of the basin. Accordingly, the shape of the IUH can be determined from only catchment geomorphology, while the time scale of the IUH is the product of catchment geomorphology and streamflow dynamics. This latter aspect has recently been developed by Agnese et al. (1986) who derived a simple and straightforward approach to analyse the time scale of the IUH at the basin scale. Applications of this model, generally referred to as the geomorphological IUH, to different climatic and geomorphological conditions have been extensively carried out by various authors and the results generally are quite satisfactory for practical purposes, especially if one takes into account the uncertainties involved in parameter estimation of more complex models (Caroni & Rosso, 1986). Other areas where this model has found success in its applications are in frequency analysis (e.g. Hebson & Wood, 1982; Diaz-Granados et al., 1984) and in storm pollutant analysis (e.g. Marano & Rinaldo, 1986). Recent developments initiated by Gupta et al. (1980) have been directed towards linking the IUH with the basin structure, in order to provide a closer description of the process of runoff generation and flow than the one achievable by means of the Horton-Strahler scheme of network geometry. Although the manner of treating network geometry in these models subsequently required modifications (e.g. Gupta & Waymire, 1983), such approach has been shown to provide a flexible and meaningful representation of the hydrological response of a basin to an excess of rainfall over it. As compared with the first approach, the formulations which can be derived by the link structure relation to runoff generation and flow lead to more complex expressions. Nevertheless, this approach could allow a deeper insight of the process, since network and hillslope response functions can be identified (e.g. Gupta et al., 1986;Mesa & Mifflin, 1986) as well as the averaging properties of channel networks can be directly linked with the associated properties of flow hydrodynamics (e.g. Troutman & Karlinger, 1986).\n\nThe briefly discussed forms of the geomorphological models have been based on only network geometry. One can observe that gravity and for that matter altitude plays a relevant role in the generation and flow process and hence should be considered in modelling the hydrological response. A first attempt has been made by Gupta et al. (1986), who observed that a structural regularity among the runoff producing areas of the hillslopes does exist. In which case, the third dimension and more specifically, the drops in elevation among the channel links of the network should also be connected through some unifying principles. These principles can permit the postulation of energy considerations, dependent on the amounts of runoff produced by the hillslopes which are considered to be intimately linked with the drainage network. Under this viewpoint, Gupta et al.\n\n(1986) postulated that \"in the absence of geologic controls, the networks that form in nature have statistically independent link heights having an exponential density function\". As a result, the total runoff generated over a long time span by any sub-basin associated with each link of a basin has a gamma distribution with parameters X/y and 2*(link magnitude) -1, where X is the rate of exponential link heights and y is the runoff volume per link per unit elevation.\n\nIt can be observed that this result does not hold if X varies with altitude and as such the pdf of link heights play a dominant role in the assessment of basin runoff. In other words, a functional relationship of À with altitude would lead to a non-homogenous process of link development in the third dimension, while this process could be homogenous in the plane. Randomization of X, moreover, will lead to a double stochastic process of three-dimensional link structure, the effect of which will introduce a further fluctuation in the runoff production of a basin.\n\nAs further observed by Gupta et al. (1986), \"in searching for structural regularities between fluctuations in potential energy, kinetic energy and losses in channel morphology, it will be necessary to quantify the channel flow paths parameterised by altitudes\". Only after a suitable relationship between altitudes and flow paths is established and empirically tested, will it be possible to compute flows from a basin as well as to begin to address the fundamentally important problem of hydrological similarity among basins. Moreover the transformation of potential energy to kinetic energy appears to be tied to the interrelationship between the basin time-scale and spatial-scale.\n\nSince the introduction of quantitative geomorphology into river network analysis by Horton some forty years ago, there has still not emerged a basic understanding of the controlling geometry defining the network structure (see e.g. Strahler, 1952;Rzhanitsin, 1960;Shreve, 1967;Scheidegger, 1965;Rodriguez-Iturbe & Valdes, 1979;Gupta et al., 1980Gupta et al., , 1986 etc.) etc.). As shown by expression (3), the main problem involved in the search for an objective river network structure in nature is due to the contradiction between the superimposition of analytical models on the river network system and the actual physical processes generating and controlling the drainage basin. Even though the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme has been found on fundamental grounds to be inadequate to describe the river network geometry, the most preferred Shreve's scheme cannot also be adequate since it reduces the network structure to a simple collecting and transporting system of matter through the channels. A river network geometry in nature must of necessity be able to describe the various processes interconnecting climatic, morphological and hydrological variables. It is therefore necessary that analytical models must be geared towards the network structure in nature and not vice versa. In this case an attempt at bridging the gap between the rich store of empirical and analytical results already achieved would be in the right direction.\n\nThe best prospect for the application of the Hortonian analysis towards drainage network analysis and assessment lies with the fast advancing computer oriented Digital Terrain Models (see e.g. Clarke et al., 1982;Carrara, 1986) which would reduce the amount of work involved in the establishment of stream orders and measurements of various geomorphological characteristics. It is precisely due to al.\n\nthe tediousness of this approach that has limited most researchers to small subcatchments and also to schemes that are more mechanical in their use at the expense of the more objective form-processresponse reality of the drainage network.\n\nAbrahams, A.D. & Miller, A.J.

Multivariate extreme value distributions in hydrological analyses JOSE A, RAYNAL-VILLASENOR Engineering Graduate Studies Division, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 04510 Mexico, DF, Mexico JOSE D. SAUS Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA\n\nRecently, studies have commenced on the application of the multivariate approach to extreme value distributions towards its application for the solution of hydrological problems. The theoretical foundations of such an approach were made some 20 years ago, but they have had very little impact on the field of hydrology. In this paper, a classification of such models is made and in the particular case of the differentiable models, characteristics, properties and parameter estimation procedures for the method of maximum likelihood are given for the bivariate and trivariate distributions. Finally some applications of those distributions are described, mainly in the case of bivariate distributions.\n\nmultivariates des valeurs extrêmes dans les analyses hydrologiques RESUME Quelques études on été entreprises récemment sur l'application de l'approche multivariate a des distributions des valeurs extremes en vue de résoudre des problèmes hydrologiques.

Certain univariate distributions have arisen as particular solutions to the Stability Postulate, which any extreme must satisfy. Jenkinson (1955) found the general solution to the Stability Postulate, and some authors after him have called that solution the general extreme value (GEV) distribution. This distribution is able to represent the extreme value distributions of types II and III directly, and when one takes the limit of the shape parameter to zero, the result becomes type I extreme value distribution. An excellent reference on this topic is Natural Environment Research Council (1975).\n\nIn pioneer papers Finkelstein (1953), Gumbel (1958) and Tiago de Oliveira (1958) gave the foundations for the multivariate approach to extreme value distributions. After these works, several models for bivariate extreme value distributions began to appear in the literature. Two classes of them are now known: the differentiable and the nondifferentiable models. Among the latter class are (Tiago de Oliveira, 1982): the biextremal, Gumbel and Natural models.\n\nSince these models do not have explicit probability density functions, which makes parameter \"estimation difficult, and given that they have been developed for the particular case when both marginals are Gumbel distributions, they will not be described here any further. The reader is referred to Tiago de Oliveira (1982) for any additional details.\n\nThe only two known differentiable models for bivariate extreme value distributions are: the logistic and mixed models. Such names for the models have been coined (Tiago de Oliveira, 1982) from the fact that the reduced difference, when both marginals are Gumbel distributions, has the standard Logistic distribution in the first case. In the second case, the model has a dependence function coming from a mixture of such functions for the cases of dependence and independence, when the marginals are Gumbel distributions. General characteristics and multivariate extensions of these models will be given in the following sections.\n\nD.Salas model, he stated: \"The smaller variation of the correlation coefficient and of the distance shows that the deviation from independence is smaller and most difficult to detect\" . From these statements, the logistic model has been chosen, due to its greater flexibility and wider applicability, to be pursued further.\n\nFor the case of the logistic model for bivariate extreme value distributions, the following multivariate extension was given by Gumbel (1960b):\n\nand Tiago de Oliveira (1975a,b) provided the following inequalities for the model in equation ( 7):\n\nFor the case of bivariate distribution functions, the samples usually do not have an equal length of record, so it is necessary to have a formulation flexible enough to cover all possible combinations of arrangements of data. Such a formulation has been proposed by Raynal-Villasenor (1985) , based on the generalization given by Anderson (1957):\n\nwhere L(.) is the likelihood function of (.), n^ , n 2 , n3 are the lengths of record before, during and after the common period n 2 , respectively. Then s and t are the variables with records before and after the common period, respectively. 1^ are indicator numbers such that 1^ = 1 if n-^ > 0 and Ij = 0 if iij = 0. _9j_ is the vector of parameters.\n\nGiven the property that the maximum of a function and its logarithm occur at the same point and due to this fact the expressions provided by the logarithm of equation ( 10) are much easier to handle than those produced by such an equation, the log-likelihood function will be used instead of its natural version. So, equation ( 10) is transformed in, Raynal-Villasenor (1985):\n\nAn extension of equation ( 10) for the case of trivariate distribution functions is:\n\nand the corresponding equation to equation ( 11) for this level is:\n\nSince the parameter values which maximize equation ( 11) are the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of such distribution functions and given that equations ( 11) and ( 13) are very suitable for solution through optimization procedures, like the Rosenbrock method with multiple constrained variables, this is the approach employed to estimate the parameters of bivariate and trivariate extreme value distributions.\n\nFour main fields of application to multivariate extreme value distributions have been detected:\n\n(a) identification of the type of extreme value distributions, (b) improvement in parameter estimation, (c) transfer of extreme value information, (d) flood frequency analysis downstream of river junctions. They will be described as follows.\n\n(a) Identification of the type of extreme value distributions. Using the property of the logistic model that the difference is logistic distributed when both marginals are Gumbel distributions, the following identification procedure has been devised for extreme value distributions (Raynal-Villasenor, 1985):\n\n(i) estimate the parameters through a bivariate maximum likelihood scheme (equation ( 11)), assuming both marginals are General Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. This step allows the shape parameter to take any value and no specific extreme value s Jose D.Salas distribution type is assumed beforehand.\n\n(ii) test the difference against the logistic distribution. If the result is positive, then both marginals are Gumbel distributions. If not, continue to the next step.\n\n(iii) transform one at a time each of the variables to be Gumbel distributed, as suggested by the Natural Environment Research Council (1975) :\n\nwhere if x is GEV distributed, then y is Gumbel distributed. Then, perform the test contained in (ii). If a positive result is the outcome, then one of the marginals is GEV and the other is a Gumbel distribution. If not, continue to the next step.\n\n(iv) transform both marginals to Gumbel distributions according to equation ( 14) , and perform test (ii) . If the result is positive, then both marginals are GEV distributions. If not, the marginals cannot be assumed to come from the family of extreme value distributions.\n\n(b) It has been shown (Clarke, 1980;Rueda, 1981 andRaynal-Villasenor, 1985) that there exists an improvement in the parameter estimation phase, when the bivariate approach to distribution functions is used. Particularly, in the last two cases, related with flood information data, the improvement has been observed even in the case when both samples have the same length of record. As an example, Table 1  (Raynal-Villasenor, 1985) shows this condition. The measure of improvement is the relative information ratio, defined as (Raynal-Villasenor, 1985):\n\na ( e i,B> where I a (6i) is the asymptotic relative information ratio, var a (6^) and var & (6^ g) are the asymptotic variances of parameter 9 obtained through univariate and bivariate maximum likelihood procedures, respectively.\n\nThe trivariate extension for flood data and the whole procedure for drought data is under study and it will be reported elsewhere in\n\nTABLE 1 Relative asymptotic information ratios for the parameters of the bivariate GEV distribution (3j = -0.10, & 2 = -0.15 and m = 2.0) Parameter no + no: 25 50 75 100 «2 3. 1.03 0.95 1.01 1.03 0.95 1.01 1.29 1.13 1.13 1.01 0.94 0.91 1 .42 1.20 1.86 1.00 0.93 0.87 1.49 1.25 1.21 0.99 0.93 0.86 the near future.\n\n(c) Derived directly from what has been explained in the preceding point, it is possible, using multivariate extreme value distributions, to establish a transfer of extreme value data from gauging stations with a longer record to stations with shorter records (Raynal-Villasenor, 1985). Table 2 contains a sample of several stations that have been analysed, and it shows the number of years gained with this process of transfer information.\n\nThe trivariate extension for flood data and the process of drought data are under study.\n\n(d) Flood frequency downstream of river junctions has been attained only for the cases of complete dependence or complete independence, using non-parametric approaches (Salas, 1980;Linsley & Franzini, 1979). Using the multivariate approach to extreme value distributions, it is possible to provide an alternative method of modelling the physical process for the case of partial dependence. Such an approach is made assuming that the flood data gauged at stations upstream of the confluence may be used to represent what happens downstream of it. The form of the model is the well-known convolution equation for random variables (Woodroofe, 1975) :\n\nwhere F(t) is the probability distribution function of the flood data downstream of the confluence, and t represents the sum of two random variables, the samples of which have been gauged at stations upstream of the confluence. Raynal-Villasenor & Salas (1986) have analysed a case study of this kind and the results obtained proved to be satisfactory.\n\nThe multivariate approach to extreme value distributions has been presented as regards its application to the solution of hydrological problems.\n\nIt was shown that the use of multivariate extreme value distributions may improve the estimation of parameters of extreme value distributions. In addition to this feature, multivariate extreme value distributions provide a means for the identification of such distributions in the univariate form.

These models may be appropriate for forecast lead times which are short in comparison to the response time of the basin, provided slowly varying hydrological conditions are involved. However, if the transformation process from rainfall to runoff is described by an oversimplified approach, then the adaptive estimation of parameters may not be sufficient to correct for the unsuitable basic structure of the model. Recently, two simple models have been proposed by Corradini et al. (1986) and Corradini & Melone (1986). These models, designated henceforth as the RS and CM models, respectively, provided reasonable flood predictions for a large basin with mean lag time of 18 h and forecast lead times up to 6 h. Both models consider variability in space of rainfall and losses and incorporate the updating of flow forecasts at each time step, substantially through the correction of one parameter involved in the description of losses.\n\nIn this paper these two models and the unit hydrograph based adaptive model proposed by Chander & Shanker (1984) are applied to actual events and an analysis of the change in model reliability with the increase in its complexity is presented. For each rainfallrunoff event in each model, particular emphasis is given to the estimation of the variability in time of the adaptive parameter. This variability, which indicates the role of adaptiveness in relation to that of model structure, is considered in comparing the potential of the models.\n\nSince a detailed description of the RS and CM models can be found in the references cited previously, we provide here only a short account of their main features.\n\nA given basin is described as an ensemble of spatially uniform zones defined by isochrones of travel time from the outlet and determined by the Laurenson (1964) technique. Flow forecasts are performed, after the first rise in the observed hydrograph, assuming that no effective rainfall occurs beyond the time origin of forecast and by adding baseflow and direct runoff. Baseflow, B, is assumed equal to the value of flow observed earlier than the first rise in the hydrograph. Direct runoff is computed by representing its generation from effective rainfall in terms of the Clark translationrouting procedure, which involves the determination in advance of the basin concentration time and the storage coefficient of a fictitious reservoir (Linsley et al., 1982).\n\nThe mean areal effective rainfall depth at the discrete time k is derived through the difference of the area average of rainfall and losses. For the latter, the distribution in space, at each time step, is assumed proportional to rainfall and the evolution in time of the mean areal value is represented by the (f>-index approach. Forecasts of flow, Y^ , are performed on-line at a time b for lead times t'-b as:\n\nwhere R k is mean areal rainfall depth, U k denotes the basin response to unit depth of mean areal effective rainfall and I b represents mean areal depth of losses in the period ranging from the beginning of the first rainfall producing direct runoff to the current time b.\n\nIt is computed by:\n\nwhere Y b is the observed flow at the time b. Equations ( 1) and ( 2) are used if I b £ R^ for each 1 £ k é b, otherwise they are modified on the basis of the condition that effective rainfall is not negative.\n\nAs the event progresses, the estimation of losses is repeated at each time step and the flow forecast accordingly updated. We point out that at the time b + 1 the ordinates of each response function U k , for 1 £ k é b, do not change.\n\nThe major loss in the model is assumed to be infiltration. It is derived by a point infiltration model (Smith & Parlange, 1978;Smith & Hebbert, 1979) which is based on the description of the pre-ponding and post-ponding stages. The first stage, with no effective rainfall, is defined through the time to ponding computed in each homogeneous zone as :\n\nwhere the index i indicates a quantity referred to as the i-th homogeneous zone; t'^ is time to ponding; R^ is rainfall depth at time k; rp^ denotes rainfall intensity at time to ponding and S and K s are the sorptivity parameter (related to initial soil moisture content) and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, respectively, both considered invariant throughout the basin. In the post-ponding stage, soil infiltration rate at discrete time k, fj, provided rainfall intensity r^ 5 f k , is derived as the solution of the implicit equation:\n\nwhere At is the computational time step. Effective rainfall depth, for k > t'. , is computed as (r^ -f*f) At. However, if periods with V k P rf < fv-are involved, then a scheme with a complete balance of the infiltration water lacking during these periods is considered in computing effective rainfall. Furthermore, the computation of effective rainfall requires the estimation in advance, through calibration events, of K g and the optimal estimation in real time of S, denoted by S b . The parameter S b is derived by a trial-and-error procedure, with an objective function expressed by the sum of the squares of the errors on direct runoff for the last two discrete times prior to the forecast. In addition, in the same time interval a comparable trend for computed and \"observed\" direct runoff would be required. The flow forecast is then carried out as:\n\nwhere C denotes a runoff scaling factor given by the ratio of computed and \"observed\" direct runoff at current time b, and X indicates the basin response associated with the effective rainfall at time k. After the first time of flow forecast, as the event progresses, it is assumed S b = S b_1 and C b is computed. Then the flow forecast is updated provided 0.7 < C b £ 1.3, otherwise a new optimal estimation of S is performed and the forecast of flow accordingly corrected.\n\nThe Upper Tiber River basin with a drainage area of 4147 km was used for analysing the performance of the models. The basin, located in the Umbria region (central Italy), is characterized by complex orography. The topography is mainly hilly with mountain peaks over a large portion of the basin boundary. The soil is generally made up of clay and sandy silt and the underlying bed is practically impervious rock. Floods are normally caused by widespread rainfall in the autumnwinter period. The annual average precipitation over the basin, mostly in the form of rain, ranges from 700 to 1600 mm.\n\nThirteen rainfall-runoff events with hourly data were utilized a this study. Five events were used for estimating the parameters prior to testing. The estimated parameter values were time of concentration 17.6 h, storage coefficient 11.2 h, and saturated hydraulic conductivity 0.4 mm h~ . Eight isolated events were employed for testing the models. These events, observed in the period 18 December 1981-24 March 1983(Corradini & Melone, 1986), 3 -1 were characterized by peak flows ranging from 323 to 843 m s and baseflows ranging from 39 to 135 m 3 s~ .\n\nApplications of the RS and CM models to the events of the prediction set were carried out in conjunction with those of the unit hydrograph adaptive model (Chander & Shanker, 1984) whose initial delay time was estimated to be 7 h (Corradini et al., 1986). The behaviour of the RS and CM models was practically similar for a forecast lead time, L up to 6 h. Specifically, as summarized in Fig. l, for L = 6 h a reduced increase in model accuracy was found using the CM model instead of the RS model, with average values in the peak flow error (in magnitude) of 9.3% and 12.9%, respectively. However, the unit hydrograph method produced very large errors with an average value of 63.5%. These results were also confirmed by an analysis of the shape characteristics of the curves predicted. A sample event illustrating the differences in the predicted hydrographs is shown in Fig. 2 where it can be seen that the unit hydrograph based model is substantially less accurate than the RS and CM models.\n\nI200-800-400-6~i 0 0 ft/© A* 0 o. 0 y? • 0 / X I ' I 400 800 1200 Observed flow (m 3 s -) )\n\nRelationship between forecast and observed peak flow for all the events of the prediction set.\n\ntics of the curves predicted. A sample event illustrating the differences in the predicted hydrographs is shown in Fig. 2 where it can be seen that the unit hydrograph based model is substantially less accurate than the RS and CM models. if the model is perfectly suited. Although the CM model considers, in the adaptive scheme, a combination of the two parameters S and C, however, useful information about the model structure may be obtained (Corradini & Melone, 1986) by considering only the variability of the parameter S provided it is estimated at the time of each flow forecast. We analyse the variability of each parameter in each event through the width of its range of values referred to as the mean range value. The evolution in time of the adaptive parameters is shown in Fig. 3 for a sample event. It can be seen that the variability of I, for the RS model, and c[>, for the unit hydrograph based model, is similar, while the variability of S is not directly comparable with that of these two parameters. Thus, in each event, the variability in infiltration depth, £2(S), produced in each homogeneous zone by the variability of S, was computed. As a representative example, we provide for this quantity the results obtained in the largest homogeneous zone. For the eight events of the prediction set, the following extreme values were computed for the ranges of I, <}) and U(S) : 10-95%, 5-90% and 15-45%, respectively, while corresponding average values of about 55%, 50% and 30% were derived.\n\nAs supported by the analysis of the evolution in time of the adaptive parameters, in addition to the computed accuracy in flow forecasts, the CM model seems to be substantially more appropriate than the RS model for further developments of the modelling investigated here.\n\n(b) The RS model could be usefully employed for on-line flood forecasting in view of its ease of application. However, on the basis of the wide range of variability computed for (j) and determined by the simplified representation of the processes involved, the model should be tested on a wide variety of basins.\n\n(c) The unit hydrograph based adaptive model represents an over-simplified approach for real-time flood forecasting in large basins. Adaptiveness is usually not sufficient to correct for the synthetic representation of the rainfall-runoff process.\n\n(d) Simplified semi-distributed models have much to offer for future flood forecasting schemes in areas where data may be limited.\n\nAn evaluation of parsimonious stochastic models for runoff forecasting and simulation in tropical environments, Zambia T, C, SHARMA Department of Water Affairs, PO Box 772,Maseru 100,Lesotho ABSTRACT The ability of the univariate stochastic runoff model comprising of harmonic and/or autoregressive moving average components, and discrete dynamic lumped linear rainfall-runoff (bivariate) model was examined for forecasting and simulation of runoff sequences in Zambian drainage basins. The study revealed that the bivariate model and also the univariate runoff model appeared satisfactory for one-month-ahead adaptive forecasting. None of the models under consdieration showed promise for simulating the monthly runoff sequences due to poor preservation of the correlation structure. However, the univariate model provided reliable results for simulating yearly runoff sequences.\n\nZambia.\n\ncopper, cobalt, and zinc), farms (Nakambala Sugar Estate etc.) and important industrial plants (Kafue Textiles, Nitrogen Chemicals, Bata Tannery etc.) are situated in the basin. The major hydroelectric plant of Zambia at the Kafue gorge site (Fig. l) is run by the River Kafue. Plans are being implemented to develop 100 000 ha for agriculture in the basin so there is increasing and conflicting demands for water for the various applications. Thus there is a need to evolve suitable policies for optimal allocation of water resources to the various users in the basin. The setting warrants accurate inventories being made of available surface water resources and their temporal variations, and suitable algorithms being developed for forecasting the river discharges, preferably on a monthly scale in order to assist in allocating the river water to the various competing users. Mathematical modelling of runoff processes provides one way of estimating the temporal variability of river discharges through simulation and forecasting river flows.\n\nAttempts were made to model the monthly and yearly runoff processes based on the concepts of univariate (runoff series) and bivariate (rainfall-runoff series) parsimonious stochastic models. The notions of the harmonic functions, ARMA (autoregressive moving average) modelling and lumped linear dynamic input-output modelling were used. The models so developed were evaluated for their ability and adequacy stochastic models for runoff 131 in runoff forecasting on a monthly basis and in simulation of monthly and yearly runoff sequences.\n\nThe Kafue basin is drained by the Kafue River and its tributaries, the Lunga being an important one (Fig. l). The Kafue River joins the Zambezi River after passing through the headwater regions in the Copperbelt, the Kafue flats in the central region and the Kafue gorge in the lower region. Mean annual rainfall in the basin varies from 900 to 1300 mm south to north. Most of the basin lies at an elevation of from 1000 to 1300 m a.m.s.l. The terrain ranges from undulating to flat but includes hills. A feature of the basin is the Lukanga swamps (area 2500 km ) and certain other marshy lands known as \"dambos\" which have peaty soils that form 12% of the basin. In the northern part of the basin, where the rainfall is high, soils are leached and sand veldt occurs. These are sandy to medium textured soils. Moderately fine textured reddish soils occur in the regions between Lukanga swamps and the Kafue hook bridge. The vegetation consists of woodlands (mainly Brachystegia and Combretum) or bush with a varying density of grasses on drier land. Much of the land is suitable for grazing and cropping.\n\nThe surface water resources of the basin have been developed for hydroelectric generation through the construction of the Kague gorge and the Itezhi-tezhi dams (Fig. l). The hydroelectric generation plants are located at the Kafue gorge site whereas the necessary storage is provided by the Itezhi-tezhi dam, nearly 400 km upstream of the Kafue gorge site. The portion of the basin between the Kafue gorge and Itezhi-tezhi dams is characterized by flat lands (area 7000 km 2 and a gradient of 0.002%) and is known as the Kafue flats. The drainage area of the basin upstream of Lake Itezhi-tezhi at the Kafue hook bridge site is close to 93 952 km . The total drainage area of the basin up to the confluence with the Zambezi River is about 150 000 km 2 .\n\nThere are eight gauging stations in the basin with fairly good quality data spanning more than 20 years and 13 rainfall stations with good quality daily records exceeding 30 years. Monthly and annual rainfalls were abstracted from the publications Monthly and Yearly Rainfall Totals published by the Department of Meteorology, Zambia. Monthly and annual river discharges were abstracted from the Hydrological Year Books published by the Department of Water Affairs, Zambia. The areal estimates of monthly and yearly rainfall depths were obtained through arithmetic averaging of rainfall depths from the raingauge stations. The runoff data from the eight gauging stations were used for model fitting and evaluation of the fitted models for forecasting and simulation. However, to save space, the results are being reported for only four stations (Table 1). The first two stations (4-090 and 4-130) possess data for 20 years and, therefore, are used for forecasting, while the other stations (4-200 and 4-669) covering longer periods of nearly 28 years are used for simulation. A hydrological year in Zambia begins in October and ends in September.\n\nO 00 Os I co un \\ CM un Os AI 0 0 S3 4J tO ai 3 tu tO ai tn t) •H h •M CM un os co Os •s Os SO so 1 \\f ls< cq tS t)\n\ntO -e-\n\nIt has been shown by Sharma (1985) that the monthly and yearly rainfall sequences in the Aambian environments tend to obey the normal probability law and the runoff sequences the lognormal probability law. Therefore, the log transformed version of the runoff sequences was modelled through the univariate and bivariate models as follows:\n\n(a) The logarithms of monthly runoff discharge sequences in the basins were modelled through a linear additive model comprising periodic and stationary stochastic components. The periodic component consisted of the first two harmonics of the annual cycle, with an explained variance ranging from 60 to 75%. The stochastic component was represented by an Autoregressive Moving Average ARMA (1,1) process with an explained variance ranging from 15 to 30%. The combined harmonic and ARMA (1,1) model explained more than 90% of the variance in the process, leaving less than 10% as the random component in the monthly runoff process.\n\nThe model components can be written as follows:\n\nin which q p t = the l°g s °f the monthly discharge sequences of month t in the year p; mt = the periodic component with t taking values from 1 to 12; A Q , A's and B's are harmonic parameters; Zj's = stochastic dependent variâtes; a-^ ' s = random variâtes with mean zero and variance s2 <j), = autoregression parameter; and 8^ = moving average parameter (Table 1). (b) The logarithms of the yearly discharge sequences in the basin followed the autoregression relationship:\n\nin which Q^'s = logs of yearly discharges in the sequential years; Q = mean of the Q^ sequences. (c) A first order linear discrete model represented adequately the dynamic interaction between monthly rainfall depths (x.^) and logs of monthly runoff depths (yi). The bivariate model structure copsisting of five parameters explained more than 90% of the variance of the monthly runoff process, leaving 10% as the random element. The model contains first order memory terms in the output (y^) as well as in the input process (x^) and can be written as: y. -v, y. ., = c + w x. + w x. _ + a.\n\n(5) l 1 J x-1 o l i l-l l in which y i 's = sequential values of logs of monthly runoff depths (cm); Xj/s = sequential values of monthly rainfall depths (cm); v l. c > w o> w l = system parameters (Table 1).\n\n(d) A first order linear discrete model with a memory in the output process adequately represented the dynamic interaction between yearly rainfall depth (X-^) and logs of yearly runoff depth sequences (Yi). The bivariate model consisting of four parameters can be expressed as Y -V..Y. \"=c+w X.+a.\n\nin which Y-^'s = sequential values of logs of yearly runoff depth (cm) sequences; X^ = value of yearly rainfall depth (cm); v^, c, w 0 = system parameters (Table 1). The model explained variance ranging from 40 to 90%. The details on the fitting of these models are described in Sharma (1985).\n\nThe forecasting algorithms for one month and several months ahead for univeriate runoff model equations (l)-(3) were adapted from Box & Jenkins (1976). The bivariate rainfall-runoff model, equation ( 5) was used to forecast the runoff discharges of future months using mean rainfall depths for each month. The value of the component a i was regarded as zero in the process of forecasting. Equation ( 5) offers simple recursive relationships and, therefore, forecasting can be made by knowing the initial values of the needed input and output variables.\n\nSimulations of the monthly and yearly discharges through use of the univariate stochastic model were carried out using equations (1)-(4). A sequence a^ containing 100 values was generated using the relationship a^ = s a .zj in which z^ = sequence of standard normal deviates with mean zero and unit variance. A z^ sequence was generated using an HP97 pocket calculator. The initial value of Qi-1 in equation ( 4) was taken as equal to Q. The monthly and yearly sequences so obtained were exponentiated in order to obtain the actual runoff sequences. The statistical parameters viz. mean, coefficient of variation, skewness coefficient, and lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient were computed from the exponentiated sequences.\n\nThe simulation of the monthly and yearly runoff discharge sequences through use of the bivariate rainfall-runoff model was carried out by generating monthly (x^) and yearly (X^) rainfall depth sequences and a^ sequences. The generation of an xi sequence was carried out using the relationship x^ = s x . ZJ + x in which s x and x denote the standard deviation and the mean of an XJ sequence, respectively, and z± is the standard normal deviate with a mean of zero and a variance of unity. A z^ sequence was generated as mentioned above. It should be noted that the yearly and monthly rainfall sequences tend to obey the normal probability law and persistence in these sequences is negligible. One hundred values each of monthly (yi) and yearly (Y^) runoff depths (logarithms) were generated. The values of y i or Y^ obtained above were exponentiated and transformed into discharges (m 3 s -1 ). The statistical parameters viz. mean, coefficient of variation, skewness coefficient, and lag 1 autocorrelation were computed from these generated sequences. stochastic models for runoff 135\n\nThe univariate stochastic model was used to forecast monthly discharges for a lead time of 12 months. The forecasting was based entirely on the past behaviour of the runoff and no regard was taken of the causative factors. The bivariate rainfall-runoff model was used to forecast the discharges using mean rainfall depths for each month. Yearly runoff discharges were also computed by summing these forecast monthly discharges. The forecasted and observed runoff discharges are shown in Fig. 2. One can see that forecasts based on the bivariate rainfall-runoff model are closer to the observed sequences in relation to the univariate stochastic model. However, .

The reliability of these models for adaptive forecasting on a one-month-ahead basis was investigated (cf. Box & Jenkins, 1976). In the bivariate rainfall-runoff model the observed rainfall depth and discharge for the current month were used to forecast the adaptive runoff discharge for the next month. Mean monthly rainfall was used as an estimate of rainfall for the month for which rainfall is yet to be observed. The results based on adaptive forecasting are displayed in Fig. 3. It can be inferred\n\n12 MONTHS AHEAD FORECASTING OBSERVED UNIVARIATE MODEL BIVARIATE MODEL 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 MONTHS FIG.3 Forecasting of monthly discharges for Smith Bridge station in the Kafue basin.\n\nfrom these figures that the bivariate rainfall-runoff model offers a better fit than the univariate stochastic runoff model, whereas both results are acceptable. The bivariate model structure is simple, it contains four parameters (vj_, c, w Q , wj_) and provides reasonable estimates of forecast discharges. The univariate stochastic model can be used for adaptive one-month-ahead forecasting in the situation when no rainfall data are available, though the model requires eight parameters (A 0 , A^, A2, Bj_, B2, <j>i, &±, s a ) . None of the above models seemed adequate for forecasting 12 months ahead.\n\nThe statistical parameters obtained from the simulation exercises are displayed in ).<.

The performance of the model appeared poor in preserving the lag 1 autocorrelation and skewness coefficient (Fig. 5).\n\nThe bivariate rainfall-runoff model appeared satisfactory in preserving the mean, but not so satisfactory in preserving the coefficient of variation. The preservation of the lag 1 autocorrelation and skewness coefficient was equally as bad as that of the univariate runoff model. Of special mention is the poor preservation of the first order (lag 1) autocorrelation coefficient in the discharge sequences of the individual months. The simulated sequences tended to behave as a set of random events, whereas significant carryover effects were evident from the historical sequences (Fig. 5). Yet the preservation of the first order carryover effects was better performed by the univariate runoff model than the bivariate rainfall-runoff model. The aforesaid univariate and bivariate models were also used to simulate yearly runoff discharges through summation of the generated monthly values. The computed statistical parameters of such simulation (Table 2) indicate a serious discrepancy between the autocorrelation structure of the historical and simulated yearly runoff sequences. The simulated yearly sequences tended to be random, whereas historical sequences display persistence trends. At this stage it was considered desirable to compare the serial correlations between successive months using all the months under consideration. It was found that serial correlations, particularly for months June to October, were stochastic models for runoff 139\n\n00 103, 00 M< Cl ^ o vo O O M 1 00 Ol •* CO O M< O «3 K O O t-| CM 1 CO 00 o o VO Q ^ ic (»•> ko <--i r-. \"O O O H 00 10 204. cri in O 00 CM ^ CM O M *tf co LO O 00 o in M 01 01 CI t\\ N •sf \"s* 00 O O O Vu o-, CM 00 In ** CM O O in CO M _^ Q Q CM 1 ^ v -• O EH \"C S! \"U En ^ û. s: fe o H Es ^ h C0 ai f-H 01 01 .i « CO js R <B QJ s:\n\nM tr> ns tH CM O M +J R QJ -H 0 ;^ Hs fH <u 0 0 w 10 QJ R 3: QJ -M CO\n\nhigher than 0.94 in the historical sequences, whereas they were less than 0.84 for these months in the simulated sequences. In other words, the simulations of autocorrelations and serial correlations by the models were poor.\n\nThe simulation results indicate that the parsimonious stochastic models studied here had limited potential for simulating the monthly discharge sequences. Similar simulation studies for Australian streams substantiate these findings (Srikanthan & McMahon, 1982). In the hydrologie literature (Thomas & Fiering, 1962) univariate stochastic models have been resorted to for simulating the monthly discharge sequences. Such models require a large number of parameters and yet difficulties have been encountered in simulation (Singh & Lonnquist, 1974;Srikanthan & McMahon, 1982). Singh & Lonnquist (1974) suggest a two distribution method for improving the Thomas-Fiering procedure for modelling and sequential generation of monthly streamflows. Srikanthan & McMahon (1982) suggest a two tier model proposed by Harms & Campbell (1967) as an extension to the Thomas-Fiering model. Bivariate rainfall runoff models for simulating the monthly runoff sequences have been applied by Bonne (1971). Bonne (1971) developed bivariate models for consecutive pairs of months, thus requiring a large number of parameters. The reliability of such bivariate models was found satisfactory. However, Bonne's observation indicates that the reliability of simulated flow records hinges greatly on the right choice of the frequency distribution of the rainfall and runoff sequences for the months under consideration.\n\nA.comparison of statistical parameters for the simulated sequences with those from the historical ones (Table 2) suggested that the univariate model equation ( 4) does a better job of simulation than the bivariate rainfall-runoff model, equation ( 6). The bivariate runoff model yielded higher values of mean, coefficient of variation and skewness coefficient, though the values of lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient were comparable. In general, the skewness coefficients of the simulated sequences were higher than those of the historical sequences. This may not be regarded as a discrepancy because of the uncertainty involved in the estimate of the skewness coefficient from the small sample size of less than 30 years of historical data.\n\nSince the first order and the second order moments compare well using the univariate stochastic model, the model can, therefore, be prescribed for simulation of the yearly runoff sequences. It is to be noted that the univariate stochastic model referred herein is essentially a Markov model. The use of the Markov model for simulating annual discharge sequences is well documented in hydrological literature Fiering & Jackson, 1971;Srikanthan & McMahon, 1980).\n\nThe following conclusions are in order based on the present study : (a) The bivariate monthly rainfall-runoff model consisting of first order memory terms in the runoff and in the rainfall processes appeared reliable for one-month-ahead adaptive forecasting. The univariate parsimonious model consisting of harmonic and ARMA (1,1) components must be ranked second. None of these models appeared reliable for 12-months-ahead forecasting.\n\n(b) Neither the univariate stochastic model nor the bivariate rainfall-runoff model provided a reliable simulation of the monthly discharge sequences. Major discrepancies were encountered in simulating the correlations in the flow sequences of adjacent months (serial correlations) and among the runoff sequences of a particular month (autocorrelations). However, the univariate model containing eight parameters preserved means and coefficients of variation better than those provided by the bivariate model consisting of five parameters.\n\n(c) On a yearly basis the univariate stochastic model showed promise in simulating the yearly runoff sequences.\n\nA hydrological network based on an instrument for automatic time-variable data acquisition\n\nHEINZ BERGMANN & THOMAS ZEYRINGER Institut fur Hydromechanik, Hydraulik und Hydrologie, Technische Universitat Graz, Mandellstrasse 9, A-8010 Graz, Austria ABSTRACT Time constant data acquisition usually allows only inexact data sampling, or sampling with a high volume of storage, depending on the time interval used.\n\nThe method of time-variable data recording uses only the points of time with relevant information, thus increasing resolution and decreasing storage demands. It has been applied since 1979 both for rainfall and runoff gauges in the Pollau experimental basin and provides a completely automatic way of data acquisition by a microcomputer system. It is not only possible to use the continuous time series for numerical investigations both in time and space, but this sampling technique also allows the analysing of events and the use of their information as inputs for forecasting and other models. Regional networks can be established and used as sub-information for larger drainage basins. The information stored in a data base can be linked and provides large time series with high resolution by the method of time-variable data recording.\n\nEquipement de réseaux régionaux basé sur l'enregistrement automatique, a pas de temps variable, des données RESUME Normalement, l'enregistrement avec pas de temps constant permet de recueillir seulement des données imprécises ou exige un volume énorme pour ces données, suivant le pas de temps utilisé. La méthode de l'enregistrement a pas de temps variable utilise seulement les instants où l'information est importante, augmentant ainsi le pouvoir de résolution et diminuant les besoins de mémoire. La méthode a été appliquée à partir de 1979 aux 10 pluviographes et aux trois limnigraphes dans le basin expérimental de Pollau et offre ainsi un moyen complètement automatique pour enregistrer les données avec l'aide d'une système de micro-ordinateur. Il est également possible d'utiliser la série chronologique pour des nombreuses recherches dans le temps et l'espace d'analyser les événements et d'utiliser l'information qu' ils fournissent comme entrées dans la prévision et dans d'autres modèles. De cette manière il est possible de créer des réseaux régionaux qui peuvent fournir des informations complémentaire pour des bassins plus étendus. L'information enregistrée dans une base de données peut être groupée et elle fournit ainsi de longues séries avec une haute précision par la méthode de l'enregistrement à pas de temps variable.\n\nHydrological data acquisition is usually based on the measurement of discrete values at constant time intervals. In this way, an image of the hydrological regime of a basin at the time of measurement can be obtained -a snapshot. The time structure of the hydrological events is obtained by adding an appropriate number of consecutive images. The time resolution of this event depends on the chosen time interval. It is commonly known that it is inexpedient to choose the same observation interval for every relevant hydrological variable (WMO, 1969). Choosing a time interval which is too long does not provide the required resolution; choosing one which is too short increases the number of observations without a compensating increase in the information. However, choosing a universally appropriate time interval is very difficult. There is also the point that the time interval itself does not contain any information about the change with time of the natural process, this information must be obtained from the measurement variable changing with time. The problem is that the resolution is very small with large changes of the variable and almost useless with small changes or a constant state.\n\nIn the ideal situation the optimum level of information would be obtained by choosing the time interval corresponding to the time fluctuations of the considered variable, taking into account the capacity of the measuring equipment. In this case the exact point of time (year, day, second) must be recorded, after which the hydrological variable has increased or decreased with a constant value. This method of time-variable data recording is technically quite simple to accomplish and has the following advantages:\n\n(a) any resolution of the measured variable can be determined; (b) the time measurements possess the highest possible information contents with the lowest storage amount (applying to all instruments with the same recording equipment);\n\n(c) the time series of time intervals resulting from the measurements is a data base which can itself be used.\n\nTime-variable data evaluation is also suitable for synoptic investigations, because any time-constant evaluation is possible.\n\nIn 1979, the Institute of Hydromechanics, Hydraulics and Hydrology at the Technical University Graz, together with the Styrian Hydrological Survey, installed a research basin in Pollau/East Styria (Fig. l). This basin with an area of 58.3 km 2 is located in the eastern declivity of the Alps with an elevation range between 400 and 1300 m lying about 60 km east of Graz. It is also a sub-drainage basin for the River Raab, near the border between Austria and Hungary (Bergmann et al., 1982). The experimental basin is equipped with seven raingauges, three runoff gauges and a climate station. For recording precipitation, tipping bucket gauges are employed. The receiving surface of the\n\ntime-variable data acquisition 145 LEGEND HYDR. RES.

A new recording system is used, which does not record the sampled data by regular interrogation, but instead records the exact point of time of every tip of the bucket, equivalent to 0.1 mm. Thus, the amount of storage on the recording medium is reduced to a minimum; if there is no precipitation falling, there is no recording either (Bergmann et al., 1986). The first generation of instruments used magnetic tapes for recording. This had the advantage of storing data at rather low cost. But mechanical parts and bad blocks on the cassette frequently caused problems when interfacing the data units with the data processing system via a special interface. The second generation of instruments use a standard IEEE, or RS232, interface and a continuous random access memory of 32K, which allows storage of nearly a whole year's precipitation (about 800 mm). Also the mechanical parts, susceptible to defects, could be eliminated, allowing a quick, reliable method of data transfer. The new instruments also display the absolute time, so time checks can be made easily. These are especially important, because there might be natural hazards like lightning, which cause time lags, which then can be easily corrected by the microcomputer (Stubenvoll & Zeyringer, 1985). For this reason, calibration marks are recorded from time to time. After having been corrected by the offline computer system, the data can be stored on diskettes as base data files, which store all the data for a station for one year. The data consist of all the points for the absolute time of tipping. The second generation of instruments also allows the storing of analogue values, like temperature, in addition to the rainfall data, in time-constant form.\n\nThe availability of access to high-resolution data from different stations in a regional network at any time of the year not only allows statistical analyses over a long period of observations (like several years), but also permits instant access for short time events. So a time series can be used to calculate the return period of design events and to estimate maximum probable event characteristics, while the hyetographs can also be used for forecasting floods. However, the term \"event\" is defined in many different ways, and independent rainfall events may result in one overlapping runoff event, depending on storm velocity and direction, basin topography and soil characteristics. For the Pollau experimental basin an empirical approach to delimit independent rainfall events was determined by using the collection of variable time intervals At for one year for a given station (Bergmann & Stubenvoll, 1986). A time interval denotes the difference between two subsequent points of time when the bucket tipped, corresponding to a certain intensity. The distribution of the Weibull plotting positions yielded three divisions (Fig. 2): first, all time steps up to 30 minutes within an event; second, all time intervals between two rainfall events up to three days; and third, the dry periods. So, for the following investigations, a delimitation interval of about 2 h with no tipping of the bucket was used.\n\n99,95 99,5 95,0 -10,0 0,2 0,05 Automatic time-variable data acquisition 147 li//-\n\nEMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TIME INTERVALS AT it (mini 1 2 5 10 15 30 iHsec) 6 15 30 60 -50,0-• PRECIPITATION -/* <#>-/// /S.-'// 4 1 2 3 6 12 21, it(hr) 1 2 3 6 12 »Kd) i NERVALS BETWEEN ^ DRY P.

In order to represent an event in a time-free form, the intensity-mass-diagram (IMD) was introduced. The conventional intensity-time or mass-diagrams are replaced by the IMD, relating the intensity as a function of the precipitation height. The mean intensity of the IMD, the \"potential intensity\", has proved to be useful for classification of rainfall events in respect to time and space.\n\nSpatial distributions of the rainfall pattern over the drainage basin can be obtained by applying several grid methods with given point values (Bergmann & Zeyringer, 1986). The grid, containing 233 quadrants each with a length of 500 m, allows the representation of the precipitation pattern and its use for constant time steps to yield a time-space simulation of moving storms. Figure 3 shows the relation between the relative coefficient of variation of the 1 mm maximum intensity and the relative spatial coefficient of variation of the potential intensity. Thus, the potential intensity can also be used for spatial classifications of rainfall events. % I POT VAR. Discharge measurement is also based on the principle of timevariable data recording, storing every change of water level of plus or minus 1 cm.\n\nPneumatic gauges are used, and new methods like supersonic measurement (Klasinc, 1985) are being developed. Further, runoff events can be expressed in timeless form, although large variations of the duration seldom occur in runoff events.\n\nPOSSIBILITIES FOR EQUIPMENT OF REGIONAL NETWORK It has been shown that the method of time-variable data recording has proved to be applicable for high-resolution time-space simulation of precipitation in a drainage basin and thus is suitable not only for modelling runoff by basin variables, but also to give access to instant high intensity point hyetographs, which can be used as input information for flood forecasting models. Representative and experimental basins play an important role in the supply of information used in larger basins, where the accuracy both in respect to time and space is less sufficient, because the drainage basin is larger and sometimes the equipment costs only allow daily data sampling by an ombrometer. So, the accurate regional and the more inaccurate information of the whole basic can be combined by modelling precipitation or runoff. However, it will be necessary to equip the basin with new, accurate instruments for a proper simulation. Further, the instruments must be linked, forming a network with a central data base, where sub-drainage basins are linked by nodes. The transmission of the data can be accomplished by telephone, if the distance is not too long, or wireless communication, if no obstacles like mountains are disturbing the connection. Such a large scale regional network, for instance, will be set up in west Styria by the Hydrological Survey with a drainage basin of about 2000 km 2 and with about 25 automatic raingauges. The data will be transmitted by wireless to a central data base in Graz.\n\nIn future, formats for data transmission, data collection and storage will have to be standardized to allow interconnections between data bases of different basins for purposes of flood prevention, water supply, irrigation and other influences of man on the water regime. It will be important that the measuring systems for data acquisition will show high precision, and economically will contain optimal concepts and will use all the advantages of automation and transmission techniques. For this reason time variable data acquisition seems to be a suitable basis for the installation of regional networks. The time-variable measurement system allows the defining of the hydrological variables beforehand to any resolution, and yet it uses the minimum necessary storage amount in the equipment. Because only the point of time is measured when the variable changes for a certain value, the measuring set up (a quartz-based clock) and the data measured with it (day and time of day) are the same for all variables. This yields new possibilities for regional data acquisition and the evaluation of data. So, all data (time measurements) for a region can be transmitted by simple coded time signals from the instrument network to a central data station, where they can be corrected and stored in a suitable data base. By this means, hydrological information can be accessed in an easy and actual way by everyone interested in water management tasks. In future, the political, economic and administrative decisions will be based more and more on such scientifically based methods of collection and storage environmental information. This applies to both quantity and quality.\n\nFinally it should be stated that many developments will still be necessary to improve instruments, transmission techniques, data storage and methods of evaluation for the security of data and access to them. CONCLUSIONS Time-variable data acquisition is not only an alternative technique to conventional methods of data acquisition with constant time intervals, but has also a lot of significant advantages. The essential advantage of the time-variable method is that the resolution of every hydrological variable can be chosen beforehand. Not the variable itself, but the time of change of this variable is measured. This means that the time series of every hydrological variable is recorded by time measurement and herewith contains the same data base. This results in the fact that the measured value is displayed and transmitted as simple time signal and that the capacity of the recording medium is optimally used. And further, the unit time data base is of great advantage for the evaluation and access of data. This is especially significant when installing regional networks, because the coded time signal is the only discrete measurement value of the whole measurement equipment. This also facilitates the control and storage of data and the installation of data bases, which guarantee a quick access to actual information for every user.\n\nmeasurements.

In this way, 151\n\nthe stochastic nature of streamllow is introduced into the analysis (implicit stochastic model). A very important condition for this simulation is that the operating rules should not make use of the knowledge of future inflows which have been generated in advance.\n\nOptimization models, on the other hand, offer the possibility of finding an optimal operating rule and, usually, deterministic models with historical records are proposed (Yeh, 1985). The objective of the research presented here was to apply deterministic optimization models (dynamic programming) to synthetic records. Due to high cross-correlation among flow at different locations in the system, the Young-Pisano model (Young & Pisano, 1968) was used to generate 10 series of monthly flows (each 50 years long) at each location. The system with four multipurpose reservoirs was optimized using a physical objective function, namely the maximization of the minimum flow (low-flow) at a control gauge, subject to constraints on mandatory releases and flood control. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality, sequential application of the dynamic programming algorithm was performed. As a result, low-flow augmentation targets are obtained for each reservoir to be operated in a given sequence. The different standard operating rules thus obtained can be analysed with a multiobjective approach, in this case compromise programming, in order to choose the most acceptable rule.\n\nThe four reservoir system is shown in Fig. l, all are multipurpose and include low-flow augmentation at a control gauge (downstream of all four reservoirs) as a primary purpose.\n\nWUPPER RIVER ~~5 CONTROL GAGE A RESERVOIR RESERVOIR 1 BEVER 2 LINGESE 3 BRUCHER U WUPPER CAPACITY 10 6 m 3 23.7 2.6 3.3 25.9 BASIN km 2 25.7 9.1 5.8 119.9 MEAN INFLOW m 3 , s\" 1 0.70 0.26 0.16 3.12\n\nSystem of four multipurpose reservoirs.\n\nOther purposes such as flood control, through reservation of free storage space in some specified months, and mandatory releases for fish and wildlife are considered as constraints, and are thus not of optimization models 153 optimized here (see Table 1). Some recreation is provided in reservoir 1, which is taken care of by optimizing this reservoir first in the sequence. This reservoir is emptied only during very dry periods and is kept almost full in other, normal years.\n\nTABLE 1 Constraints on reservoir operation Reservoir 1 Bever 2 Lingese 3 Brucher 4 Wupper Dead storage (10 6 m 3 ) 0 0 0 2.1 Flood control reservation (10 m Nov.-Jan.

Cross-correlation was very high (r ^ 0.93), so that a multisite method was used (Young & Pisano, 1968). Monthly flows for a historical record of 32 years were available to determine the parameters of the flow generation model (equation (1)):\n\nl where Qi = vector of flows during month i at the five stations; A and B = matrices (5 x 5) of parameters (including autocorrelation and cross-correlations lag-0 and lag-l); = vector of five random numbers with independent, normal (0,1) probability distributions for month i. This model was in fact applied to the cube roots of the flows, which, from tests, had a probability distribution close to normal distribution.\n\nThe results show an acceptable variation in the statistical parameters of the synthetic records by comparison with the parameters of the historical records. For example, at the control gauge, six out of ten of the synthetic mean flows (numbered I through X) are larger than the historical mean, while four of the ten deviations are larger than the historical values. Figure 2 presents presents the historical mean, maximum, minimum and average value of the mean flows for the control gauge. Figure 3 displays similar results for the standard deviation of the flows at the control gauge. --HISTORICAL STANDARD DEVIATION MINIMUM OF 10 SYNTHETIC RECORDS AVERAGE OF 10 SYNTHETIC RECORDS MAXIMUM OF 10 SYNTHETIC RECORDS NDJ FMAMJ JAS0 FIG.3 Monthly standard deviation of flows at the control gauge.\n\nThe problem of dimensionality with four reservoirs (Hall & Dracup, 1970) was solved by using deterministic dynamic programming models for each reservoir in a sequence (Boehle et al., 1979). This is different to a single, individual reservoir optimization, since the results of the optimization of one reservoir (increased low flows) are used as input for the optimization of the next reservoir (i.e. flow to be augmented is now higher), The local optimum obtained was therefore very close to a global optimum (Boehle et al., 1981). This is due to high cross-correlation among monthly flows at different locations in the basin. The objective function of the dynamic programming algorithm is to maximize the minimum flow (low flow). The recursive equation for one reservoir in month i is thus: an example of a standard operating rule. This rule is variable from month to month according to Q ± (flow to be augmented).\n\nA simulation with this rule was performed instead of the usual forward-run of the dynamic programming algorithm in order to obtain the new flows to be augmented by the next reservoir (Harboe, 1983).\n\nThe targets obtained after the sequential application of the dynamic programming to each reservoir are included in Table 2 for historical and 10 synthetic records (I through X). The results with synthetic records show on average higher low-flow targets than with historical record. Some individual results are nevertheless lower than the ones with historical records. These results mean\n\nTABLE 2 records Results of optimization with historical and synthetic Hydrological Target (T) for low flow augmentation in [m s ] for: record Reservoir 1 Reservoir 2 Reservoir 3 Reservoir 4 Historical Synthetic 1 Mean of 10 Synthetic records I II III IV V VI VII /III IX X 2.50 2.68 2.60 2.56 2.41 2.71 2.94 3.15 2.62 2.74 2.52 2.69 2.65 2.83 2.74 2.84 2.79 03 14 19 83 97 2.73 2.91 2.83 3.07 2.92 .03 .95 .27 3.40 3.42 3.04 3.23 2.90 3.12 3.62 3.95 3.62 3.72 3.61 3.96 4.11 4.16 3.89 3.84 3.68 3.85\n\nUsing this Lp -metric, all objectives are first reduced to the interval (0.1) and the distance to an ideal solution is minimized. If the weights a^ and a 2 are chosen as equal (a^ = a 2 = 0.5), the results of Table 3 are obtained for the compromise programming metric L p (j) for different values of exponent p.\n\nTABLE 3 Results of compromise programming for different p-values Alternative operating rule (j) I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X Lp (j): p = 1 0.524 0.547 0.566 0.500 0.571 0.490 * 0.500 0.524 0.513 0.548 p = 2 0.383 0.494 0.433 0.500 0.429 0.447 0.500 0.370 0.366 * 0.451 p -*• °° 0.333 0.491 0.400 0.500 0.389 0.444 0.500 0.278 * 0.291 0.437 Low flow target (m 3 s~l) Z li 3.95 3.62 3.72 3.61 3.96 4.11 4.16 3.89 3.84 3.68\n\nFrom these results, the optimal operating rule for p = 1 has a low-flow target of 4.11 m s -1 , for p = 2 a target of 3.84 m s -and for p -»• °° a target of 3.89 m s . These results are also presented in Fig. 5, which shows that a very low security (20%) is attained if the optimal operating rule is chosen with p = 1. For p = 2 the corresponding security is 60% and for p = oe it is only 50%. Probably the best procedure would be to increase the weight (CI2) of the security objective (Z 2 ), after discussing the situation with the decision maker, or to choose operating rule IX (j = IX) since this one has the smallest Euclidean distance to the ideal point for equal weights (Fig. 5) CONCLUSIONS A methodology for finding operating rules for a system of reservoirs has been developed on the basis of the dynamic programming algorithm and on multiobjective analysis. The system of reservoirs can be multipurpose, but one of these purposes should be chosen as the main one (highest priority) and others should be considered in the constraints of the mathematical model. This is necessary in order to have a physical objective function of the max-min type. Under these circumstances, a sequential application of dynamic programming (one reservoir at a time) is possible. This procedure leads to standard operating rules whose targets are the result of the optimi-\n\nThe premise of this paper is that the behaviour of river systems is comparable to that observed in various other systems and it is proposed that future research should further explore this possibility of explaining river behaviour in a universal fashion. Scientists have shown that systems in fluid mechanics (Libchaber & Maurer, 1982;Gollub & Swinney, 1975;Giglio et al., 1981;Berge et al., 1980), chemistry (Roux et al., 1980;Hudson & Mankin, 1981;Simoyi et al., 1982;Pomeau et al., 1981), optometry (Arecchi et al., 1982), electronics (Testa et al., 1982) and biology (Guevara, et al., 1981) all have patterns of behaviour which can be explained by the theory of chaos (Feigenbaum, 1980). This theory is combined with the theory of minimization of internal entropy production (Nicolis & Prigogene, 1977) to explain the behaviour of rivers in a qualitative way. 161\n\nBasic principles regarding the theory of chaos are first presented; they are then combined with the theory of minimization of internal entropy production to explain river behaviour in a qualitative way.\n\nThe theory of chaos (Feigenbaum, 1980) will not be discussed in detail but its most important conclusions will be presented. Feigenbaum (1980) showed that the manner by which any physical system changes from stable to unstable conditions is universal and can be presented by a graph relating function value and a so-called nonlinear parameter (Fig. l). For values of the nonlinear parameter between a and b (Fig. l) the system behaviour will be such that it will always converge to a single function value.\n\nTransition from stable to unstable conditions in nonlinear systems.\n\nThis convergence is independent of initial conditions. If the value of the nonlinearity parameter however lies between b and c the function value of the system will oscillate between two values. This oscillation is also independent of starting conditions.\n\nBy increasing the nonlinearity parameter to a value between c and d, the system behaviour is such that the function value will fluctuate between four values. Consistent increases in the value of the nonlinearity parameter will result in the function value oscillating between 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. values. This binary progression in the number of function values will continue with increasing values of the nonlinearity parameter until a state of total chaos is reached.\n\nThe universality of this discovery does not only lie in the binary progression but also in parameter convergence and in the relative -^\n\nNon-linear parameter\n\nof successive branch splittings.\n\nvalue of x into equation (3). The value of f(x) is then used as the next estimate of x, the function value recalculated and the process repeated. For small values of R the function soon converges to a single value. By increasing the nonlinear parameter, f(x) will start to oscillate between two values, then four, eight, sixteen, thirty two, etc. The relationship between the values of R and the converged values of f(x) is shown in Table 1. This table clearly illustrates the binary behaviour of the system.\n\nTABLE 1 Relationship between nonlinear parameter R and converged function value f(x) for the equation f(x) = 1 -Rx R f(x) f(x) 0.7 1.0 1.31070274134 1.38154748443 0.678 0.000 1.000 1.000 -0.311 0.873 1.319x10' 1.000 -0.382 0.799 0.118 0.981 -0.329 0.851 2.000x10\" 1.3979453597 1.000 -0.398 0.779 0.152 0.968 -0.309 0.867 -0.050 0.996 -0.388 0 .789 0.129 0.977 0.334 0.844 0.004 a universal approach 165\n\nThe nonlinear parameter is also known as the dissipation factor, which in the case of non-equilibrium systems (such as rivers) may be replaced by internal entropy production. The latter can be related to stability of systems. Nicolis & Prigogene (1977) not only showed that internal entropy production is a minimum in stable linear systems but also indicated that the excess internal entropy production due to turbulent fluctuations is minimized when a nonlinear non-equilibrium system approaches stability.\n\nThis finding is in line with the theory of chaos which requires the nonlinear parameter to assume a minimum value for the system to be stable (Fig. l).\n\nThese conclusions are used to show that it is possible to explain the behaviour of river systems in a similar universal way.\n\nChannel patterns explaining river flow can for the purposes of this paper be divided into three categories, viz straight, meandering and braided channels. If these channel patterns are the result of natural processes it is usually found that straight channels are more stable than meandering channels and that both are more stable than braided channel flow. A qualitative relationship between channel patterns, relative stability and sediment and flow properties was proposed by Schumm (1981) . The interdependence of these variables is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThis relationship indicates, amongst other things, that stream power is low for stable channel patterns and high for unstable patterns. Stream power is an alternative means of expressing internal entropy production at a specified temperature (Annandale, Suspended Load Mixed Load Bed Load HIGH RELATIVE LOW STABILITY (3%<) Low -*-Bed Load/Total Load Ratio -High (>11%) Small -* Sediment Size *-Large Small -> Sediment Load *• Large Low -\" Flow Velocity *• High Low -« Stream Power *-FIG.4 Classification of rivet channels (Schumm, 1981).\n\n1984) and can therefore be used as nonlinear parameter in the effort of correlating the theory of chaos (Fig. l) with the observations of Schumm (1981) (Fig. 4).\n\nIf the measure of stability of a river is taken as the position of flow in the direction transverse to the general direction of flow, analysis of Fig. 4 indicates that low values of stream power are associated with a single stable value as a function of time; whereas high values of stream power are associated with unstable situations. This observation can be explained in a way which is similar to the progression of other physical systems by using the theories of chaos and minimum rate of internal entropy production.\n\nA comparison between Figs 1 and 4 shows that the stable straight river channel with low stream power is comparable to the function value associated with the nonlinear parameter values between a and b. This is the stable solution.\n\nThe river slowly starts to meander as the stream power increases and if the location of the river channel as a function of time is recorded at a particular transverse position the river channel can be considered to be oscillating between two points. This occurs due to meander migration which can be in the order of 760 m per year (Gregory & Walling, 1973). Such oscillating behaviour is comparable to the oscillations observed for other systems when the nonlinear parameter lies between b and c (Fig. l). The comparison can be carried through to high values of stream power associated with braided channels. This is comparable to a value e of the nonlinear parameter in Fig. l and can be regarded as a chaotic situation. Not only does the braided river have multiple choices of where to flow at a particular instant in time, but further instability is observed in lateral movement. The latter can be as much as 130 m per day (Gregory & Walling, 1973).\n\nThe stability and behaviour of river systems were explained in a qualitative manner by using the theories of chaos and minimum internal entropy production. In doing so it was qualitatively shown that river systems exhibit the same behavioural characteristics as other physical systems. It is recommended that further research towards better understanding of river behaviour be conducted in this field by applying the proposed theories.\n\nd'événements extrêmes\n\nCependant, le modèle univariant a fourni des résultats fiables pour la simulation des séquences d'écoulement annuel.
