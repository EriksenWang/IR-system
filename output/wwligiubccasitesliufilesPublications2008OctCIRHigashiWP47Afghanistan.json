    "full_text": "iii CIR Working Paper No. 47\n\nLegitimacy in world politics has been the focus of both global attention and scholarly study in recent years, yet its role in peacebuilding has not been well studied. It is often remarked in both public and scholarly discourse that legitimacy is critical for success in creating sustainable peace in war-torn states; Larry Diamond, a political scientist who worked as a political advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, asserts, \"the first lesson of America's experience in Iraq is that… any effort at administration and reconstruction of the post-conflict state must mobilize legitimacy, both internally in the post-conflict country as well as internationally.\" 1 It appears to be a widely shared understanding that it is imperative for peacebuilders to obtain or construct legitimacy in the eyes of local people and leaders. Surprisingly, however, the concrete methods or policies to obtain this \"local legitimacy\" in the host states have not been fully examined. The objective of this report is to address this critical question by examining key policies regarding legitimacy construction in the specific context of Afghan peacebuilding. I plan to conduct research with the same question in different peacebuilding cases; accumulated case studies, I believe, will demonstrate policy implications for both ongoing and future peacebuilding efforts.\n\nI wish to thank Carolyn McAskie, former Assistant Secretary-General for Peacebuilding Support, who introduced me and my research proposal to numerous UN peacebuilders and key officials in UN missions. In her letter, she endorsed my project as research \"which will shed much-needed light on an issue which perhaps more than any other affects the success or failure of international peacebuilding efforts.\" Yukio Takasu, the Permanent Representative of the Japanese Mission at the UN, and Kenzou Oshima, the former Permanent Representative of the Japanese Mission at the UN, also supported my research with written endorsements. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Afghanistan, and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) in Afghanistan gave me special cooperation to accomplish this research. I also appreciate cooperation by Japan embassy in Kabul, including Hideo Sato, the Japanese ambassador in Afghanistan. I sincerely thank precious advice from Fatemeh Ziai, the former acting director of the best practices unit at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and current director of the integrated training unit at DPKO. I am also extremely grateful to Dr. Richard Price, Dr. Katharina Coleman, and Dr. Brian Job for their academic supports and advice at UBC. Financially I deeply appreciate the Toyota Foundation, which funded my field research in Afghanistan and Timor Leste.\n\nI also would like to send my many thanks to all UN officials, officials in ISAF, and all Afghans who cooperated with my interviews. Thanks to their cooperation, I conducted individual interviews with over 50 international officials, several cabinet members of the Afghan government, 20 central government officials, over 40 local political leaders (such as provincial 1 CIR Working Paper No. 47\n\nThe purpose of this research is to address the question, \"what are effective policies for international and domestic peacebuilders to create domestic legitimacy in the process of peacebuilding?\" In other words, the research seeks effective policies for peacebuilders to create \"legitimate governments,\" under which a majority of people comply with the rules of government in voluntary mode. Legitimacy is defined as power to pull compliance in a voluntary mode, not by coercion. 2 In order to examine this question, I hypothesize five key factors that might have critical impacts on constructing the legitimacy of newly created governments in war-torn states; those five factors can be largely influenced by international actors who are involved in peacebuilding activities.\n\n(1) Role of the UN (2) Inclusiveness (Reconciliation) (3) Local ownership (4) Resource distribution (Peace dividend) (5) Use of force The hypothesis of my research is that these five factors influence the compliance or noncompliance with key political developments, such as elections, constitutions, and disarmament of military factions, which are key components in the peacebuilding process.\n\n2 Thomas Frank (1990) argues \"legitimacy exerts a pull to compliance which is powered by the quality of the rule or of the rule-making institution and not by coercive authority. It exerts a claim to compliance in the voluntarist mode.\"\n\ncompliance with these political developments will enhance the creation of legitimate governments; on the other hand, repeated noncompliance will erode the legitimacy of governments (see Appendix 2).\n\nIn my hypothesis, there is one intermediate factor between these five factors and compliance behaviors: the \"credibility as impartial,\" which peacebuilders should create and enhance. For example, when domestic factions perceive that peacebuilders are credible, fair, and impartial, it is more likely that domestic factions will participate in elections and accept their results, as they can perceive that their participation will be treated impartially, and their political rights will be protected even if they lose elections. Establishing \"credibility as impartial peacebuilders\" would be also crucial for disarmament of military factions. International actors might be able to play a central role in creating this credibility in wartorn states.\n\nBased on this hypothesis, I conducted field research in February 2008 (2 weeks) and May and June 2008 (6 weeks) in Afghanistan. I interviewed key international peacebuilders, such as the Deputy SRSG of UNAMA, the head of UNDP, the head of UNHCR, the head of WFP, NATO Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan, and numerous UN political officers both at central and provincial levels. projects that can be implemented within the DIAG budget ceiling to guide districts to make proper identification for the projects. b) Increase the staff to estimate costs of economic projects and implement them.\n\nDIAG started in 2005 as a program to disarm about 1700 illegal armed groups targeted by the Afghan government. In DIAG, if 75% of weapons are surrendered by commanders in targeted districts, the district is supposed to obtain development projects. That exchange of economic programs becomes a big incentive for commanders to surrender weapons.\n\nHowever, these development projects by DIAG are so slowly implemented that it continues to spread mistrust between the government and local political leaders. In Koh Band District in Kapisa Province, one year has been wasted just to select DIAG development projects after commanders surrendered more than 75% of weapons in 2007. The commanders in Koh Band were frustrated by the slowness of programs, perceived themselves cheated by DIAG, and started a commander union to oppose the government.\n\nThere are numerous cases in which DIAG wasted more than 4 to 6 months just to select the projects after commanders in districts fulfilled the goals of weapons collections. As for the overall picture, in 43 districts where the DIAG Joint Secretary asked MRRD to start DIAG economic projects, DIAG economic projects were completed in only 2 districts (as of 31 August 2008).\n\nThis slow implementation makes it more difficult for DIAG coordinators to persuade commanders in newly targeted districts, because commanders oppose DIAG by saying, \"We will not be cheated by DIAG.\n\nThere has been no implementation of projects in complying districts.\" One DIAG coordinator told me that this delay of implementation is about to kill the entire DIAG process.\n\nThe key failure is the process of choosing the development projects at the district level. It is mainly the District Development Assembly (DDA) that chooses DIAG development projects, and the DDA sometimes choose the programs from the list of District Development Plans (DDP), which are created by the National Area Based Development Program (NABDP) in MRRD. This process creates over-expectation by people because the DDP list of projects tends to have much bigger budgets than the ceiling of DIAG (150,000 USD per district) and cannot be implemented.\n\nThe \"DIAG concept paper\" clearly requests DIAG projects to be linked with existing programs such as NABDP. It says, \"The DIAG development component will be in line with existing development initiatives (such as NABDP)….it is envisioned that DIAG…would employ the NABDP project implementation structure for delivery of some of the community projects.\"\n\nThis practice represents the typical problems of legitimacy construction. The creation of over-expectation without clear explanation about the budget ceiling, as well as the lack of explanation about slow implementation of development projects, just keeps eroding the legitimacy of the domestic government and the international actors in charge of DIAG.\n\nThe lack of staff to implement DIAG development projects is also serious. It takes almost 4 months just to estimate the costs of identified projects, while it is possible to complete an estimate in one month in other programs. Thus, what often happens is that 4 or 5 months after commanders fully complied with DIAG weapons collection and DDA selected the projects, DDA members and commanders heard that the DIAG cannot implement the projects due to the budget ceiling. Because the MRRD tends to show the big-budget projects to give commanders incentive to release weapons, commanders and community leaders perceive they have been \"cheated.\"\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that a surprising majority of people in Afghanistan support the DIAG. According to my opinion survey, over 95% in Wardak and Kapisa and 80% in Kandahar support the idea that commanders should surrender weapons; they believe that only after illegal armed groups are disbanded can security in their communities be established.\n\nIt is critical for the DIAG Joint Secretariat and the MRRD to create a modest list of projects that can be implemented within the DIAG budget ceiling, distribute the list to every District Development Assembly (DDA), and ask them to choose the projects from the list. Proper identification of projects in the initial stage is critical; the projects might be modest, but it is crucial to implement projects very quickly so that it can enhance the trust in the government.\n\nIt is also urgent to increase the staff specifically for implementing DIAG economic projects; the budget of DIAG might be small compared with other MRRD projects, but because the program involves key commanders and community leaders, swift implementation is indispensable to maintain the government's credibility with local people and their leaders.\n\nIt is encouraging that both the head of UNDP, Anita Nirody, and the Japanese ambassador, Hideo Sato, recognize the criticality of this problem and have started making serious efforts to speed up the implementation. Their initiative needs to be supported by both Afghan and international authorities.\n\n(2) Reconciliation With Insurgency, Including the Taliban It is critical that all peacebuilders, including the Afghan government, UN organizations, ISAF, and American Forces engaging in 4\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan counterterrorism, share clear goals and strategies, form a new reconciliation committee composed of all the actors above, and implement robust programs for reconciliation. Concrete policies would be as follows:\n\n• Set clear goals and strategies by all peacebuilders, including US counterterrorism forces.\n\nCommittee) and establish a new committee composed of Afghan government, UNAMA, ISAF, and US Forces.\n\n• Start a massive program to create vocational centers all over the country for both Taliban soldiers who join in the reconciliation and other non-Taliban people.\n\n• Pass a UN resolution to remove the Taliban members from the UN Sanction list if they join in the new reconciliation program. It would shake the \"moderate Taliban leaders.\"\n\n• Negotiate with the \"national Taliban,\" who dislike the al-Qaida or Pakistandriven terrorist infusions; it may open the window to include the \"national Taliban\" in the government structure.\n\nThe important background for the reconciliation is that people in Afghanistan overwhelmingly support the idea of reconciliation. According to my opinion survey, 94% in Kandahar (Pashtun), 98% in Wardak (Pashtun), and 86% in Kapisa (Tajik) responded that reconciliation with insurgent groups, including Taliban, is the first priority to establish peace in Afghanistan. It is also important to recognize that 98% in Kandahar, 98% in Wardak, and 70% in Kapisa support the idea of a coalition between Karzai and the Taliban.\n\nBut actual reconciliation is very difficult in the current situation, especially because core members of the Taliban seem to have no incentive to make substantial concessions to the Afghan government, due to their ideological structure as well as their gaining territorial control. Thus, the main target for reconciliation in the current situation is low-and middle-level soldiers who fight for the Taliban because of their economic and social needs; actually, they are the majority of the insurgency. A provincial council member from Tagab district (insurgency-active district) said that if there are 420 Taliban soldiers in Tagab, 400 are working for the Taliban to obtain 100 USD per month; they are not ideologically driven. This view is supported by a majority of top government officials as well as international officials in Afghanistan.\n\nIn order to make substantial reconciliation with those people and low-and middle-level insurgent commanders, UNAMA, which was mandated for the reconciliation, should initiate a credible reconciliation mechanism and rearrange a new committee. The only mechanism for the reconciliation in Afghanistan now is the PTS (Strengthening Peace Program in Dari), led by the former president Mojadeddi and his son, who is acting director for PTS. In PTS, if individuals send an application with the promise to follow the Afghan constitution, the PTS committee will review it and, if appropriate, the Afghan government sends the letters to promise not to detain or kill those individuals. There are about 4600 individuals who had joined PTS by the end of 2007.\n\nUnfortunately, the PTS already lost credibility from both Afghan people and the international community. The main reasons are the following:\n\n(1) Taliban members who joined PTS have no guarantee of safety from the international forces, especially from American counterterrorism operations.\n\n(2) Taliban members who joined PTS CIR Working Paper No. 47 have no way to make a living after they cut links to and salaries from the Taliban.\n\n(3) Taliban members who joined PTS would be targeted by Taliban retaliation, and the government cannot protect them.\n\nIn terms of lack of safety from international forces, there are several prominent cases in which members who joined the PTS were attacked by American\n\nforces. For example, in Alasay District in Kapisa Province, one former Taliban commander, who controlled over 50 Taliban former soldiers, was invited by the Provincial Council members in Kapisa to join the PTS and work for the provincial government. The former commander joined PTS in the summer of 2007 and actively cooperated with the provincial government. Two month later (in the fall of 2007), he was invited by US forces to come to Graham Base for a meeting and was arrested by US forces. After this arrest, people from Alasay District stopped joining PTS. This story was spread all over the central regions. In terms of lack of employment, it is obvious that former Taliban soldiers who joined PTS tend to have extreme difficulty making a living, as the overall employment situation is so harsh. It is one of the main reasons why many people keep working for the Taliban. As for lack of safety from the Taliban, if the Taliban tries to retaliate against those who joined PTS, it is difficult for the Afghan government to protect them, as many areas in Pashtun do not have functioning police.\n\nThere is also concern about PTS credibility and accountability in the international community. For those reasons, it seems difficult for the international community to provide PTS with substantial funding for massive economic projects in coordination with the reconciliation program.\n\nThat is why I propose that it is vital for UNAMA to initiate rearranging a new reconciliation committee composed of every important actor, such as the Presidential Office, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, UNAMA, ISAF, and American Counterterrorism Forces. The PTS committee can be integrated into this new committee. When the new reconciliation committee issues a guarantee to former Taliban who join in the new reconciliation program, the guarantee should be shared by every actor. It can guarantee, at least, safety from international forces. It is not actually a huge step, at least in theory. The current PTS is supposed to give former Taliban the guarantee of no custody or attack from both the Afghan government and ISAF (international forces); only American forces will join the new committee. But it is vital to have every actor in the same boat for the reconciliation. It is also crucial for UNAMA to initiate talks between the Afghan government, International Forces, American Forces, and UNAMA to share clear goals and strategies. President Karzai's decision to deport two international staff who contacted heads of the Taliban organization stopped many UNAMA staff from attempting reconciliation efforts with insurgent commanders and groups. After clear goals and strategies are confirmed by the main actors above, the new reconciliation committee would start a massive program to create vocational centers all over the country. The significant way to encourage former Taliban soldiers to join the reconciliation would be to create sustainable job opportunities after the reconciliation, and many vocational centers in entire regions can encourage many Afghan Taliban soldiers to join the reconciliation program. 6 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan It is important for vocational centers to accept both former Taliban joining in reconciliation and other non-Taliban villagers, as (1) it can treat both former Taliban and non-Taliban equally, and (2) it might have a preventive effect on the attacks from Taliban retaliation because of the popularity of vocational centers in communities. The need to increase employment opportunities is very urgent; according to my opinion poll, 46% in Kandahar and Wardak and 36% in Kapisa answered that their employment is worse compared with three years ago. As I will write in the next section, projects by the Community Development Council (CDC) are extremely popular among Afghan people. When vocational centers decide the program of training, it would be beneficial to consult with CDC members and try to create the best training programs for different industries and agriculture in each region. Training programs can be linked with future CDC economic projects as well as small credit programs, to create small enterprises in local areas, such as the Afghan Rural Enterprise Development Program. (Many Pakistanis are coming to Kandahar for construction jobs, as many Afghans do not have skills for those jobs; vocational centers can create substantial job opportunities.)\n\nAdditionally, to enhance the reconciliation with core but flexible Taliban leaders, it is crucial for the UN Security Council to make a new resolution that if Taliban on the UN Sanction list decide to join the new reconciliation program, they will be removed from the list (Now there are about 20 Taliban former leaders on the list who have already joined the PTS). This discussion has continued for 4 years in the UN Security Council; it is time to make a critical decision to induce some Taliban leaders to the side of the government.\n\nAlthough it may be difficult to induce concessions from core members of the Taliban, especially Pakistan-or al-Qaidadriven Taliban who are \"international Taliban,\" it is still possible to negotiate with \"Afghan Taliban\" whose main objective is to control their country themselves and who need to have economic opportunities for survival. One of the critical policies could be to reconcile with these \"national insurgents\" and transform them into government officials, including local security forces or police who are paid an adequate salary. It is important for the government to obtain clear-cut control over these new government officials but give them incentive to support the government and to exclude the Pakistan-or al-Qaida-driven Taliban from their regions.\n\nThe International Forces are still important to increase the cost for the Taliban and to motivate \"national Taliban\" commanders and soldiers to consider reconciliation. But without reconciliation, military operations alone can push them into a corner and decisive fighting for a long time in the future. Afghanistan has only one year left before the next presidential election. It is time to make a decision on reconciliation.\n\nThe importance of improving the resource distribution (peace dividend) in increasing the legitimacy of Afghan government is without question; every top minister of the Afghan government and top leaders of UN organizations I interviewed share the view on how important it is to improve economic conditions for constructing legitimacy. A top official of UN agency told me, \"Legitimacy of the government comes from electricity, not from only elections in this fragile state!\" CIR Working Paper No. 47   At the same time, every Afghan leader I interviewed emphasized that it is critical to implement economic assistance with visible government involvement; otherwise, the assistance might enhance the legitimacy of \"donors,\" but not strengthen legitimacy of both the central and local governments.\n\nIn that sense, the National Solidarity Program (NSP), which is one of the biggest development projects that created over 20,000 Community Development Councils at the village level across Afghanistan, is very informative; according to my opinion survey, 92% in Kandahar, 84% in Wardak, and 95% in Kapisa answered that they are satisfied with the results of the CDC. The key reason is that people can make decisions about the projects they implement; local ownership does matter in increasing the support of people and then strengthening the legitimacy of the government. Many villagers I interviewed argue that \"The CDC project was the only hope that we could see since the peacebuilding started in 2001.\"\n\nThe critical challenge, though, is the sustainability of CDC projects. Once the Afghan National Trust Fund stops sending funds to CDCs (it may occur in 2009), the majority of CDCs seem to stop functioning, especially in implementing new projects. Thus, the recommendations for NSP are:\n\n• Create an international fund mechanism to sustain the NSP that keeps CDC projects in each village.\n\nEncourage CDC projects that have long-term employment opportunities, linked with possible vocational centers across the country.\n\nThe creation of international mechanisms to sustain community projects is urgent, as it would destroy the trust between people and governments if more than 20,000 CDCs were dissolved after only one or two projects were implemented. One of the key programs could be to sustain CDC projects but encourage communities to initiate projects that create long-term employment, such as irrigation or food processing. The possible vocational centers for reconciliation could be linked with long-term projects by CDCs.\n\nTo enhance the legitimacy of the government, the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) also need to have more substantial discussions with local governments at provincial and district levels. PRT projects need to be perceived as the result of collaboration between local governments and the PRT, so that the achievement of projects can increase the legitimacy of local governments. Many local government officials complained that the PRT did not contribute to the increase of trust in local government. The cooperation of the PRT and local government might delay the implementation, but it is crucial for the PRT, whose objective is defined as to increase the legitimacy of the Afghan government, to make substantial changes in operating its projects.\n\nIn return for providing local governments with visibility as local government projects, the international actors should be allowed to strengthen monitoring projects; erasing the perception of corruption is also crucial in restoring the trust in local governments.\n\nThere are several missed opportunities that were expressed by top government and UN officials.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan It is amazing that a majority of top leaders of the Afghan government and UN officials share the view that they could have made reconciliation even with core Taliban members in 2002 or 2003, when the Taliban was very weak and marginalized; substantial factions of the Taliban would have surrendered their weapons and participated in the 2005 congress elections. Brahimi, the former SRSG in Afghanistan, states officially that it was the biggest mistake for him not to start speaking with the Taliban in 2002. Reconciliation in the initial stage of peacebuilding, when former enemies are marginalized, would be a key lesson for future peacebuilding.\n\n(\n\nThere is a unified voice on how critical it is to improve living conditions in the first 6 months after peacebuilding starts. But the international community tends to focus on political dimensions and forget about the importance of economic and social improvements in the initial stage, which may be critical for constructing domestic legitimacy.\n\n(3) Creating a much simpler electoral system\n\nThe members of the Afghan constitutional committee did not seriously consider the complexity of Afghan elections (presidential elections, Lower House elections, Upper House elections that involve district and provincial council elections). The members thought that the more elections they had, the more legitimacy the Afghan government would have. One draft of the constitution had no Upper House election; that could have been much better in simplifying elections and legislative processes.\n\n(4) Role of the UN: UN Peacekeepers in Afghanistan?\n\nIt was not seriously discussed before, and is not realistic in this current operation. But theoretically, it was possible for UN peacekeepers to play a role in maintaining security in Afghanistan. The opposing argument is that NATO and Western countries never want the UN to play a commanding role in their forces in such combat zones because of UN mistakes in Somalia and Bosnia. The supporting argument is that the UN has more legitimacy in terms of acceptance from local populace. According to my opinion survey, 70% in Kandahar and more than 95% in Wardak and Kapisa think that the UN should play a central role in commanding international forces. It is also much easier for the UN to coordinate military operations and political programs, such as reconciliation and disarmament.\n\nThe role of the UN in commanding international forces should be an important discussion for future peacebuilding activities in the world, but may be not realistic for Afghanistan any time soon. However, at least UNAMA should be mandated to play a substantial role in coordinating military operations and political programs.\n\nTwo general conclusions can be drawn from the research with regard to enhancing the legitimacy of domestic government in the process of peacebuilding.\n\n(1) Political processes and programs need to be monitored, implemented, and even supervised by international organizations, especially by the UN; depending on local ownership without sufficient supervision is CIR Working Paper No. 47 often counter-effective with regard to political programs. It is not because of the lack of capabilities of local people, but because of the nature of post-conflict nation building: A credible third party needs to play a role in ensuring an impartial peace process and guaranteeing that the political rights of various factions are protected when they comply with elections or disarmament.\n\nIt is notable that the UN has very high trust and credibility in Afghanistan. According to my own opinion poll, 80% of People surveyed in Kandahar, 95 % in Wardak, and 99% in Kapisa perceive that the UN is more credible than individual states in creating good government in Afghanistan. This credibility of the UN might enable the UN to play a crucial role in political programs, such as disarmament and reconciliation.\n\n(2) Economic projects must be seen as government programs as much as possible. In other words, economic and social improvements should be seen as results of government efforts so that the improvements increase the legitimacy of the domestic government. In initial stage of peacebuilding, though, it may be recommended for international actors to have more direct investments to make quick impacts on improving the living conditions of people, but it is important to make a smooth transit to the assistance projects that respect more local ownership. In return, the international actors should be allowed to monitor government projects and address the concern of corruption.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan\n\nWhat is Legitimacy? Its Application to Peacebuilding\n\nThe question for my research is \"in the process of peacebuilding, how peacebuilders-both domestic and international peacebuilders-can construct 'legitimate governments' in which people comply with rules of newly created governments in a voluntary mode.\" To clarify the definition of \"legitimate government,\" though, it is indispensable to identify what legitimacy is.\n\n\"Legitimacy\" seems to have a shared definition by a majority of International Relations theorists. Hurd states that \"legitimacy refers to the normative belief by an actor that a rule or institution ought to be obeyed.\" 3 Frank argues that \"legitimacy exerts a pull to compliance which is powered by the quality of the rule or of the rule-making institution and not by coercive authority. It exerts a claim to compliance in the voluntarist mode.\" 4 The common feature of these definitions suggests that legitimacy essentially contains psychological elements, in which different actors judge whether or not rules and the rule-making institutions are fundamentally \"right\" so that they want to comply with them even in a voluntary mode.\n\nThe definition of legitimacy, in turn, indicates key features of the \"legitimate government.\" Reus-Smit presents the definition of \"being legitimate\": \"when legitimacy is ascribed to an actor or institutions, we describe it as legitimate.\"foot_4 Thus, \"legitimate government\" can be defined as a government under which people tend to comply with the rules of government, not because of the coercive powers of the government, nor because of personal calculation of short-term interests, but because of their conviction that the compliance is right.\n\nI agree with Hurd that legitimacy is not necessarily indispensable for governments to create social control; it may be possible for some governments to establish social control by only coercion or sanction to coerce people to follow their rules. But without legitimacy, \"coercion and sanction are costly mechanisms of control\" because the controllers would need to deploy police and forces on every street corner.foot_5 Thus, legitimacy is critical to pull compliance and achieve social control with substantially lower costs for controllers. 7 Those definitions and understanding of legitimacy clarify the question of my research: it is about the mechanisms of creating legitimate governments in the process of peacebuilding, especially when the international community-the UN, regional organizations, NGOs, and foreign states-is deeply involved in creating new governments in these war-torn states. The creation of \"legitimate government\" by the involvement-or intervention-of international actors in war-torn states faces enormous challenges. On the one hand, domestic peacebuilders suffer from widely prevailing hatred and hostility from different domestic groups and actors who fought war.\n\nOn the other hand, international peacebuilders face the risk that their intervention can be perceived as quasicolonial actions. Thus, both newly created governments and international actors face severe challenges and difficulties to obtain domestic legitimacy in the eyes of local people; this research is an attempt to address this critical question.\n\nIn order to create a hypothesis about how the domestic legitimacy can be constructed in the peacebuilding process, I have conducted numerous interviews with practitioners, such as UN officials and government officials who are deeply involved in peacebuilding around the world, as well as domestic peacebuilders (mainly government officials) working in wartorn states since 2006. 8 As a consequence, I hypothesize that there are five key factors that might have a substantial impact on determining compliance or noncompliance with critical political developments in peacebuilding, such as results of elections, creation of 8 Those officials include the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacebuilding Support, the former Under Secretary-General for political affairs in the Department of Political Affairs (DPA), directors of the policy planning unit in DPA, acting director of the best practice unit at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), and numerous officials in charge of each peacebuilding operation at both DPA and DPKO, as well as officials in the Peacebuilding Support Office. Ogata Sadako, the president of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and JICA officials in charge of peacebuilding activities in the world also continue to give me opportunities to interview those officials. I also had many meetings with Canadian government officials and scholars who are deeply involved in peacebuilding activities.\n\nnew constitutions, and disarmament of local military factions. And repeated compliance with these key political programs can create legitimate governments in the long run. On the other hand, if people continue to decide on noncompliance with those political developments, the legitimacy of the government will be eroded.\n\nGraph in Appendix 2 shows these five hypothetical factors and how they could be linked with compliance and noncompliance and then the creation or erosion of domestic legitimacy.\n\nThe policies regarding these five factors can be influenced, although not perfectly controlled, by international actors (international peacebuilders) who engage in peacebuilding: In this sense, the policies regarding these factors can be considered \"policy inputs\" that can largely be influenced by international actors.\n\n(1) Role of the UN There are clear-cut differences in the roles of the UN in the current peacebuilding efforts. For example, the UN has had only a \"marginal role\" in Iraq, especially in the first year after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. 9 In Afghanistan, the role of the UN mission since the U.S. attack against the Taliban government has been only to assist the political aspects of Afghan peacebuilding; the UN basically has not played any role in commanding international military operations-both the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) led by NATO as well\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan as the military operations called \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" are commanded by the United States. 10\n\nIn contrast, the UN mission had full authority in East Timor during the first three years' transitional period since 1999, and in numerous UN peacebuilding missions in Africa, such as Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Sierra Leone. In these peacebuilding operations, the UN missions commanded both international military and civilian operations under the authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG). The UN international civilian police have virtually assumed \"full responsibility for law enforcement.\" 11\n\nThe question is whether these differences in the roles of the UN would make a substantial difference in pulling compliance from local populace and leaders and then creating legitimate governments, and how.\n\n(\n\nIn every peacebuilding operation, the degree to which the different local groups should be included in the political process-in other words, how broadly the different factions should participate in creating new governments-is one of the most difficult decisions for peacebuilders; many international officials who experienced peacebuilding share the view that this inclusiveness is critical for establishing new legitimate governments.\n\nWhile the UN officials tend to assume that broader inclusiveness is better, there are notable arguments that assert some types of 10 Paris 2004, 226. & UN Security Council Resolution 1386, 1413, 1444, 1510, 1563, 1623, 1707, 1776, regarding the authorization of ISAF by the UN Security Council. 11 Caplan 2005, 46.\n\nspoilers should be excluded and militarily defeated. For example, Stedman argues that \"total spoilers\" never change their goals, so they should be defeated, while the \"limited spoilers\" or \"greedy spoilers\" should be included in the peace process as those spoilers can change their interests and goals by having their demands met-mainly economic need. 12 In sum, whether, how, and under what conditions different political factionsincluding possible insurgent groups-should be included to create legitimate governments in the process of peacebuilding are the key questions for this research.\n\n(3) Local ownership This is the factor that many international officials who engage in peacebuilding use to answer the question of creating legitimacy in the eyes of local people: making local people feel that they are the main actors. As we will see in Afghan cases, those claims are also largely shared by domestic peacebuilders.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a shared perception by international donors that giving full local ownership has potential risk to create corrupt governments, especially in war-torn states. 13 In many cases, new governments in war-torn states also do not have capacity to implement projects due to lack of resource and political wills.\n\nWhether or not local ownership really matters in creating compliance with both economic and political programs, and in what timing, are important questions for this research. CIR Working Paper No. 47 (4) Resource distribution (the government's\n\nThere seems to be a shared understanding by many practitioners as well as scholars that it is critical for peacebuilders to achieve efficient resource distribution or the provision of government services with regard to improving people's daily living conditions (such as water, electricity, and medical service) in creating legitimacy. Salvatore Lombardo, the representative of UNHCR in Afghanistan, explicitly asserts, \"Legitimacy comes from electricity, not from only elections in this fragile state.\" 14 This view is also shared by many top government officials in charge of peacebuilding. 15 One important examination for this \"resource distribution\" is there might be a \"trade-off\" between international peacebuilders and domestic peacebuilders in terms of the impact of resource distribution on the local people's perception of the peacebuilders; for example, if local people perceive that all economic projects are conducted by international actors, it might harm their support for new domestic governments.\n\nThus, it may require the international peacebuilders to exercise careful management to increase the legitimacy of domestic government while simultaneously improving socioeconomic conditions for local people. That would raise substantial challenges for peacebuilders as these fragile states sometimes might not have a\n\n14 Author's interview with Salvatore Lombardo, Representative of UNHCR in Afghanistan on 20 February 2008. 15 For example, both Zia, the Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, and Popal, the director of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance in Afghanistan, unanimously emphasize the criticality of improving living conditions of people to increase the legitimacy of the Afghan government (Author's interview with Minister Zia on 31 May 2008 and with Director Popal on 4 June 2008).\n\nfunctioning state bureaucracy to implement economic projects. 16\n\n(5) Ways (or procedures) of using force\n\nThe question about when the use of force by both domestic and international peacebuilders is seen as acceptable or legitimate in the eyes of local people has been a significant puzzle.\n\nDemocracy theorists argue that what is crucial for democratic states in the use of force is that \"they are constitutional and operate under the rule of law.\" 17 The emphasis on the rule of law that is knowable and fair to all people-thus, not arbitrary-is very insightful in examining the use of force by international actors in peacebuilding.\n\nOf course, the challenge is that in war-torn states, the rule of law in the use of force might not be established yet; thus, it is not an easy task for international actors to make legal rules for the use of force and make them knowable to everybody. What kinds of legal rules and procedures should be established in terms of the use of force in enhancing domestic legitimacy is one of the important questions. 18 16 These concepts of \"resource distribution\" as well as \"local ownership\" and \"inclusiveness\" are perfectly matched with theoretical arguments about the source of legitimacy. Keohane (2006, 3) argues that there are two sources of legitimacy: one is output legitimacy that refers to the \"achievement of the substantive purposes of the organization, such as security and welfare\"; the second is \"input legitimacy\" that \"refers to the processes by which decisions are reached.\" And \"resource distribution\" here can be categorized as \"output legitimacy,\" while \"inclusiveness\" and \"local ownership\" can be categorized as \"input legitimacy.\" 17 Warren 2007, 387. Emphasis in original. 18 Morphet (2002), for example, argues that transitional civil administrations are more likely to achieve political legitimacy, nationally and internationally, if the states involved base their peacebuilding work on international legal standards and norms, as seen in East Timor.\n\n14 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan What Are Processes to Establish Legitimate Governments or Erode Them? My field research aims to examine what kind of policies in these five hypothetical factors are effective in creating compliance with key political developments and establishing legitimate domestic governments in the specific context of each peacebuilding. In other words, the research will try to find the possible linkages between these five factors and compliance/noncompliance with key political developments, such as conducting elections, creating new constitutions, and disarming armed groups (warlords).\n\nIn order to elucidate these linkages, the research will investigate not only whether policies regarding these factors affect compliance/noncompliance, but also why and how these policies induce the compliance/noncompliance behaviors.\n\nAs I explained, Hurd argues that there are three mechanisms for compliance: (1) coercion, (2) self-interest calculation, and (3) legitimacy. However, I assert that Hurd's explanation about compliance based on \"selfinterest calculation\" is missing one important component in the mechanism of compliance, especially when we focus on the building of democratic states. 19 It is the factor provided 19 An important caveat for this research is that I assume that international peacebuilders assist the creation of \"democratic governments\" in the process of peacebuilding. While there might be an argument that the democratic system is not a good system to establish order in war-torn states, it is difficult to imagine, at least any time soon, that international actors such as foreign states or international organizations will substantially assist the creation of new totalitarian or authoritarian regimes as an ultimate goal of peacebuilding efforts. Those efforts by Przeworski, a prominent democracy scholar, who suggests that \"democratic institutions must be fair and impartial\" when people accept the results of elections repeatedly. 20 It is plausible that if political factions who lost elections fear that their political rights might be destroyed or their members put in jail by the new government, it will be difficult for them to accept the results of lost elections. It must be the same for compliance with disarmament by local factions. Thus, the sense of \"impartiality\" may be critical in assuring both their chance of winning elections in the next elections, as well as protecting their political rights even if they lose elections. This credibility of a third party might be also critical in conducting disarmament against military factions because they cannot disarm themselves until they can perceive that their political rights will be protected after the disarmament. 21 I hypothesize that this sense of \"impartiality\" would be something that \"international\" peacebuilders can bring to the process of peacebuilding. In war-torn states, it is extremely difficult for domestic institutions to give a sense of \"impartiality\" because they also fought with other factions. Thus, the international actors may bring credibility as impartial peacebuilders in the eyes of local parties and people, and this credibility seem to be difficult to obtain \"international legitimacy\" in the eyes of the international community. If peacebuilding with the ultimate goal of creating authoritarian or totalitarian regimes become prominent, we need to make different analysis on how those efforts can be possible. 20 Przeworski 1991, 33. 21 Carolyn McAskie, the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacebuilding Support, emphasized the importance of this credibility, which can be injected by the UN presence as a credible third party (Author's interview with Carolyn McAskie on 4 June 2007).\n\nCIR Working Paper No. 47 would be the key basis for even interestdriven compliance.\n\nIn short, there would be two routes from the five factors to compliance/noncompliance behaviors: one is the \"direct effect\" of the policies regarding these key five factors on the compliance/noncompliance behaviors; the second is the \"indirect effect\" of the factors on \"the creation of a sense of credibility as impartial,\" and this credibility/incredibility would influence compliance/noncompliance behaviors with key political developments. (Of course, it needs to be examined by field research whether that is the case.)\n\nIt is important to recognize that it would be almost impossible to create legitimate domestic governments in a very short time frame; only repeated compliance with key political developments, such as accepting the results of elections, the contents of constitutions, and disarming military factions, can establish legitimate domestic government.\n\nThe reason is that the more compliance actors comply with key political procedures, the more their governments become legitimate in the eyes of local people in the long run, as governments' rules are internalized in their social or even psychological conditions, and \"democracy becomes the only game in town.\" 22 Different theoretical findings also indicate that domestic legitimate government can be established only by the repeated compliance with key political procedures.foot_11 On the other hand, repeated noncompliance with key political events by using violent methods would erode domestic legitimacy, collapse new governments, and cause relapse into conflict.\n\nIn this process of \"repeated compliance/noncompliance,\" I hypothesize that the change of interests or identities of local factions (socialization) are important in enhancing the repeated compliance. For example, some military factions might change their interests (e.g., from the expansion of territorial occupation to the improvement of their popularity for election) or their identities (e.g., from military factions to political parties), and these changes of interests and identities can drastically enhance the chance of repeated compliance.foot_12\n\nWhat Should Be Investigated?\n\nThe linkages explained above are hypotheses; thus, without investigation with detailed field research, we are not sure about whether these linkages occur or not, and how. In order to examine these linkages and try to find effective policies on these five factors, this research takes three main steps.\n\nI will research what kinds of policies have been implemented, mainly regarding the five key factors, such as the role of the UN, inclusiveness, local ownership, resource distribution, and use of force in each peacebuilding. I will also investigate the aims of peacebuilders on these policies, as well as the outcomes of these policies.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan\n\n(\n\nAfter identifying the key policies, I will gather data on behaviors of local factions in compliance and noncompliance with key political developments, such as \"compliance rate by commanders\" on disarmament or \"military attack against governments.\" The compliance with the constitution may be measured by the number of insurgency attacks because no constitution allows military factions to conduct military attacks on the government or international peacebuilders.\n\nAfter I obtain data for compliance or noncompliance, I will investigate the \"motives\" of actors in determining compliance or noncompliance. In this context, understanding the perception of ordinary people is critical as the people's perception toward peacebuilders (including domestic governments) must have crucial impact on the behaviors of political and military actors.\n\n(3) Recommendations From these analyses, I make recommendations in each case about effective policies that would enhance the establishment of \"domestic legitimacy\" in the peacebuilding process. The recommendations deal with both ongoing situations and past activities; lessons from the past should be also important for future peacebuilding activities in the world.\n\nWith regard to investigating the challenges of Afghan legitimacy construction, I conducted field research in February 2008 (2 weeks) and May & June (6 weeks) in Afghanistan based on my hypothesis. In order to understand the policies in five key factors and key political developments, I accessed both domestic and international policy makers and leaders.\n\nIt may be a philosophical question whether there is a unified answer about effective policies in these hypothetical factions for creating legitimate governments in war-torn states across cases. But I do believe that accumulated understanding of possible effective policies in different peacebuilding cases can give us important lessons and implications on how peacebuilders should deal with both ongoing and future peacebuilding efforts.\n\nIt may be the same for research about airplane accidents. You might not be able to find a law-like general theory to account for all airplane accidents across regions and times, but we still need to make precise investigations about the causality of each accident and recommendations on how to reduce airplane accidents in the future.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan\n\nChapter 2: Why Comply or Not Comply? Analysis of Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups Background: DDR and DIAG in Afghanistan The disarmament program in Afghanistan started at a relatively early stage of Afghan peacebuilding. In February 2003, one year and two months after the Bohn Conference (which decided a major course of peacebuilding in Afghanistan), the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) process was initiated. The DDR in Afghanistan mainly targeted former soldiers of the Afghan Military Forces (that were state military forces before the Taliban regime). DDR supported the disarmament and integration of 63,380 former soldiers; and 55,804 soldiers chose one of the reintegration options: obtaining vocational training, small business opportunities, government jobs, etc.foot_13\n\nAs the DDR in Afghanistan targeted the former soldiers of the Afghan national army, there was shared recognition that the next disarmament program should be initiated to disarm numerous illegal armed groups (warlords who possess military powers in local areas) to establish security orders governed by the central government. Thus, in 2005, the program called DIAG (the Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups) was launched, aiming for \"improving human security through disbandment of illegal armed groups and reducing the level of violence in the community.\"foot_14 DIAG first identified about 1700 illegal armed groups (IAG) in the entire country and started disbanding those groups by collecting weapons from them. Due to security reasons, DIAG was mainly launched in the Eastern, Central, and Northern regions in Afghanistan. DIAG is monitored and supervised by the Joint Secretariat composed of major domestic institutions, such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, Disarmament and Reintegration Commission (D &R Commission), as well as international actors, such as the International Security Forces (ISAF), UNAMA, and Afghan New Beginning Program (ANBP). The Joint Secretariat identified targeted districts from each province, and the DIAG committee in each province started persuading commanders identified as leaders of illegal armed groups to surrender weapons.\n\nAs Aziz Ahmadzai, the acting director of DIAG (No. 2 Afghan official in charge of DIAG), asserts, the DIAG is \"a central pillar of entire security reform in Afghanistan.\" 27 Without DIAG, it is difficult for the central government to establish functioning police and armies that can effectively provide people with security because \"without disbanding illegal armed groups, these groups can switch their sides and become insurgents at any moment.\" 28 At the same time, DIAG also aims to create trust between people and the government. Masoom Stanekzai, the Vice Chairman of D & R Commission (the Chairman of the D & R Commission is the vice president; thus, Stanekzai is virtually the No. 1 Afghan official who is specifically responsible for DIAG), asserts that \"because there is substantial suspicion among people and tribes toward the government with regard to security, it is critical to create trust through implementing DIAG.\" 29 A major component of DIAG in creating trust between people and the government is the promise of DIAG to provide development projects to the districts where more than 75% of targeted weapons are collected. In other words, if more than 75% of weapons that are identified as possessed by illegal armed groups in a district are surrendered to the government by commanders, DIAG will implement development projects in those districts.\n\nThis mechanism has two major objectives: one is to give commanders an incentive to surrender their weapons to the government; the second is to create trust between people and the government by \"improving both socio-economic and security conditions.\" 30 The achievement of DIAG is not small. As of 31 August 2008, DIAG has succeeded in collecting 41,183 weapons and 30,466 ammunitions. Among 1700 identified illegal armed groups, 363 illegal armed groups have already disbanded. Considering the current security situation in Afghanistan, David Wilson, the head of the Afghan New Beginning Program (ANBP), which is an international counterpart to the D & R Commission in implementing DIAG, claimed that \"disbanding more than 300 illegal armed groups is not a bad result at all.\"foot_19 At the same time, DIAG faces enormous challenges. The deteriorating security and the Taliban's regaining powers in Afghanistan make DIAG implementation more difficult. The number of weapons possessed by Afghan people seems also huge: It is estimated that there are from 1 million to 20 million weapons in Afghanistan, and if it is 5 million, \"it would take 100 years to collect all weapons in Afghanistan.\" 32 But I argue that it is important to keep DIAG operational so that DIAG can give people perspectives that even commanders are cooperating with the government so that they would gain more security provided by the government in the future; people can also experience development projects as a result of the compliance of commanders with DIAG. In other words, DIAG is critical in giving people \"the confidence in government's ability to provide security and development.\" 33 And it is noteworthy that an overwhelming majority of Afghan people support DIAG. According to my own opinion survey, 97% of people surveyed in Kapisa Province, 100% of Wardak Province, and 78% of Kandahar Province answered that commanders should surrender their weapons (Appendix 1, Q. 23). The major reason is that people want to have development projects as a result of surrendering weapons; at the same time, many people also believe that if commanders surrender weapons, the government police will start functioning and providing them with more security. One villager living in Wardak Province responded to me that \"if commanders surrender weapons, the government police will function and start giving us the security in our community, even 20 20\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan though there is no functioning police now.\" 34 There were many voices who expected the future improvement of security if DIAG is completed in their regions.\n\nDue to all the reasons above, there is significant importance to implementing DIAG.\n\nIn the following sections, I will analyze \"reasons for compliance\" by examining the case of Kapisa Province, \"reasons for noncompliance\" by examining the case of Jalrez District in Wardak Province, \"the problem of DIAG development projects,\" and \"recommendations\" for future DIAG.\n\nIn order to examine motives for compliance and noncompliance behaviors with DIAG, I interviewed 10 commanders who faced the request by DIAG to surrender weapons and complied or did not comply with the DIAG program. As for a case where commanders complied with DIAG, I focused on two districts in Kapisa Province: Kohistan 1 District and Koh Band District. Both districts have already reached the DIAG compliance rate, which means that more than 75% of targeted weapons have already been surrendered to the government. (1) Economic Incentive for Their Communities There is no doubt that one of the most important reasons for complying with DIAG is the economic incentive that DIAG provides. According to the DIAG program, 34 Author's interview with a villager in Wardak during the opinion survey in Wardak on 16 June 2008. Every interview with villagers during the opinion survey was conducted with a condition of anonymity due to security reasons. commanders who surrender weapons are not going to obtain any money or projects in return for their weapons, but the districts they live in will gain economic development projects (DIAG development projects). This mechanism becomes a big incentive for commanders to surrender weapons. For example, Hassam-u-din, a commander in Koh Band District who commanded more than 300 people during the war against the Taliban, surrendered about 600 weapons to the DIAG program. He explained the reasons: \"First of all, we are already tired of wars. Second, I realized that if we surrendered weapons, our people in our district would obtain important development projects. As my main concern is always my people, I judged that it was better to comply with DIAG.\" 35 The other four commanders who complied with DIAG in Kapisa unanimously responded to me that their first reason for the compliance was that they thought it was good to obtain development projects in their districts, even if they would not directly obtain benefits or money. In this sense, the strategy by top officials in charge of DIAG was successful. Stanekzai argues that because the collection of weapons by DIAG was not so encouraging in 2006, DIAG changed its implementation strategy: When the DIAG Joint Secretariat identify districts for DIAG implementation, the DIAG officials start discussion with local people to identify possible development projects by DIAG even before 75% of targeted weapons are surrendered. Stanekzai asserts, \"By starting the discussion with local people about the potential development projects even before CIR Working Paper No. 47 commanders surrender weapons, those discussions themselves become big pressure for commanders to surrender weapons.\"foot_23 After starting this practice, DIAG gained momentum and compliance with DIAG drastically speeded up.foot_24 The interviews with many commanders seem to prove the effectiveness of this strategy. (2) Initiation of \"Socialization\" (Change of Interest and Identities) When commanders surrender weapons, they are doing so for not only altruistic reasons; commanders believe that compliance with DIAG is one of the important steps to change their identities from military commanders to political leaders. All five commanders who complied with DIAG and responded to my interviews in Kapisa expressed their ambitions to become candidates for the Provincial Councils or even Parliament in the next election. Raees Arab Shah, who commanded 600 soldiers during the war against the Taliban, explained, \"I heard numerous expectations from many people in my regions that they want me to become a candidate for next provincial council or parliament election…And my cooperation with DIAG is one of the important reasons why people supported me and appreciated me.\"foot_25 Hassam-u-din also was frank about this point: \"My people want to be a candidate for provincial council member in the next election, thus I will run for it….And my people are very happy about my cooperation with DIAG.\"foot_26\n\nThus, as my hypothesis predicted, socialization, that is, the change of interests and identities of political actors, seems to play important roles in this compliance mechanism. And if these commanders succeed in changing their identities, it would enhance the future compliance with different political events, such as elections, then strengthen the legitimacy of the government. Unfortunately, however, the slow implementation of DIAG development projects has become a big impediment to this socialization, as will be explained in following sections (In Koh Band District, for example, the development projects have not been implemented for more than one year after the compliance rate reached 75%, and those commanders who cooperated with DIAG lost confidence and trust in DIAG.).\n\n(\n\nThe commanders who complied with DIAG also unanimously expressed that one of the main reasons why they trusted the promise of the government is the involvement of the United Nations. In the DIAG implementation process, the Afghan New Beginning Program (ANBP), which is supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is collaborating with the DIAG committee in each province, led by the provincial governors, and persuading commanders to surrender weapons. The UNAMA staff also committed to monitor the DIAG process in many parts of Afghanistan. And the involvement of the UN agencies appears to play a critical role in giving commanders trust in the promise of the government.\n\nThe commander Hassam-u-din was explicit on this point: \"If only government officials had come to me and persuaded me to surrender weapons, I would never have complied with those requests, because I cannot trust the current government. Because the UN staff came to us and promised that we would obtain development projects for our district if we surrendered weapons, we decided to Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan surrender weapons to DIAG.\" 40 Another commander in Kohistan 1 District, Meraj-udin, also asserted that \"I decided to surrender weapons because I thought our district could gain economic projects in the future; and because it was the UN staff who came to me, I trusted their words.\" 41 Five commanders who responded to my interviews in Kapisa unanimously argued that part of the reasons why they trusted the government promise on development projects was they were persuaded by the UN staff, who they thought would be more credible than the government officials.\n\nWhy did they think the UN staff (including Afghan staff) is more credible? Hassam-u-din argues that he and other commanders watched the work of several UN agenciesmainly work by Afghan UN staff-and they thought the UN is making serious efforts to solve their regional problems. 42 This perspective was shared by other commanders, such as Raees Arab Shah and Abdul Fath Shafiq, the commanders in Kapisa Province. . Those views about the credibility of the UN are shared by local ordinary people: In Kapisa Province, 99% of people responded that the UN is more credible than other foreign states (Appendix 1, Q. 14). With regard to the reasons for this credibility, 74% of people answered \"because the UN personnel are from many different regions in the world,\" 63% of people answered \"because the UN is established by the resolution of the UN Security Council,\" and 63% of people answered \"because the UN is neutral to every faction.\" (It is important to recognize that 70% of all Afghans are said 40 Author's interview with Hassm-u-din on 22 June 2008. 41 Author's interview with Meraj-u-din, the commander in Kohistan 1 District in Kapisa Province, on 22 June 2008. 42 Author's interview with Hassam-u-din on 22 June 2008.\n\nto be listening to BBC radio (or TV) every day for their information; their political awareness is very high, even if about 60% of Afghans are illiterate, according to the Ministry of Education.)\n\nIt seems certain that this role of the UN, as a credible peacebuilders or a third party, plays a key role in giving military and political leaders the motivation to comply with crucial political programs such as DIAG. This credibility is precious and needs to be maintained.\n\nIf the economic incentive (resource distribution), the role of the UN, and socialization (change of identities and interests) are major factors contributing to compliance, how do other factors such as inclusiveness, local ownership, and the use of force function in this mechanism? With regard to inclusiveness, it is true that Kohistan 1 and Koh Band Districts are Tajikdominated areas and commanders tend to be sympathetic to the current government, as these commanders fought against the Taliban as part of the Northern Alliance in the 1990s. Abdul Fatah Shafiq, the district governor in Kohistan 1, said that \"Kohistan 1 and Koh Band were a focal point for Tajik people to fight against the Taliban.\" 43 However, this ethnic sympathy seem less related to the compliance with DIAG, as many other districts where Pashtun people dominate also reached 75% compliance; for example, Maydan Shahr District in Wardak Province is a highly Pashtun-dominated district and was controlled by the Taliban during the Taliban regime, but it reached 75% compliance in early 2008. Three CIR Working Paper No. 47 commanders who live in Maydan Shahr District and complied with DIAG by surrendering weapons-Haji Abdul Qadim, Gul Rahman, and Aziz Ullah-asserted that they decided to surrender weapons because DIAG potential development projects must be beneficial for their districts and themselves as well. 44 In that sense, inclusiveness, or reconciliation, seems more directly linked with security situations, and security situations have a critical impact on the compliance with DIAG. If commanders feel physical threats from other insurgency or other military groups-including the Taliban-it is difficult for commanders to surrender weapons. And Kohistan 1 and Koh Band are one of the safest and secured districts in the central region of Afghanistan. In 2006, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, collaborating with UNHCR, conducted more than 8000 interviews with local people and issued a comprehensive report on \"Economic and Social Rights in Afghanistan.\" 45 Because of special cooperation by the Commission for this research project, I obtained the data in key districts for my analysis, such as Kandahar City, Kohistan 1, Koh Band, and Jalrez in Wardak Province (which I will examine in the section on \"reasons for noncompliance\"). According to this data, 62 persons responded to the survey in Kohistan 1 and 32 persons responded in Koh Band, and there were only 2 killings that occurred to interviewees or their families during the past 12 months in 2006. (This has a sharp contrast with Jalrez District, which had 10 interviewees whose families were killed 44 Author's interview with Haji Abdul Qadim, Gul Rahman, and Aziz Ullah on 15 June 2008. 45 Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, \"Economic and Social Rights in Afghanistan May 2006.\" during the last 12 months among 58 interviewees.)\n\nIn my opinion survey, 86% of people in Kohistan 1 and Koh Band think that their daily life has become safer than their life under the Taliban government, which has again a sharp contrast with Wardak Province, where 64% of people think that their daily life has become more dangerous than their life under the Taliban government (Appendix 1, Q. 22). In these dangerous regions, the insecurity prevents commanders from surrendering weapons because they feel physical threats.\n\nIn short, inclusiveness, or reconciliation, have critical impact on security situation (as we will examine in the next chapter), then security conditions greatly influence the compliance with the disarmament program.\n\nIn terms of local ownership, as Stanekzai insisted, it seems necessary for local authorities to lead the process \"to avoid the suspicion that DIAG is imposed by outsiders.\" 46 But as many commanders claim, they decided to comply with DIAG substantially because the UN is involved and they trusted the UN. In this sense, the UN needs to be responsible for not only monitoring but also supervising the whole process of implementing DIAG-if necessary-to keep the trust of local commanders. As I will examine in more detail in the section on the problem of DIAG development projects, it is sometimes dangerous for the UN and other international actors to use \"local ownership\" and avoid responsibility, when their involvement is indispensable to induce compliance.\n\nAs for the use of force, commanders in Kohistan 1 and Koh Band assert that \"they never comply with surrendering weapons by\n\n46 Author's interview with Masoom Stanekzai on 18 February 2008. 24 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan coercion of the government because the government is relatively weak.\" 47 Their claims seem plausible because even though the police in Kohistan 1 and Koh Band have relatively high standards, the number of police and military soldiers deployed in Kohistan 1 is 78 and in Koh Band is 93, while big commanders such as Raees Arab Shah or Hassam-u-din still obtain powers to influence (or command) 300 to 600 former subordinates. In that sense, the coercion by the government seems to play a relatively marginal role in the compliance with DIAG. In short, research in Kohistan 1 and Koh Band Districts suggests that the key mechanisms for complying with DIAG are (1) economic incentives, (2) socialization (identity shift from military leaders to political leaders), and (3) the credibility of the UN. Inclusiveness and reconciliation seem to play key roles in determining security situations that also have big impacts on the compliance with DIAG. Reasons for Noncompliance: Examining Jalrez District in Wardak Province Jalrez District is located in the valley in Wardak Province, which is next to Kabul Province. Now the UN officials have no access to Jalrez due to insecurity. In order to interview commanders and people from Jalrez District, I needed to ask people and commanders to come to the provincial center of Wardak Province, which the UN still had access to in June, 2008. As of 31 August 2008, the DIAG Joint Secretariat identifies that no weapons from Jalrez have been handed over to the DIAG 47 Author's interview with Hassam-u-din on 22 June 2008.\n\nprogram; there is no compliance with DIAG. Jalrez is one of the few districts that the DIAG Joint Secretariat has targeted for DIAG, but no weapons have been counted.\n\n(\n\n) Losing Credibility of the DIAG It is ironic that commanders in Jalrez made substantial cooperation with DDR by handing over hundreds of weapons in 2004 and 2005, but when commanders in Jalrez surrendered weapons in 2005 to the government authority, those weapons were not counted as DIAG hand-overs, though these commanders believed that their weapons would be counted for DIAG. The reason is that those weapons in Jalrez were handed over to the government just one month before DIAG was formally launched in 2005. And this missed calculation or missed coordination created a huge mistrust in the government and deprived the commanders of the motives to cooperate with DIAG. Haji Mohammad Hazrat Janan, the Chief of Provincial Council in Wardak Province, lives in Jalrez and committed himself to persuade commanders to surrender weapons in the whole DIAG process in Jalrez. Janan asserted that he and many commanders in Jalrez at first were very optimistic about weapons collections because \"We were very tired of wars; we thought that weapons collection is a good step for reconstruction and rehabilitation.\" 48 After Janan talked with DIAG officials and confirmed that Jalrez District could obtain development projects if commanders surrendered more than 75% of targeted weapons, Janan visited every village to persuade commanders to surrender weapons in 2005. As a result, according to Janan, about 600 weapons and 1000 ammunitions CIR Working Paper No. 47\n\nwere surrendered to the government. But unfortunately, these weapons were not counted by the DIAG program (or not registered as DIAG collection of weapons) because the weapons were released one month before DIAG officially started.\n\nIt seems certain that the weapons were surrendered to the government from Jalrez in 2005; one commander, who used to live in Jalrez and now is working in a high-ranked position (director level) in the Afghan government, told me that he surrendered about 50 weapons for DIAG, and he even presented the certificate by the government, which proved that he surrendered weapons. He asserts, \"Many commanders in Jalrez did cooperate with DIAG, but nothing happened after that. It created huge mistrust in the DIAG program.\" 49 There are several UN officials who were in charge of the DIAG in the region and remember that many Jalrez commanders surrendered weapons to the government. 50 Some of the UN staff were not certain about why those weapons were not counted as compliance by the DIAG Joint Secretariat. Because of this missed coordination and lack of explanation about why these weapons were not counted, the commanders mistrust the DIAG program and stopped cooperating with DIAG.\n\n(\n\nWith regard to the possibility to persuade commanders to cooperate with DIAG in the future-in addition to addressing the issue of recounting weapons that were already surrendered to the government-there seems to be two fundamental problems in persuading commanders in Jalrez: poverty, 49 Author's interview with a commander who used to live in Jalrez, with condition of anonymity, in June 2008. 50 Author confirmed several UN staff that commanders in Jalrez did surrender some of their weapons in 2005.\n\nor lack of jobs for commanders, and worsening security.\n\nPoverty and lack of job opportunities in Jalrez give commanders a big incentive to sell their weapons in markets. It is said that commanders in Jalrez can obtain 600 to 700 USD by selling one AK-47 (Kalashnikov); thus, due to their own economic problems, commanders just sell their weapons to the market. 51 According to my own survey, 43% of people surveyed in Jalrez (and 46% in Wardak in total) answered that their employment conditions have become worse compared with three years ago (Appendix 1, Q. 2-F). That is 10% higher than those in Kohistan 1 or Koh Band, which have a higher compliance rate.\n\n(\n\nThe other critical reason seems to be \"worsening security.\" One UN official lamented to me that \"Jalrez has become their kingdom. We cannot enter their place anymore.\" According to my opinion survey, 55% of people in Jalrez (and 63.7% of people in Wardak Province) answered that their current life has become more dangerous compared with their life under the Taliban government (Appendix 1, Q. 22). This result has a sharp contrast with the compliance districts such as Kohistan 1 and Koh Band, where an overwhelming majority of people think that their lives have become safer than their lives under the Taliban government. The survey by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission revealed that among 58 interviewees in Jalrez, 10 persons had families killed during the last 12 months in 2006.\n\nHaji Ghulam Mohammed, who used to be one of the most powerful commanders in Jalrez, responded to my interview and 51 Author's interview with Haji Mohammad Hazrad Janan on 29 May 2008.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan asserted that \"Jalrez is now totally out of control by the government.\" 52 Janan also argues that \"commanders now believe that if they surrender weapons in current conditions, their lives will be endangered. And I frankly agree with their claim on this point.\" 53 One commander, who used to be a commander in Jalrez and now works in a high-ranked position in the Afghan government, told me that \"I used to be a commander in Jalrez and before surrendering weapons I and other commanders were very strong. After we surrendered weapons, Taliban came to our areas. Now, even I cannot return to Jalrez because it is too insecure. Jalrez is under the control of insurgents and the Taliban.\" 54 And if improving the security is an important precondition for DIAG, the methods to improve security is a critical agenda even for enhancing the DIAG process. As one UN high-ranked official argues, \"DIAG without reconciliation is meaningless. We need to have a comprehensive approach in advancing DIAG and reconciliation together; otherwise, it cannot work.\" 55 This agenda of reconciliation as a critical method to improve the security in Afghanistan will be examined in the next chapter. 52 Author's interview with Haji Ghulam Mohammed on 15 June 2008. 53 Author's interview with Haji Mohammad Hazrad Janan on 29 May 2008. 54 Author's interview with a commander who used to live in Jalrez, with a condition of anonymity, in June 2008. 55 Author's interview with a UN high-ranked official, with a condition of anonymity, in June 2008.\n\nWhat are policies to enhance the DIAG process? In the current security situation, it appears not so wise to take coercive methods and confiscate weapons because (1) it would create huge resentment from commanders in local regions who still have powers in Afghanistan, and (2) it would be easy for these commanders to buy new weapons in markets and start attacking the government if they became resentful against the government. It must be much more effective to spread a good reputation and trust of the DIAG program by demonstrating that DIAG continues to satisfy local commanders and people in districts where commanders complied with DIAG. Unfortunately, examining compliance and noncompliance behaviors, this research found a critical problem in terms of implementing DIAG development projects: very slow implementation of DIAG development projects after the compliance rate reached 75%. Without fixing this problem, the DIAG can create a huge mistrust between the government and people (and commanders in regions), which is very opposite to the objectives of DIAG.\n\nIn both Koh Band and Kohistan 1 Districts in Kapisa Province, where commanders surrendered weapons and reached 75% compliance, the implementation of the development projects for DIAG is so slow that commanders who cooperated with DIAG were extremely frustrated and lost their trust in DIAG. Hassam-u-din, a commander in Koh Band, emphasized that \"we did not see any progress in DIAG development projects. We CIR Working Paper No. 47 feel that we were cheated by DIAG.\"foot_29 Meraju-din, the commander in Kohistan 1, seriously insisted that \"I now believe that we were tricked by DIAG and UN officials. Nothing happened after we surrendered weapons.\" 57 Because of their mistrust and frustration, commanders in Kapisa started making \"commander unions\" and started opposing the government. A UN official who covered Kapisa region lamented, \"it is a very dangerous sign for insurgency in the future. They are powerful people, and losing their trust can be very critical.\" 58 This research confirmed that it is not a unique problem for Koh Band and Kohistan 1. As for the overall picture, in 43 districts where the DIAG Joint Secretary asked the MRRD to implement DIAG development projects due to the compliance of commanders, only 2 districts have completed DIAG development projects (as  of 31 August 2008). The problem of the slow implementation of DIAG development projects is now shared by every important actor, such as UNDP, ANBP, UNAMA, the MRRD, and the DIAG Joint Secretariat.\n\nThe key reason for the delay of the projects is misguided identification of DIAG projects: When a district reaches 75%\n\ncompliance, it is mainly the District Development Assembly in each district that identifies DIAG development projects. The District Development Assemblies consist of leaders from the Community Development Councils (CDC), which are community-level development councils. And in many districts that face a delay of projects, the District Development Assembly chose the DIAG development projects, which are much more expensive than the DIAG ceiling (150,000 USD per district). The Koh Band case shows very typical problems of implementing DIAG development projects. In Koh Band, because commanders swiftly cooperated with DIAG, the district started discussion to identify the DIAG development project in early 2007. In April, 2007, the District Development Assembly in Koh Band requested 14 km of road construction, which is vital for their economic activities. In this process, a MRRD official in charge of this district showed the list of projects written in the District Development Plan to the members of the District Development Assembly and asked them to choose a project from the list. The District Development Plan is mainly designed by the MRRD regional offices to identify future development projects for several years to come in each district; and the Plan is, in many cases, authorized by the District Development Assembly in each district. 59 The creation of the District Development Plans across Afghanistan is a part of projects by the National Area Based Development Program (NABDP) implemented by both UNDP and the MRRD. An official of the MRRD office in Kapisa used this list to guide the members of the District Development Assembly in Koh Band to choose the projects for DIAG. This action was actually guided by DIAG, as the \"DIAG concept paper\" clearly asks DIAG projects to be linked with existing programs, such as NABDP. It says, \"The DIAG development 28 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan component will be in line with existing development initiatives (such as NABDP)….it is envisioned that DIAG…would employ the NABDP project implementation structure for delivery of some of the community projects.\" 60 Due to this guidance, it was reasonable for the MRRD officials to use the District Development Plan to guide the District Development Assembly to choose the DIAG project. However, the problem is that the projects on the list of the District Development Plans tend to be much more expensive than the DIAG ceiling because it is the list for \"desires\" to advance development in each region for several years, without a financial basis. In Koh Band, after the District Development Assembly chose road construction as a DIAG project, it took about 6 months just to estimate the cost of the project (the slow estimation of the cost is the second important cause for the delay of DIAG projects, as we will see later). The MRRD engineer teams finally presented a long report on the estimate of the cost for the road construction project and announced that it would cost about 1 million USD, while the DIAG ceiling is 150,000 USD. The MRRD offices in charge of the project in Kapisa tried to combine the DIAG project with a Counter-Narcotics project to cover the cost, but it was rejected by the officials in charge of Counter-Narcotics because the combination of DIAG and Counter-Narcotics is still much lower than the cost of road construction (and combining two different projects is always very difficult at the local level in Afghanistan, due to a lack of experts). As an alternative, the District Development Assembly in Koh Band identified the 60 DIAG Concept Paper written for implementation of DIAG.\n\nconstruction of a school, but it was rejected again due to the high cost of constructing schools. Actually, many other districts also chose schools as the DIAG development project, and their proposals were rejected because of the cost (the average cost for building a school is 220,000 USD). In short, Koh Band had wasted more than one year just in selecting the development project for DIAG.\n\nIn the initial stage of identification, the MRRD officials did not show the DIAG ceiling to the members of the District Development Assembly because they thought that \"the ceiling of DIAG is too low to encourage the commanders to surrender weapons.\"foot_33 There was also no engineer participating in the discussion of selecting the projects, so it was difficult to inform them of approximate estimated costs before they formally identified the projects.\n\nThis practice represents the typical problems of legitimacy construction. The creation of over-expectation without clear explanation about the budget ceiling, as well as the lack of explanation about slow implementation of development projects, just keeps eroding the legitimacy of the domestic government and the international actors in charge of DIAG.\n\nThe research has not clarified how prevalent this practice-using the list of the District Development Plan to identify the DIAG projects-is; however, first, the DIAG concept paper requests DIAG to be linked with NABDP. Second, there is no question that projects identified by many compliance districts were found to cost more than the DIAG ceiling and have been rejected after spending several months to estimate the costs; for example, the project identified in CIR Working Paper No. 47 Kohistan 1 (protection wall) was estimated to cost 700,000 USD; the project identified in Khuram Wa Sarbagh District was estimated to cost over 1 million USD; the project identified in Bangi District was estimated to cost 400,000 USD. There is no doubt that the misguided initial identification is a critical cause for the delay of the DIAG development projects.\n\n(2) Lack of Personnel to Design Projects, Estimate Costs, and Implement Them\n\nThe lack of staff to implement DIAG economic projects is also serious. It takes almost 4 months just to estimate costs of identified projects, while it is possible to complete an estimate in one month in other programs. Thus, what often happens is that 4 or 5 months after commanders fully complied with DIAG weapons collection and districts selected DIAG development projects, commanders heard that DIAG cannot implement the projects due to the budget ceiling. Because the MRRD tends to show the list of big-budget projects (such as the District Development Plan) to give commanders an incentive to surrender weapons, commanders and local leaders perceive they have been \"cheated.\"\n\nIf the DIAG continued to create this sense of \"cheating\" and mistrust in the government, it would create a huge damage to the credibility of the government and the UN agencies in charge of DIAG. It is very serious because the DIAG started the weapon collections in districts where commanders and people tend to be supportive of the government; the government would lose the trust and confidence even in areas supportive of the government.\n\nAnd the slow implementation of DIAG development projects makes it difficult for the DIAG officials to persuade the commanders in newly identified districts to surrender weapons. For example, a DIAG official in charge of persuading commanders to surrender weapons in the regions seriously appealed to me, \"This slow implementation of DIAG development projects in Kapisa is almost going to kill the whole DIAG process. Commanders in newly targeted districts always told me that 'We know what happened to compliance districts such as Koh Band or Kohistan 1: there is no development project implemented. We will not be cheated by DIAG!'\" 62 He also lamented, \"I am also threatened by commanders in Koh Band and Kohistan 1 who have already surrendered weapons because there is no project implemented. Those commanders are losing trust and popularity of their people.\" 63\n\nIt seems obvious that it is urgent to change the practice of implementing DIAG development projects so that the DIAG program, the Afghan government, and international actors such as the UN agencies can restore the trust of commanders and people. From the analyses above, I recommend the following:\n\n(1) In order to make proper identification in the initial stage, the DIAG Joint Secretariat and the MRRD should create a list of projects that can be implemented within the DIAG ceiling and distribute it to each district so that the District Development Assemblies or other district authorities can choose proper projects in the initial identification. It would also be very beneficial 62 Author's interview with one of the IAG officials in charges of Kapisa, with a condition of anonymity, in June 2008. 63 Ibid. 30 30 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan if the MRRD could dispatch one engineer to guide the discussion of the District Development Assembly and give them proper estimates and suggestions for selecting projects.\n\nIt is also important to explain the DIAG ceiling from the beginning; the projects might be modest, but it is critical to give an honest explanation and to implement projects very quickly so that it can enhance the creation of trust between the government and local political leaders (and people); that is the ultimate goal of DIAG.\n\n(2) In order to speed up the implementation, it is also important to increase the DIAG staff to implement DIAG development projects, including experts in designing projects, estimating costs, and procuring materials for projects.\n\nIt is encouraging that both the head of UNDP, Anita Nirody, and the Japanese ambassador, Hideo Sato, recognize the criticality of this problem and started making serious efforts to speed up the implementation of DIAG development projects. (Japan is a major financial contributor to the DIAG.) Their initiative needs to be supported by both Afghan and international authorities.\n\n(3) UNAMA should be mandated to monitor and even supervise the whole process of DIAG; without the UNAMA involvement to supervise whole processes, responsible implementation will continue to be challenged. As for the Koh Band DIAG project, only after UNAMA national staff decided to be deeply involved in selecting projects, by taking a risk of doing tasks beyond their limited mandates, did the provincial governor, MRRD, and DDA members become serious and succeed in selecting projects. It demonstrates how important it is for UNAMA to be clearly mandated to supervise the DIAG process. It is risky and even dangerous for the international actors to depend on local ownership and to escape from its responsibility in such a key political program, when the involvement of the UN is a critical component in the compliance mechanism.\n\nIt may be true that the size of DIAG development projects might be small compared with other development projects. However, because the DIAG is so political and involves key political and military stakeholders in each region, it is very crucial to fulfill the promise of the government in very quick and honest ways so that it can enhance the credibility and trust between the government and local people.\n\nAt the same time, DIAG itself cannot change the regaining insurgency in Afghanistan, which has become a critical impediment for the Afghan reconstruction and the creation of legitimate government in the long run. In order to address this security issue caused by insurgency, this report proceeds to analyze the issue of reconciliation in the next chapter. CIR Working Paper No. 47 Chapter 3: Reconciliation Background: Worsening Security and Hope for Reconciliation The security conditions are deteriorating in Afghanistan. According to the \"Afghanistan Index\" by the Brookings Institution, the estimated number of Afghan civilian fatalities as a direct result of fighting between progovernment forces and anti-government entities jumped from 929 in 2006 to 1633 in 2007. 64 The same trend continues in 2008. The opinion survey conducted by the Asian Foundation in 2007 found that among the Afghans who answered that \"things are going in the wrong direction,\" 48% of the Afghans asserted that it was because of \"insecurity\"; that was the first reason for going in the wrong direction in 2007. 65 In contrast, it was only 6% of Afghans who answered \"insecurity\" as a reason for going in the wrong direction in 2006. 66 The Report of the Secretary-General on 6 March 2008 proclaimed, \"In 2007 the level of insurgent and terrorist activity increased sharply from that of the previous year. An average of 566 incidents per month was recorded in 2007, compared to 425 per month in the previous year…Thirty-six out of 376 districts, including most districts in the east, south-east and south, remain largely inaccessible to Afghan officials and aid workers.\" 67 64 Brookings 2008. \"Afghanistan Index\" on 16 September 2008. The original data comes from Human Rights Watch. 65 The Asia Foundation 2007. \"Afghanistan in 2007\" The Asia Foundation conducted opinion survey in both 2006 and 2007 with more than 6000 Afghan people across the country. 66 Ibid.,13. 67 The Report of Secretary General on 6 March 2008. \"The situation in Afghanistan and its implications for international peace and security.\" Facing the deteriorating security, many leaders of both domestic and international peacebuilders are now calling for a serious negotiation and reconciliation with insurgents, including at least some parts of the Taliban. In September, 2007, Afghan President Hamid Karzai officially called for negotiation with the Taliban in a press conference: \"For the security and prosperity of the Afghan people…we are ready for any type of discussion and negotiations.\" 68 Karzai even offered to meet with Taliban Leader Mullah Omar and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a factional warlord leader, and insisted that if a group of Taliban militants came to Karzai and offered to halt attacks in exchange for a role in government, he would accept. 69 UNAMA, which was mandated for reconciliation by the UN Security Council resolution, is making a serious effort to conduct \"political outreach\" to enhance the reconciliation with various political groups, including insurgents. 70 Christopher Alexander,\n\nthe Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRG), asserted that there might be substantial numbers of insurgent groups who might be sympathetic to the Taliban, and they might feel that they are excluded from the peacebuilding process; thus, \"that is critical for UNAMA to navigate them to think that they are included and they are parts of peacebuilding efforts.\" 71 It appears that this sense of exclusiveness is a critical factor in motivating some factions to be supportive to the insurgency, including the Taliban. 72 He 68 Reuters on 11 September 2007. \"Afghanistan's Karzai urges Taliban to negotiate\" 69 CTV News on 29 September 2007. \"Karzai offers government office to Taliban.\" 70 The UN Security Council Resolution 1806, adopted on 20 March 2008. 71 Author's interview with Christopher Alexander, Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, on 21 February 2008. 72 According to the survey by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, among 58 32 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan emphasized, \"Thus, the reconciliation process should be one of the most important jobs for UNAMA in the next few years.\" 73 ISAF, consisting of NATO, also supports the reconciliation under some conditions. Maurits Jochems, ambassador and NATO senior Civilian Representative, told me that \"NATO supports the reconciliation under some conditions….First, the reconciliation should be led by Afghan authorities; second, the insurgents who reconcile with the government should accept the Afghan constitution; third, they should stop using military approaches.\" 74 And he claims that NATO supports and expects UNAMA to push the reconciliation forward. 75 It is not only domestic and international peacebuilders who are seeking the possibility of reconciliation but also ordinary Afghans; it should be noted that an overwhelming majority of Afghan people strongly support the reconciliation as the only way to establish peace in Afghanistan. According to my opinion survey in June 2008, 94% people surveyed in Kandahar (Pashtun-dominated area), 98% in Wardak (Pashtun-dominated area), and 86% in Kapisa (Kohistan 1 and Koh Band Districts; Tajik-dominated area) responded that reconciliation with insurgent groups, including the Taliban, is the first priority to establish peace in Afghanistan (Appendix 1, Q. 18). It is also important to recognize that 98% in Kandahar, 98% in Wardak, and 70% in villagers in Jalrez district, where the insurgency is very active, 20 villagers answered that they were wrongly excluded from development project because of their tribes and ethnicity. 73 Ibid. 74 Author's interview with Maurits Jochems, Ambassador and NATO Senior Civilian Representative, on 19 June 2008. 75 Ibid.\n\nTaliban (Appendix 1, Q. 19). And 94% in Kandahar, 97% in Wardak, and 69% in Kapisa answered that they support the coalition because it is necessary to establish peace in Afghanistan (Appendix 1, Q. 20).\n\nIn 2007, Environics, the Canadian research group, surveyed 1578 Afghan people across the country and found a similar trend; 74% of people in Afghanistan and 85% in Kandahar Province supported the negotiation between the Karzai government and the Taliban. 76 With regard to the idea of a coalition government in which the Karzai government shares power with the Taliban, 54% of people in the country and 74% in Kandahar support the idea. 77 These results seem consistent with the result of my own survey, considering many people in the North, especially Hazara people who were so harshly oppressed by the Taliban regime, must dislike the idea of the coalition. The worsening security might also increase the support for negotiation and reconciliation in 2008.\n\nThus, there seems to be a consensus among international peacebuilders, domestic peacebuilders, and ordinary people about a critical need to advance more inclusiveness and the reconciliation with insurgents, including the Taliban. However, how is it possible? Is it actually practical or feasible? In order to address these questions, we need to start asking who the Taliban are. Without defining the Taliban, it must be difficult to judge whether or not negotiating with the Taliban is possible.\n\nThere seems to be two major different views about what the Taliban is and whether reconciliation is possible. One view was represented by Ahmed Wali Karzai, who is a younger brother of President Karzai, the Chief of the Provincial Council in Kandahar, and seen as the most powerful government figure in Kandahar Province. He asserts that although negotiation with the Taliban is the most important agenda, as the government cannot kill everybody, it is almost impossible to negotiate with the Taliban \"because the Taliban is invisible.\" 78In his view, the Taliban is an insurgent organization that is led by leaders who always hide themselves in a foreign country and is actually supported or even controlled by a foreign country, namely Pakistan. He claims, \"We know who are behind insurgency in other countries; we know their leaders by names, but they are not visible. They keep hiding themselves on the other side of the territory. We have not seen them....How can we negotiate with the leaders who are not visible?\" 79 Asked about the call by the President Karzai for reconciliation, he responded, \"We are calling for reconciliation by asking 'where are you'? But there is no response from the other side. In fact, we are reconciling but they are hiding!\" 80 In sum, Ahmed Wali Karzai asserted that because negotiation and reconciliation is possible only when they can talk with the leadership of opponents, it is actually impossible to reconcile with the Taliban. Because of this view about the Taliban and 78 Author's interview with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Chief of Provincial Council in Kandahar Province, on 8 June 2008. 79 Ibid. 80 Ibid.\n\nthe reconciliation, the only solution for the insurgency in Afghanistan, in his view, is to fight against the Taliban stationed in Pakistan.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a different view about the components of the Taliban. Hanaitullah Kochai, who is the Provincial Council member in Kapisa Province and lives in Tagab District (insurgency-active district), argued that \"if there are 420 Taliban soldiers in Tagab, 400 are working for the Taliban to obtain 100 USD per month as the Taliban gives them salary; thus, those 400 soldiers are not ideologically driven. It is only 20 Taliban soldiers who are ideologically driven and actually controlled by Pakistan.\" 81 In that sense, Kochai asserted, \"We can negotiate with those 400 soldiers and persuade them to the side of the government if the government can provide them with jobs and security.\"foot_37 But unfortunately, Kochai emphasized, \"People in our district feel that the government did nothing for them in the last several years.\" 83 The view of Kochai-a majority of the Taliban soldiers are cooperating or working for the Taliban to obtain economic needs and their own security (those Taliban soldiers can keep at least physical security if they work for the Taliban in areas where there is no progovernment police and army, including international forces)-is shared by many government officials, UN officials, highranked officials of members states (including some ambassadors), and a majority of ordinary Afghan people.\n\nFor example, Najibullah Mojadidi, the acting director of the PTS program (the national reconciliation program in Afghanistan that will 34 34 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan be explained in more detail in the following sections), explained what the Taliban offers to the ordinary Afghan: \"Because we are constantly talking with former Taliban soldiers, we know what the Taliban offers to them. If people join the Taliban and fight against the government, they can obtain 100 USD per month; if they conduct kidnapping by following orders of the Taliban, they can get about 400 USD per month; and if they conduct suicide attacks, their family will gain economic guarantee for their entire lives.\" 84 It is also told that the Taliban in the South give credit to the farmers who produce poppy and cooperate with the Taliban prior to their cultivation of the poppy, so those farmers can obtain economic benefits even if their poppy products might be confiscated by the government. Thus, according to one UN official in Kandahar, it cannot be denied that there is some economic benefit for farmers in the South to cooperate with the Taliban. Mohammad Shapoor, Colonel from the Ministry of Defense in charge of the security in Wardak Province (Pashtun area), also asserted, \"As long as there is no job and facility to work for people, people will do anything to survive. Once they have jobs, they will be very busy at their work and will have no reasons to fight. That is why we need to have reconciliation with those people.\" 85 Likewise, one villager from Maydan Shahr district (Pashtun) answered my opinion survey and said, \"Some of the Taliban are fighting to make a complete Islamic state here. But some of them are working just for money.\" One villager from Koh Band district (Tajik) in Kapisa Province said, \"I agree with the idea of negotiation or even coalition with the Taliban if they are Afghan Taliban. I disagree with foreign Taliban, such as Pakistan Taliban or al-Qaida because they have objectives to create conflict in Afghanistan.\" In addition to this view that a majority of the Taliban soldiers are working for economic and social needs, there is a shared understanding that Afghanistan consists of various tribes, and those tribes can be swayed between the pro-government and the anti-government, depending on their perception and trust in the government and the Taliban. Jelani Popal, the Director General of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), and one of the closest officials to President Karzai, insisted that \"the community or tribes in Afghanistan at village level are so strong that if a community has a consensus that they will not allow the Taliban to enter, it becomes very difficult for the Taliban to enter that community…Now the communities do not think that the current government is good, so they are indifferent to the government. They are not Taliban but they are not progovernment either.\" 86 Thus, he asserted, \"We need to have strong integrated approaches to take these communities to the side of the government, by improving local governance including police and justices, following promises for people, and reconstructing economic activities in communities.\" 87 Mohammad Ehsan Zia, the Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), and one of the most respected ministers in the Afghan government, said that \"there are mainly two categories of Afghan 35 CIR Working Paper No. 47\n\npeople; one is the supporters of the government, and the second is the people who are waiting and thinking about which side they should support… Many people want to participate in the reconstruction of our country and restore the life of their family. We need to satisfy these needs and hopes of people to pull them to the side of the government.\" 88 One Afghan security expert, who lives in Kandahar and works for one of the international organizations, explained the relationship between the insurgents (including the Taliban) and the local government: \"Those insurgent groups or illegal armed groups are double-hand shaking; during night, they might shake hands with the Taliban, do some criminal activities, and become threats to the government, but during the daytime, they might shake hands with the government. The reason is that those people are not sure about the credibility of the current government… Thus it is critical for the government to obtain trust and credibility of people.\" 89 If accepting these views, it seems plausible to categorize three complements of the Taliban.\n\n(1) Core members of the Taliban, including al-Qaida or some groups coming from foreign states. (2) Afghan Taliban who are fighting to obtain economic needs and security. (3) Various (and numerous) tribes and communities that can be swayed between the government and antigovernment elements, including the Taliban.\n\n88 Author's interview with Mohammad Ehsan Zia, the Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), on 31 May 2008. 89 Author's interview with one Afghan security expert living in Kandahar province, with a condition of anonymity, in June 2008. It must be important to have different strategies for different categories of the Taliban.\n\nThere is a shared a view that under current Afghan conditions, reconciliation with the core members of the Taliban seems extremely difficult because the core members of the Taliban seem not to have any incentive to make substantial concessions to the Afghan government, due to their ideological structure as well as their gaining territorial control. Popal, the director of IDLG, claimed that \"reconciliation can work only when you are strong compared with your opponents. Now the Taliban is confident, so reconciliation with them must be very difficult, although we are open to everybody as long as they accept our constitution and the harmony of the state.\"foot_43 Minister Zia also argued that he was very pessimistic about reconciliation with the Taliban core members because of their ideological stances and origins: \"Can we negotiate with al-Qaida?... In reality, Afghan Taliban leaders do not have authority to control the Taliban insurgency. It is al-Qaida and other international terrorists who make a decision on their fates. At the same time, I argue that it is also critical for the government-and peacebuilders as a whole in Afghanistan-to open the window for reconciliation with even core members of the Taliban because it is always important to show an \"exit strategy\" for these insurgents so that they can be a part of the government if they lay down their weapons and accept the constitution, as President Karzai insisted last year. Fighting the insurgents without giving them an \"exit strategy\" would push them to the corner and make them fight back for a long time. In PTS, first, an individual soldier sends an application with his or her promise not to conduct any military attacks against the government and to follow the Afghan constitution, as well as the signatures of key local political figures, such as chiefs of police in their districts, district governors, and tribe leaders. The PTS committee will review the applications, and if appropriate, the Afghan government sends them the letters to promise not to detain or kill those individuals. There are about 4600 individuals who joined PTS by the end of 2007.\n\nUnfortunately, the PTS has already lost credibility from both Afghan people and the international community. The main reasons are the following:\n\n(1) Taliban members who joined PTS have no guarantee of safety from the international forces, especially from American counterterrorism operations.\n\nThere are several prominent cases in which members who joined PTS were attacked by American forces. For example, in Alasay District in Kapisa Province, one former Taliban commander, known as Hafizallah, who controlled over 50 Taliban former soldiers, was invited by the Provincial Council members in Kapisa to join PTS and work for the provincial government. Hafizallah formally joined PTS in summer of 2007 and actively cooperated with the provincial government. Abdul Wahaab, who is a Provincial Council member in Kapisa living in Alasay District, emphasized that \"I talked with Hafizallah to work with us to support the provincial government. And I and the Chief of Provincial Council persuaded Hafizallah to join PTS.\" 92\n\nAs a result, Hafizallah formally joined the PTS and got the letter from the government to prove that he was admitted as a PTS member who reconciled with the government. Two months later (in the fall of 2007), he was invited by U.S. forces to come to Graham Base for a meeting and was arrested by U.S. forces. 93 Wahaab and Kochai, another Provincial Council member in Kapisa, emphasized that they did not know any reason why Hafizallah was arrested by the U.S. forces. Wahaab asserted that Hafizallah was supposed to bring his 50 subordinates to join the PTS and reconcile with the 92 Author's interview with Abdul Wahaab, a Provincial Council member in Kapisa Province, on 3 June 2008. 93 This fact was well known to not only Afghan provincial council members but also UN officials covering the area.\n\nCIR Working Paper No. 47 government. However, after this arrest, those people from Alasay District stopped joining PTS.\n\nThus, Wahaab asked UN officials as well as the head of the PTS program, Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, the chair of the Upper House in the Parliament, to ask the U.S. forces to release Hafizallah because \"he was really cooperative with the government and the Provincial Council in Kapisa.\" 94 But nothing happened after their appeals. In the end, \"people in our district do not trust us (Provincial Council members) with regard to PTS.\" 95 This story was spread all over the central regions. There is also a largely shared perception that PTS members were attacked by air bombs of the U.S. counterterrorism operations (Operation Enduring Freedom), which sometimes created civilian casualties as well.\n\n(2) Taliban members who joined PTS have no way to make a living after they cut links to and salaries from Taliban.\n\nIt is obvious that former Taliban soldiers who joined PTS tend to have extreme difficulty making a living after they terminate the links to the Taliban, when the overall employment situation in Afghanistan is very harsh. Najibullah Mojadidi, the acting director of PTS, lamented, \"While the Taliban offers each soldier 100 USD per month for salaries, we cannot give them anything!\" 96 Haji Aghalalai, the head of the PTS office in Kandahar Province and one of the Provincial Council members in Kandahar, also emphasized that economic difficulty after 94 Author's interview with Abdul Wahaab, a Provincial Council member in Kapisa Province, on 3 June 2008. Kochi and other provincial council members also agreed with Wahaab on this point. 95 Ibid. 96 Author's interview with Najibullah Mojadidi, the Acting Director of PTS program, on 17 February 2008.\n\njoining PTS, such as lack of jobs and houses, is a key impediment for inviting the Taliban soldiers to join PTS. This also creates distance between the government and former solders joining PTS, he said. \"The government, including the former President Mojadidi, even promised Taliban soldiers that they would get jobs, houses, and political rights, if they joined PTS. But, unfortunately we did not follow any of these promises so far. It created a big mistrust among the people who might think about PTS and join it.\" 97 It was true that the head of PTS, Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, tried to create financial programs to support the former Taliban who joined the PTS, but the program has not been realized. Aghalalai lamented, \"This office itself gets only 600 USD per month; thus we do not have enough cars, equipment, and other expenditures to operate our program. How can we then support the former soldiers who joined PTS?\" 98\n\n(3) Taliban members who joined PTS would be targets of Taliban retaliations, and the government cannot protect them.\n\nIf the Taliban try to retaliate against those who join PTS, it is difficult for the government to protect them, as in many Pashtundominated areas there is no functioning police. Aghalalai claimed, \"The former Taliban soldiers who joined PTS hide their documents and go back to the rural areas where they live. But when the Taliban ask those PTS members to attack the government again, those people would refuse to cooperate. Then, they are in great danger because the Taliban would kill them in retaliation.\" 99 Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Chief of Provincial Council in Kandahar, also argued, \"If the government needs to protect 97 Author's interview with Haji Aghalalai, the Head of PTS office in Kandahar, on 10 June 2008. 98 Ibid. 99 Ibid.\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan every Taliban who reconciled with the government, how many people will have to be protected by the government? We simply cannot protect so many individuals.\" 100\n\nFor the reasons above, it appears that the PTS has already lost credibility among Afghan people. There is also concern about PTS credibility and accountability among the international community. 101 Thus, it is very difficult for the international community to provide PTS with substantial funding for massive economic projects in coordination with the reconciliation program.\n\nThat is why I propose that it is vital for UNAMA to initiate rearranging a new reconciliation committee composed of every important actor, such as the Presidential Office, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, UNAMA, ISAF, and American Counterterrorism Forces. The existing PTS commission can be integrated into this new committee. Then, this new committee can take the following steps.\n\n(1) Set clear goals and strategies for all peacebuilders, including U.S. counterterrorism forces, ISAF, UNAMA, and top leaders in the Afghan government.\n\n(2) Start a massive program to create vocational centers all over the country for both Taliban soldiers who join in the reconciliation and other non-Taliban people.\n\n100 Author's interview with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Chief of Provincial Council in Kandahar Province, on 8 June 2008. 101 Several UN officials claimed that PTS asked noninsurgents to send applications to demonstrate that the program is working.\n\n(3) Pass a UN resolution to remove the Taliban members from the UN Sanction list if they join in the new reconciliation program. It would shake the \"moderate Taliban leaders.\" (4) Negotiate with \"national Taliban,\" who dislike the al-Qaida or Pakistan-driven terrorist infusions; it may open the window to include \"national Taliban\" in the government structure.\n\n(1) It is crucial for UNAMA to initiate talks between the Afghan government, International Forces, American Forces, and UNAMA to share clear goals and strategies. President Karzai's decision to deport two international staff who contacted heads of the Taliban organization stopped many UNAMA staff from attempting reconciliation efforts with insurgent commanders and groups.\n\nAccording to my opinion survey, 100% in Kandahar, 96% in Wardak, and 80% in Kapisa responded that they support the idea that if the Taliban surrender their weapons, the Afghan government should allow the Taliban to participate in the next election. (Appendix 1, Q. 17) Many top leaders in the Afghan government also argue that they can accept the Taliban if they lay down their weapons and accept the Afghan constitution. It is critical to set clear goals on the reconciliation and share them among key domestic and international peacebuilders in Afghanistan.\n\nThen, when the new reconciliation committee issues a guarantee to former Taliban soldiers who join the new reconciliation program, the guarantee should be shared by every actor. It can guarantee, at least, safety from international forces.\n\nIt is not actually a huge step, at least in theory. The current PTS is supposed to give former Taliban the guarantee of no custody or attack from both Afghan government and CIR Working Paper No. 47 ISAF (international forces); only American forces will join the new committee. It is vital to have every actor in the same boat for the reconciliation.\n\n(2) After clear goals and strategies are confirmed by the main actors above, the new reconciliation committee would start a massive program to create vocational centers all over the country. The significant way to encourage former Taliban soldiers to join the reconciliation is to create sustainable job opportunities after the reconciliation; and many vocational centers in entire regions can encourage many \"Afghan Taliban soldiers\" to join the new reconciliation program. (Many Pakistanis come to Kandahar to work in construction jobs, as many Afghans do not have skills for those jobs; vocational centers can create substantial job opportunities.foot_45 ) It may be important for vocational centers to accept both former Taliban joining in reconciliation and other non-Taliban villagers, because it can treat both former Taliban and non-Taliban equally; it also might have a preventive effect on Taliban retaliation because of the popularity of vocational centers in communities.\n\nThe need to increase employment opportunities is very urgent; according to my opinion poll, 46% in Kandahar and Wardak and 36% in Kapisa answered that their employment is worse compared with three years ago. As I will write in the next section, projects by the Community Development Council (CDC) are extremely popular among Afghan people. When vocational centers decide the program of training, it will be beneficial to consult with CDC members and try to create the best training programs for different industries and agriculture in each region.\n\nIn short, training programs can be linked with future CDC economic projects as well as small credit programs in creating small enterprises in local areas, such as the Afghan Rural Enterprise Development Program. It can create more sustainable job opportunities.\n\n(3) Additionally, to enhance the reconciliation with core but flexible Taliban leaders, it is crucial for the UN Security Council to make a new resolution that if Taliban on the UN Sanction list decide to join the new reconciliation program, they will be removed from the list (Now there are about 20 Taliban former leaders on the list who already joined PTS). This discussion has continued for 4 years in the UN Security Council; it is time to make a critical decision to induce some Taliban leaders to the side of government.\n\n(4) Although it may be difficult to induce concessions from core members of the Taliban, especially Pakistan-or al-Qaidadriven Taliban who are \"international Taliban,\" it is still possible to negotiate with \"Afghan Taliban\" whose main objective is to control their country themselves and who need to have economic opportunities for survival. One of the critical policies could be to reconcile with these \"national insurgents\" and transform them into government officials, including local security forces or police who can be paid a sufficient salary and receive physical protection from the Taliban's retaliation. It is important for the government to obtain clearcut control over these new government officials, but it is also crucial to give them incentive to support the government and to exclude the Pakistan-or al-Qaida-driven Taliban from their community. 103\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan\n\nIt is crucial to implement those policies simultaneously in very decisive ways so that both domestic and international peacebuilders in Afghanistan can show a clear political will to reconcile with the insurgents if they lay down weapons and accept the constitution. That is actually the principle which has already been adopted by the government in the existing reconciliation program, such as PTS.\n\nInternational Forces are still important to increase the cost for the Taliban to fight and to push \"national Taliban\" commanders and soldiers to consider reconciliation with the government. But without reconciliation, military operations alone can push them into a corner and decisive fighting for a long time in the future. In that sense, those military operations need to have very high-level coordination with political programs, including reconciliation. Afghanistan has only one year left before the next presidential election. It is time to make a decision on reconciliation.\n\ninsurgents who disliked the Al-Qaida elements in Iraq and paying payroll of 365 USD per month to these national Iraqi insurgents. Now US forces support about 100,000 former Iraqi insurgents by this payroll; Steven Simon (2008) argues in the journal Foreign Affairs that this policy is the biggest factor that has drastically reduced the Iraqi attacks against the US forces since 2007. US forces claim that a half of the payroll will start to be paid by the Iraqi government in the future (CNN 9 September 2008).\n\nThere is a shared consensus among both domestic and international peacebuilders that the improvement of living conditions by resource distribution (or peace dividends) is critical in constructing the legitimacy of newly created governments in post-conflict situations. For example, Jelani Popal, the Director General of the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), asserted that \"I always emphasize that the legitimacy of the government does not come only from votes of elections; the legitimacy is created by two important components: one is the security, such as physical security, food security, and job security; the second is public services, which enable Afghan people to perceive that their living conditions are getting better. Those two are the most important components for constructing legitimacy.\" 104 While almost all peacebuilders define the improvement of living conditions as one of critical factors in constructing legitimacy, many domestic peacebuilders-the Afghan government official in this case-urged that the assistance projects should be conducted through the government so that people can perceive that their living conditions are getting better because of the government's efforts. Ehsan Zia, the Minister of the Rural Rehabilitation & Development emphasized that \"after 23 years' war, the Afghan state lost 104 Author's interview with Jelani Popal, the Director of the Independent Directorate of the Local Governance, on 4 June 2008 its legitimacy in the eyes of Afghan people…In order to restore the legitimacy of the government, the government should be seen as a leader of state-building and statereconstruction; people need to see that it is their government that leads the reconstruction of their states, offers public service, and improves their living conditions.\"foot_47 Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, the Minister of Finance, also claimed that there are two fundamental merits to flow the international assistance through the government: \"First, if the assistance is implemented through the government, the cost of the implementation is much cheaper; second, the government can obtain more legitimacy from the people and then more stability, which is beneficial for both Afghan people and the international community.\"foot_48 Arian Sharifi, the spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, added, \"The Afghan government uses only 30% of all money from the international community. The other 70% is directly conducted by donor states; that might not damage the legitimacy of the government, but it certainly will not improve it.\" 107 The 2007 national fiscal budget in Afghanistan shows that 77.9% of the total budget was the \"external budget\" that was spent directly by international donors, while 22.1% of the total budget was the government budget composed of \"operating budget\" and \"development budget.\"foot_50\n\nThis claim is echoed at the level of the local government. Rona Terren, the director of Women's Affairs in the Kandahar provincial government, insisted that international donors do not consult with local government officials in terms of their assistance projects. For example, she is meeting a number of women who have problems such as domestic violence and economic difficulties on daily basis; thus, she and her department know the needs of the females in Kandahar, but donors tend to implement the projects even for women without consulting with her and her department. She stressed, \"The foreign assistance should be conducted thorough or in consultation with the government; otherwise, it will not strengthen the credibility of the local government.\" 109 On the other hand, the international community, especially donor states, has substantial skepticism and concern about the accountability and corruption of local authorities. Terren admitted, \"Corruption is the biggest problem in this country; there is so much corruption at every level in Afghanistan. It makes everything difficult.\" Thus, she concluded, \"The international donors need to find good officials who can be trusted to deal with assistance programs, and these programs need to be monitored by donors in transparent ways.\" 110 In general, after 7 years has passed since the reconstruction effort started-it may mean that the government starts having some capability to implement various projects-the claim by the Afghan governments for \"local ownership with regard to assistance projects\" is persuasive and million USD. 109 Author's interview with Rona Tereen, the Director of Women's Affairs in Kandahar Provincial government, on 10 June 2008. 110 Ibid.\n\nstrong. As long as monitoring and accountability is going to be strengthened, the local ownership of the assistance program should be encouraged.\n\nAnita Nirody, the Country Director of UNDP in Afghanistan, summarized the argument: \"In the Paris conference in 2008, the Afghan government, headed by the Minister of Finance, Ahadi, made a strong case why the international assistance should be flowed through the government to increase the credibility and efficiency of the assistance for the people…The international community in Paris strongly endorsed this argument that the international assistance needs to be conducted through the channel of the local government.\"foot_51 She added, \"Of course, there are concerns by the international donors on the accountability of the programs and on how the concerns of their taxpayers can be dealt with; and in order to address these concerns, the monitoring system to secure the accountability should continue to be strengthened.\" But in the overall picture, \"there is optimism about a consensus that more and more assistance should be implemented through the government's channels.\"foot_52\n\nTo address this question of the relationship among local ownership, resource distribution, and construction of legitimacy, the research focused one of the biggest rural development projects in Afghanistan: the National Solidarity Program (NSP) that funds the community development projects by CIR Working Paper No. 47 establishing a Community Development Council (CDC) in each village across the country. The NSP is one of the six initial national priority programs that were introduced under the National Development Framework in 2003. 113 The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation & Development (MRRD) collaborated with the World Bank and initiated this program with a budget of 800 million USD that is planned to be spent by the end of 2009. 114 The NSP is \"by far the largest government program in the country in terms of financing and geographical reach.\" 115 There are two core objectives of the NSP: one is to reduce the poverty at the community level by establishing CDCs in almost all villages across Afghanistan and mobilizing the CDCs with participatory approaches; the second is to recreate the sense of national unity and reunification of each community. 116 Each CDC can be established by the participation of at least 25 local villagers. The key mechanism of the NSP is that after the CDC is established by local people, the CDC itself can identify or choose projects that they want to have. The implementation partners-mainly local and international NGOs-help the CDC to make designs and applications for the projects. If approved, each CDC can obtain economic projects that have a maximum budget of 60,000 USD. 117 Because of the Afghan people's strong desire and passion to obtain economic projects to improve their living conditions, the CDC 113 Brick 2008, 1. 114 Zakhilwal & Thomas 2008 & the author's interview with one of directors in charge of NSP in MRRD in May 2008. 115 Zakhilwal & Thomas 2008, 161. 116 Author's interview with one of directors in charge of NSP in MRRD in May 2008. 117 NSP Guideline by the MRRD. projects drastically expanded in the last several years. According to MRRD, 20,782 CDCs were established across 34 provinces in Afghanistan by 24 May 2008, and MRRD aims to create about 32,000 CDCs in total by the end of 2009, when the \"Phase II of NSP\" is terminated. 118 (The NSP \"Phase I\" started in 2003 and was terminated in 2006; the \"Phase II\" started in 2006 and will be terminated by the end of 2009.) The NSP is funded largely through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and supported by numerous bilateral and multilateral donors. The NSP mobilized 463 million USD by May 2008. How do the local Afghan people perceive the impacts of the CDC projects on their life? The opinion survey I conducted revealed a surprising support for the CDC projects among local Afghan people. It shows that 92% in Kandahar, 84% in Wardak, and 95% in Kapisa answered that they are satisfied with results of the CDC. (Appendix 1, Q. 6). Why? A majority of people answered that it is because (1) they can make decisions about the projects they implement; (2) they can see improvement in their lives due to the CDC projects (Appendix 1, Q. 7). Many villagers I interviewed, including a villager in Kandahar province, argued that \"the CDC project was only hope that we could see since the nation-building started in Afghanistan in 2001.\" 119 A local leader in Kapisa Province emphasized that \"we are very happy that we start having electricity because of the small hydro energy generators constructed by the CDC projects. It substantially increased the trust of our community in the government.\" 120 It seems 44 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan clear that in the economic development programs, local ownership does matter in improving their living conditions and enhancing the trust in the government, thus its legitimacy. Ehsan Zia, the Minister of MRRD, asserted that 95% to 98% of all CDC projects are properly maintained after they are implemented because \"people are very enthusiastic about their projects they identified themselves.\" 121 Moreover, CDC projects are more likely to be protected by the community and more immune to insurgent attacks than other government projects, he emphasized. For example, \"about 160 schools across the country were destroyed by the Taliban under the Karzai government, but no school that was build as a CDC project was destroyed by the Taliban. It is because the Taliban cannot afford to confront local people due to the support and popularity of people for their CDC projects.\" 122 Problem of CDC Projects The critical challenge for the CDC projects and NSP as a whole, though, is the sustainability of CDC projects. If the Afghan National Trust Fund stops sending funds to CDCs when the Phase II of NSP is completed at the end of 2009, can the CDCs still continue to function, especially to implement new community development projects? 121 Author's interview with Ehsan Zia, the Minister of the Rural Rehabilitation & Development on 31 May 2008. 122 Ibid. One concern, however, is the security of CDC projects is also threatened, especially in South because the Taliban distribute warning letters to the villages that if they cooperate for CDCs, they will be punished by the Taliban. One of the villagers in Kandahar Province showed me the warning letter that he received from the Taliban organization. There are two systematic studies with regard to the sustainability of the CDC projects. The Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit and Jennifer Brick conducted intensive research about the sustainability of the CDCs in 32 villages across 16 districts in six provinces.foot_56 Based on their research, Brick concluded, \"It is clear that without project funds, CDCs will disappear. The speed at which CDCs have begun to fade suggests that CDCs do not yet have strong roots in the community.\"foot_57 Likewise, Zakhilwal and Thomas conducted research in 29 villages in five provinces and concluded, \"Observations in the villages visited raise questions about the sustainability of CDCs; and it is this that could pose the biggest risk to local governance and community-based development.\n\nWithin the international aid community and MRRD there is high hope for the CDCs, but their future depends on many complex realities. If these CDCs fail, it will take a very long time to build up enough trust to enable such efforts to work again.\" 125 While there are some CDCs that have started collecting funds from villagers and tried to start their own projects, it would be very difficult for a majority of CDCs to keep implementing new projects if the funds from international donors stopped (It may happen in the end of 2009). At the same time, a vast majority of Afghan people strongly desire the continuation of the CDC projects, while many people also want to increase the budget of CDC projects (Appendix 1, Q. 9).\n\nBased on the information and analyses above, I make recommendations on (1) the NSP and (2) international assistance in Afghanistan in general.\n\n(1) With regard to NSP (and CDC projects), it is urgent to create an international fund mechanism to sustain the NSP that will keep the implementation of the CDC projects in each village.\n\nThe research suggests that the continuation of the CDC projects at the community level is vital in maintaining and increasing the trust of the people in the government, which started to be created through the implementation of CDC development projects. The termination of CDC projects would destroy the trust between people and the government if more than 30,000 CDCs stopped functioning after only one or two projects were implemented by each CDC.\n\nIn order to make CDC projects more sustainable (as the international community probably cannot afford to support CDCs forever), one of the key programs could be to encourage CDCs to initiate new projects that create opportunities for long-term employment, such as irrigation or food processing. The possible vocational centers for reconciliation could be linked with long-term projects by CDCs.\n\nIt is alleged that the Ministry of Finance is opposing the proposal by MRRD to continue the NSP after 2009. But the Minister of Finance, Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, refuted the allegation: \"I do oppose the continuation of the NSP without reviewing the impacts of the NSP; thus, the impacts of NSP should be examined by an independent body, and we need to make a decision based on fair and objective reviews.\" 126 126 Author's interview with Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, the Several studies, including this one, indicate that it is critical for the NSP to continue direct community investments in each village so that people can perceive the linkage between their lives and the government and then increase their confidence in the state regime in Afghanistan. The termination of the CDC projects, especially at the critical moment of the presidential election in 2009 and parliament elections in 2010, is extremely risky with regard to increasing the legitimacy of the government.\n\n(2) With regard to the international assistance in general, the projects by the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT)-which are created by the international forces in each region and are one of the major parts of \"external flow\" that are directly spent by international actors-must have more substantial discussions with Afghan local governments at both provincial and district levels. The PRT projects need to be perceived as the result of collaboration between the local governments and the PRT so that the achievement of projects can increase the legitimacy of local governments.\n\nMany local government officials complained that the PRT projects did not substantially contribute to the increase of trust in local governments in Afghanistan. A former governor in one province lamented, \"I did not get any serious discussion from the PRT covering my province before the PRT implemented their projects; on the other hand, my proposals about the projects that could have been assisted by the PRT were never accepted by the PRT and continued to be rejected. I do not think that they understood the needs of our people and struggles of the local governments to increase the trust of people.\" 127 Minister of Finance, on 28 June 2008. 127 Author's interview with a former governor in one\n\nChapter 5: Lesson from the Past in Afghanistan: Missed Opportunities?\n\nThe research also identified the hypothetical missed opportunities that might have substantially changed the course of the peacebuilding in Afghanistan. Although we cannot change the past, it is important to learn lessons from the past; those lessons give us precious insights on how to improve both ongoing and future peacebuilding efforts in the world, including the current effort in Afghanistan.\n\nThere are several missed opportunities that were expressed by top government and UN officials: (1) reconciliation with the Taliban in 2002 or 2003, (2) massive economic and social projects to improving living conditions in the first 6 months, (3) creation of a much simpler electoral system, (4) more roles for the UN in maintaining security, although this issue is most controversial. Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan threats, we might need to make a substantial concession, but we also need to make sure that the peace process or reconciliation process would not endanger the core values of our constitution….That was why it was a mistake not to start the negotiation with the Taliban when they were weak and desperate.\" 134 Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, the Minister of Finance, principally agreed with Brahimi's claim, but explained why it was difficult, especially for the international community, to accept the reconciliation with the Taliban at that time: \"Until recently, we actually took it for granted that the peace would continue in Afghanistan. We went to London in 2006 for an international conference and I was sure that the international community thought that Afghanistan was a success story. There was no recognition at that time that something very difficult should be done to maintain the security in Afghanistan.\" 135 Masoom Stanekzai, the advisor to the President and virtually No. 1 Afghan official in charge of Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups (DIAG), was very explicit about this reconciliation issue. He stressed, \"The timing must be critical for the peacebuilding and reconciliation. One of the biggest lessons from Afghan peacebuilding is that both the Afghan government and the international community did not start the reconciliation effort with the Taliban in 2002, 2003, or even 2004; the international community did not listen to us….It was so easy, for example in 2003, to reconcile or regroup the Taliban. It was the biggest missed opportunity. And that is the historical lesson from the Afghan peacebuilding.\" 136 Stanekzai concluded, \"It is 134 Ibid. 135 Author's interview with Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi, the Minister of Finance, on 28 June 2008. 136 Author's interview with Masoom Stanekzai, advisor to President & Vice Chairman of Disarmament and Reintegration (D&R) Committee, so crucial for peacebuilders to have reconciliation in the initial stage of peacebuilding, but people tend to start thinking about the reconciliation only when it becomes too late and only when governments cannot stop or control the insurgency.\" 137\n\nReconciliation in the initial stage of peacebuilding, when former enemies are very weak and marginalized, seems a key lesson for future peacebuilding. With regard to the current peacebuilding effort in Afghanistan, this lesson indicates that the international community and the Afghan government might need to recognize that they probably must pay higher costs now for reconciliation with insurgent groups, such as providing job opportunities to insurgents, creating high-level army and police, and negotiating with numerous individual tribes to invite them to the side of the government, as discussed in the previous chapter.\n\nThere is a unified voice on how critical it is to improve the living conditions in the first 6 months after peacebuilding starts. But the international community tends to focus on political dimensions and forget about the importance of economic and social improvements in the initial stage. Salvator Lombardo, the Representative of UNHCR in Afghanistan, insisted that \"some observers argue that state builders should concentrate much more on delivering service to people in the initial stages of peacebuilding, and I tend to agree with this argument because in the place which has been devastated by years' conflicts, the on 18 February 2008. 137 Ibid.\n\ndelivery of services to citizens in the initial stage of state building is absolutely critical, maybe much more critical than having a constitution.\" 138 He also emphasized the importance of the timing: \"The first six months is most important because you can enjoy good atmosphere and cooperation of people expecting a better future. On the other hand, without making individual citizens feel that a new system is making their lives different from those in the past, the state legitimacy would gradually disappear.\" 139 There is a general observation that the peacebuilders tend to have too much emphasis on advancing the political process, such as conducting elections and creating new constitutions. The suggestion by Lombardo-the critical need to improve the living conditions of ordinary people in the initial stages of peacebuilding-should be recognized as a lesson for future peacebuilding.\n\nThis argument would raise the other question about how the delivery of services, or improvement of living conditions in initial stage of peacebuilding, should be conducted, especially in terms of respecting local ownership or the involvement of local citizens. The research then examined the\n\nquestion, for example, whether or not community-based development projects participated in and identified by local people, as the National Solidarity Program (NSP) has conducted Community Development Councils (CDC) projects since 2003, can be implemented in the very initial stage of peacebuilding, even in the first six months of Afghan peacebuilding. 138 Author's interview with Salvatore Lombardo, Representative of the UNHCR in Afghanistan on 19 June 2008. 139 Ibid.\n\nMany officials, who were in charge of the NSP, asserted that it was impossible to start such a big scale of projects as the NSP in the first six months of peacebuilding. \"Due to the scale of the programs and the need for the coordination with international funds, it was too difficult, thus not realistic to start programs like NSP in the first six months of the peacebuilding.\"foot_62 Sadako Ogata, the president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency and a former head of the UNHCR, also argued that \"I visited Afghanistan for its reconstruction just after the Taliban regime was collapsed. And there was no government building or institutional capability left in Afghanistan at that time. It was not realistic to conduct assistance through the government when there was no functioning government; thus, the importance is to transit the assistance projects that would be directly implemented by the international donors in the initial stage to the projects that have more emphasis on local ownership in later stages.\" 141 In sum, it appears to be very critical to improve living conditions of people with massive economic projects that would be directly implemented by international peacebuilders in the very initial stage of postconflict reconstruction (and the first six months could be an important target for international peacebuilders). At the same time, the international peacebuilders can start preparing for assistance projects that respect and utilize local ownership-for example, encouraging the local people to participate in identifying and implementing the projectsfor the second stage of peacebuilding, as the 50\n\nChallenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan peacebuilding efforts advance and state institutions start functioning.\n\nThe complexity of the electoral system in the new Afghan state is very prominent. There is a presidential election every five years; there is an election every five years for the Lower House members (250 members) who are selected by voting in each province; there are also several elections for selecting the members in the Upper House (100 members), as a third of the members in the Upper House are selected by the Provincial Councils in each province, a third of the members in the Upper House are selected by the District Councils in each district, and a third of the members are selected by the president.\n\nIn 2005, although there were elections for the Lower House members and elections for Provincial Councils in every province, the District Council elections could not be conducted because it was too difficult to line the border of more than 350 districts across Afghanistan. (As a result, two-thirds of the members in the Lower House were selected by the Provincial Councils.) Afghanistan will face election years beginning in 2009. According to the current constitution, it will have a presidential election in 2009 and parliament elections in 2010 in which Afghans need to conduct various types of elections, such as choosing the Lower House members, choosing the Provincial Council members, choosing the District Council members, choosing 34 Upper House members from each Provincial Council all over the country, and choosing the other 34 Upper House members from numerous District Councils across the country. One international official in charge of elections lamented, \"Who made this electoral system? It created too much burden for both Afghans and international organizations and became a big impediment for constructing state institutions.\" 142\n\nThe research identified that in the process of creating the new Afghan constitution, which defines the basic structure of the Afghan electoral system, the members of the Afghan constitutional committee did not seriously consider the complexity of Afghan elections.\n\nThe members thought that \"the more elections they have, the more legitimacy the Afghan government will gain.\" 143 According to an official who was involved in the whole process of creating the constitution, the constitutional committee members did not have serious discussion about the consequences of having a very complex electoral system in a state that was devastated by 23 years' conflicts.\n\nThere was one draft of the constitution in which there was no Upper House in Parliament. In retrospect, it would have been much better to have one presidential election and one election for one parliament; it would substantially reduce the burden of conducting elections as well as simplify legislative processes. But this draft was dropped from the discussion in the committee, and the current electoral system was adopted by the new constitution. This experience suggests that international peacebuilders, mainly the UN who is in charge of assisting the electoral process in the initial stage of peacebuilding, need to assist local authorities to seriously consider the cost and burden of 142 Author's interview with a UN official covering elections, with a condition of anonymity, in 2008. 143 Author's interview with an official who was involved in the discussion of constitutional committee, with a condition of anonymity, in 2008.\n\nconducting elections, as well as to give them the best advice about a new electoral system that is simple and straightforward but enables them to have functioning elections and institutions. As the initial costs of elections are frequently covered by the international community, the international actors must have the right to be substantially involved in making a good electoral system.\n\nAlthough deploying the UN peacekeepers in Afghanistan has not ever been seriously discussed, theoretically it was possible for the UN peacekeepers to play a major role in maintaining security in Afghanistan, especially in the aftermath of the 2002 collapse of the Taliban. The role of the UN in terms of maintaining security in post-conflict situations must be one of the most controversial-and important-issues, especially in its implication for other peacebuilding efforts in the world.\n\nOn the one hand, there is a strong conviction among European and U.S. military circles that they should never put their major force under the command of the UN because the UN is not efficient and reliable in commanding forces. In their view, it is important for NATO to be mandated by the UN Security Council but not commanded by the UN. Maurits Jochems, the ambassador and senior civil representative of NATO in Afghanistan, told me that \"it would be better to answer this particular question as Dutch ambassador, not as ambassador to ISAF. For Dutch MoD (Ministry of Defense), and it is the same for American MoD, British MoD, and quite a few other serious military players, there is no way that they will put their major forces into the command of the UN. Why?, because the UN militarily is not efficient and reliable.\" 144 Because of the UN records in the past, especially in the genocide in Srebrenica in Bosnia, the Dutch Ministry of Defense will never again allow the UN military to lead, he said. 145 He of course added that the traditional UN peacekeeping with the mandate of the UN Chapter VI is fine to be commanded by the UN, as it is to monitor peace in the borders with consent, as was shown in places such as Cyprus or Ethiopia. But as for the operations with the Chapter VII mandate, \"Yes, it should be mandated by the UN Security Council, but we do operations by ourselves because we have more efficient military command.\" 146 One military officer in charge of ISAF in Afghanistan also argued that \"because the UN record in commanding forces is very bad and poor, as shown in Bosnia or Rwanda, if the UN took the command in Afghanistan, the Americans would withdraw. In short, it is not realistic for the UN to have military command in this scale of battle area.\" 147 Asked about why there are several big-scale UN peacekeeping operations in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo or Sudan, he claimed, \"Maybe it is because NATO is not ready to commit their own forces to those peacebuilding operations in Africa.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there is growing frustration and concern by some UN officials and aid workers in donor agencies that several different pillars of command systems by international actors in Afghanistan are causing many problems. One critical problem is the matter of coordination.\n\nOne 144 Author's interview with Maurits Jochems, Ambassador and NATO Senior Civilian Representative, on 19 June 2008. 145 Ibid. 146 Ibid. 147 Author' interview with an international military officer in charge of ISAF, with a condition of anonymity, in 2008. 52 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan aid worker belonging to a major donor agency operating in Afghanistan stressed that \"Because there are many different command pillars, such as ISAF, American Counterterrorism Operations (Operation for Enduring Freedom: OEF), the UN, and the Afghan government, it is too difficult to pursue one objective in Afghanistan.\" 148 One Afghan UNAMA staff lamented, \"Our mandate is too weak to advance some critical political programs, including reconciliation. If I had a few hundred UN peacekeepers, it would be possible for us to dispatch some peacekeepers in borders between tribes, stop conflicts, and establish some peace accords between tribes. But we do not have any force and police that other UN missions have in different post-conflict situations; thus, what we can do is very limited.\" 149 As there is basically no way for the UN to influence the military operation by ISAF and OEF, \"it is also very challenging for UNAMA to advance political programs and keep the trust of people, especially if international forces cause civilian causalities by their operations.\" 150 The other issue is the matter of legitimacy. According to my own opinion survey, 70% in Kandahar, 98% in Wardak, and 98% in Kapisa answered that the United Nations should play a central role in commanding foreign military operations, while 28% in Kandhar, 2% in Wardak, and 2% in Kapisa answered that it should be commanded by the U.S. or NATO (Appendix 1, Q. 13). The major reasons are Afghan people perceive that the UN is more neutral and credible because the UN is not representing the interest of individual foreign 148 Author's interview with an official belonging to one of major aid agencies operating assistance program in Afghanistan, with a condition of anonymity, in 2008. 149 Author's interview with one Afghan UNAMA staff, with a condition of anonymity, in 2008. 150 Ibid.\n\nstates (Appendix 1, Q. 15). When the UN has the substantial advantage of the acceptance of local people in specific regions, the UN peacekeepers, that hopefully include forces who share the culture or religion of people in host states, might be more effective in cooperating with local authorities and people.\n\nWhen discussing this issue, it may be important to recognize that the mission of peacebuilding might be substantially different from the mission of peace enforcement operations. It is true that peace enforcement operations-international intervention to stop the conflicts and stabilize the situation in combat zones-have often been conducted by multinational forces authorized by international organizations, as it requires substantial military combat operations. 151 But as for peacebuilding operations, which need to stay much longer in host states and to implement numerous political and sensitive programs, it might be more effective for the UN to play a central role even in maintaining security because the Special Representative of the Secretary-General could command both military operations and political programs, pursuing unified objectives and goals.\n\nThe role of the UN in commanding international forces should be one of the critical issues to be discussed for future peacebuilding activity and its legitimacy construction. However, it seems unrealistic for Afghanistan to have UN peacekeepers any time soon. With regard to current Afghan peacebuilding, it should be crucial to ensure that UNAMA plays a substantial role in coordinating military operations and political programs, as it is mandated by a UN Security Council resolution. 53 CIR Working Paper No. 47\n\nAlthough it may be too early to draw general conclusions from one case study, two general principles could be addressed from the research in Afghanistan on the construction of domestic legitimacy in the process of peacebuilding assisted by international actors.\n\n(1) Political processes and programs need to be monitored, implemented, and even supervised by international organizations, especially by the UN. Depending too much on local ownership without effective supervision is often counter-effective with regard to political programs. It is not because of the lack of capabilities of local people in host states, but because of the nature of post-conflict nation building: A credible third party needs to play a role in ensuring an impartial peace process and guaranteeing that the political rights of various factions are protected when they comply with elections or disarmament.\n\nIt is notable that the UN has very high trust and credibility in Afghanistan. With regard to the next election in Afghanistan, 70 % in Kandahar, 80% in Wardak, and 94% in Kapisa answered that Afghan authority and the UN should mainly conduct the election (Appendix 1, Q. 29). Many local citizens argued that the presence of the UN can increase the credibility and fairness of the election. This credibility of the UN might enable the UN to play a crucial role in other political programs, such as disarmament and reconciliation.\n\n(2) Economic projects must be seen as government programs as much as possible. In other words, economic and social improvements should be seen as results of government efforts so that the improvements in people's daily lives can increase the legitimacy of the domestic government. In return, the international actors should be allowed to monitor government projects to prevent corruption.\n\nAt the initial stage of peacebuilding, though, it must be inevitable and recommended to have direct investment by international actors for quick impacts on improving the living conditions of local people in the host state; however, it is critical for international actors to start simultaneously designing assistance projects that respect local ownership, such as involvement and participation of local people in both identifying and implementing projects.\n\nThe key is to have a smooth transit from the \"more direct investment by international actors\" to the \"assistance programs conducted through the local government and people.\"\n\nIn addition to the specific policy recommendations, I propose the creation of a new officer who is specifically responsible for understanding the perception and ideas of both domestic peacebuilders (such as domestic officials of interim authorities or local governments) and ordinary people in the future UN peacebuilding operations.\n\nIt should be critical to assess needs, perceptions, and hopes of local people about the policies of both domestic governments and international actors in the different stages of peacebuilding. In collaboration with the staff of UN missions and other NGOs, the operation cost for assessing perceptions of local people is not so expensive (such as this research), but very critical in finding effective policies to construct the legitimacy of the new government.\n\nIt may be difficult to conduct systematic and statistically very rigid surveys in post-conflict situations, but it is still very important, I am convinced, to make best efforts to keep\n\n58 Challenge of Constructing Legitimacy in Peacebuilding: Afghanistan 3.
