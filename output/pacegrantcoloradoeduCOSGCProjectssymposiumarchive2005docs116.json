    "full_text": "Ion and plasma thrusters are currently being used as propulsion devices on both commercial satellites and space research vehicles developed by NASA, JAXA, and ESA; such as the Deep Space One 1 , SMART-1 2 , and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory proposed JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter) 3 spacecraft. Recently an ion thruster has been demonstrated to last over 30,000 hours in a ground-based test 4 . Although the life times of these thrusters are adequate for missions of short-term interest, more ambitious future missions will require more than three times these lifetimes and much higher power levels. To reach these future lifetime requirements, the wear processes around components within high power ion and plasma thrusters must be better understood.\n\nTwo critical components are the hollow cathodes used to drive plasma production and neutralization in both ion and plasma engines and the acceleration channel in plasma thrusters. The plasma properties within and nearby these components affect their lifetime more than any other factor. A key tool needed to characterize these intense plasma environments is a fast moving Langmuir probe system. The development of a Rapidly Actuating Probe for Ion Diagnostics (RAPID) that is being designed to characterize the plasmas produced within ion and plasma thrusters for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base is described. The probe will move at an average speed of 1 m/s into the intense plasma region of an ion or plasma thruster, which is about 2 cm in diameter.\n\nSystem vibration characterization performed using accelerometers will be summarized in section III. The probe must be moved through the plasma plume fast enough so that the probe temperature will not exceed about 1500 K where it would become emissive and corrupt the data. A summary of the heat transfer model used to describe the probe temperature as a function of time and plasma conditions is presented in section IV. The model is used to define the probe bias waveform that will ensure that the probe tip remains below the 1500 K limit. The heat transfer model requires that the voltage to the probe must be swept quickly under the constraint that the waveform sweep not be so fast that the data is unclear or unusable. This constraint requires the use of high-bandwidth power supplies, high-speed data acquisition equipment, and advanced signal processing equipment. Section V describes details of the final configuration of the data acquisition system. Finally, a discussion is provided of probe fabrication techniques that will ensure minimal plasma perturbation in section VI.\n\nA Langmuir probe is used to characterize the properties of a plasma. These properties are electron temperature, electron current, floating potential and plasma potential. The way a Langmuir probe obtains these properties is through a series of probe current data points taken while the probe is biased at different voltages. An idealized plot of probe current vs. probe voltage is shown in Fig. 1. The figure shows the voltage vs. current plot and where the various plasma properties are obtained.\n\nIf the probe sensor gets too hot, it will start to emit electrons and the associated current will corrupt the data. Further, electron temperatures and plasma densities in the intense plasma regions of thrusters will melt a conventional stationary probe if it is biased to high positive potentials for too long. The RAPID system desires to overcome this problem by moving through the plasma at high speeds while simultaneously sweeping the probe bias voltage and measuring the probe voltage and current. This will prevent the probe from exceeding critical temperatures and allow many data points to be taken over a range of linear positions.\n\nFigure 2 shows the prototype system. Its top average speed is approximately 1.1 m/s and its travel length is 23 cm. The probe sensor is a 0.013 cm diameter tungsten wire that protrudes from an alumina insulator.\n\nThe initial design of the probe mount left the probe cantilevered out about 23 cm from its mount. It is undesirable for the probe to vibrate while it is traveling. To reduce the length of the cantilever, a proposed support was to be placed at the edge of the discharge chamber of the thruster. The probe would pass through the support as it traveled, thus reducing the length of the cantilever.\n\nThe concern with the support, as shown through analysis, was that the length and therefore the natural frequency would change with the travel length. If the probe was driven at its natural frequency at any time during travel, vibrations would be excited and completely defeat the purpose of the support.\n\nThe natural frequencies of the probe and test rod were ascertained though calculations and finite element analysis. These calculations were made using the assumption that the probe has multiple cross-sections. It is a hollow cylinder with an outer diameter of 2.39 mm and an inner diameter of 1.60 mm that is 18 cm long. A smaller tube (1.27 mm O.D., 0.51 mm I.D.) is inserted into the larger tube at one end. A 0.013 cm wire is inserted through both tubes and will protrude out of the small tube end by 0.013 cm. Calculations were also done for a 0.953 cm steel rod that was used to simulate the probe during mechanical testing.  4 show the natural frequencies of the probe and the test rod plotted against length. Comparison of these figures shows that the natural frequency plot for the probe is very close to that of the steel test rod.\n\nTests were conducted to determine whether the support would decrease the amount of vibration of the probe. The prototype linear ball screw system (Fig. 2) was used to perform the test. A 0.95 cm diameter, 45.7 cm long, stainless steel rod was mounted to the carriage. The rod was held in place by two aluminum blocks with holes through them. The blocks were separated by 6.35 cm of empty space through which the rod was suspended. The hole through the rear block was threaded, as was the rod, to secure it. The end of the rod protruded through the rear block and was fastened using a jam nut. The front block was drilled to a small tolerance (0.0051 cm) larger than the rod. This tolerance kept the rod from moving after the blocks were bolted down onto the carriage.\n\nThe rod was then inserted into a stationary support. The support consisted of four standoffs supporting an aluminum plate as seen in Fig. 5. An aluminum block with a hole drilled axially through it was bolted on top of the plate. Two linear bearings were inserted into the hole and secured using setscrews. The rod was then passed through the bearings. At full extension the rod was 23 cm long. When retracted, the rod protruded 1.9 cm from the block.\n\nThe next step was to attach the accelerometers to the rod and the frame. Three accelerometers were used. One was placed on the base of the lead-screw frame, another was placed on the carriage and the third was placed on the tip of the rod (circled in Fig. 6). A 2.5 cm square piece of steel was fastened to the end of the rod using epoxy. The accelerometer was then placed on the end of the rod using a magnet.\n\nSeveral tests were then conducted. The first test consisted of running the lead-screw at an average of 0.1 m/s. The second test was at 0.5 m/s. The next tests were run at different drive screw accelerations and an average speed of about 1.1 m/s. A bump test was also conducted to determine the natural frequency of the rod. This test was The total distance of travel was 21 cm at a maximum average speed of 1.1 m/s. The data were taken at 12,000 samples per second. The accelerometer signal output of 100 mV corresponds to 1 g of acceleration. To get displacement, the acceleration was numerically integrated twice.\n\nThe data from MathCAD calculations, a Pro/E modal analysis, and the test data are compared in Fig. 7. The MathCAD and the Pro/E analysis slightly overestimate integrated accelerometer data.\n\nAs Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show, the vibration of the rod as it is moved through its travel is very small (on the order of 10 -4 mm). The unsupported case results (Fig. 8) show probe vibration amplitudes that are about half those for the supported case (Fig. 9). It can also be seen that the frequency of vibration of the supported case is changing as the length of the probe changes. Conversely, the unsupported case vibrates at the same frequency all through the travel.\n\nThe results of the test show that the support does not decrease the amount of vibration in the probe; in fact, the vibration is slightly amplified. This amplified vibration could be caused by misalignment in the bearings. It could also be occurring because the bearings are not rolling as smoothly as they were intended to. Because the low vibration levels it was decided that no support will be used in the final design.\n\nAnother test was conducted to determine whether or not the probe would hit within a desired 0.025 cm target diameter repeatedly at the end of travel. A 0.13 cm diameter test probe was attached to the end of the stainless steel test rod (Fig. 10). The probe was then manually inserted into a piece of foil that was mounted at the end of the probe's travel. The probe was then run through its full travel (21 cm) at 1.1 m/s average speed 10 times. After the 10 th run, the hole in the foil was inspected by inserting the probe into it manually again. The hole in the foil had not increased in size, thereby showing that the probe was repeatedly hitting the same spot. Figure 9. Unsupported case test results\n\nThe probe was to be maintained at a temperature of less than 1300 K. Keeping the temperature below 1300 K will serve two purposes. First, it ensures that the probe will not melt; the melting temperature for tungsten is approximately 3700 K. And second, the probe will start to emit electrons at temperatures above 1500 K, which will corrupt the data. A radiation model was developed for predicting the amount of time that the probe could be left in the plasma before it reached 1300 K. This model assumes an electron density of 10 13 cm -3 , an electron temperature of 6.5 eV, and plasma potential of 30 V.\n\nThe probe will only be collecting relevant data while the triangular bias voltage signal is ramping up, however, the probe will be heating up during all of the travel due to a high rate of power deposition from the radiating plasma. The probe will heat up because of the radiation from the nearby components, electrons collected on the probe, and ohmic heating due to the current flowing through the probe.\n\nA thermocouple was set up in a configuration very similar to the Langmuir probe that will be used in the future. The thermocouple was placed in a vacuum chamber near a plasma source, just as the Langmuir probe would normally be set up. The model predicted that the probe would reach a max temperature of 650 K. This is well below the specified peak temperature of 1300 K. Experimental results obtained with the thermocouple are observed to be in good agreement with the model, as Fig. 11 shows.\n\nA model for probe cooling was also developed using radiation as the only heat transfer method. The goal of this model was to determine how long the probe needed to be removed from the plasma in order for it to cool down to approximately 300 K. The probe will need to be cooled so that the temperature will not compound during multiple insertions into the plasma and, as a result, exceed 1300 K. The cooling model showed that the probe will cool down to approximately 300 K after a little more than 3 minutes (Fig. 12) from temperatures between 500 K and 1500 K. The probe does not actually need to reach exactly 300K and the data of Fig. 12 show it should cool down into the 350 K or 400 K in about 30 seconds to 1 Figure 13 shows an experimental validation of the cooling model. Eventually, it is desired that the probe be able to take many data sets in a short amount of time. This would involve moving the probe into the plasma at many different distances from the cathode. A cooling time of 1 or 2 minutes at most makes this an achievable goal. Both the heating and the cooling models can be adjusted to predict results with different parameters, such as electron temperature, plasma density, and plasma potential.\n\nThe real-time sub-system consists of data acquisition and motion control. The data acquisition involved biasing the probe between 15 V and -50 V in a triangular waveform, as well as recording this waveform and the voltage drop across a resistor to measure the probe current. The motion control required using a motor and motor controller, as well as a retractable fishline position sensor. The position sensor used an internal potentiometer with a voltage applied across it to yield a position measurement.\n\nThe data acquisition hardware had to be capable of recording data at high speeds accommodate probe movement at an average velocity of 1 m/s. The desired speed of collection was 50 data points every 0.01 milliseconds. This corresponds to a sampling rate of 5MS/s (megasamples per second). The hardware capable of this data collection rate is a National Instruments PXI S-series, 14-bit data acquisition card. The S -series allowed for simultaneous sampling through each of its eight analog channels.\n\nInitially the data were collected using an oscilloscope connected to a PC using a GPIB DAQ card. The problem with the oscilloscope is that its largest sampling capacity is 8000 points. With a desired sampling rate of 5 MS/s and an average speed of 1 m/s over 21 cm, approximately 1 million data points will be collected. Hence, the data storage capacity of the oscilloscope was severely limiting and the PXI based system was selected to overcome this problem.\n\nThe waveform used to generate the current vs. voltage plot was initially created using an HP function generator. Because the PXI system was available, the waveform was also created using an M-series, 16-bit card from National Instruments. The desired frequency of the waveform is 10 kHz. The M-series card's signal is amplified to ±50 V. This range will be sufficient to obtain the Langmuir probe trace. Figure 14 shows the waveform. The whole wave is applied such that a measurement is taken over 0.01 mm every 0.1 mm of probe travel. Taking a trace every 0.1 mm should give an accurate picture of the entire dense plasma region of interest.\n\nThe motion of the ball screw was created by a stepper motor. This motion was controlled by a Compumotor motion controller. It was connected to the PXI system through a serial cable and programmed to control distance traveled, velocity and acceleration. LabVIEW was used to program all the controls used for the probe system.\n\nOne problem with the probes currently in use is the fact that they perturb the plasma either do their physical presence or by emitting electrons from the probe. This effect causes the data collected to be different from what it should be. One method that has been proposed to minimize the effect of the probe insertion is segmenting the probe with bands of a conductive material. This will electrically grade each section of the probe so that the plasma is tricked into thinking the probe is not present 5 .\n\nThe segmentation can be accomplished by using a sputter deposition process. This process involves running an ion source in a vacuum chamber while it is pointed at a target. In this case, a stainless steel target was used to coat the probe insulator. The ions from the ion source bombard the target, knocking atoms loose, causing them to stream away from the target. In order to obtain the rings for segmentation, a masking apparatus was constructed. This rotating apparatus is shown in Fig. 15. Figure 16 shows the masking plate, plate holder and probe holder disassembled. The insulator was rotated at a constant rate to obtain an even coating around its circumference. The probe insulator after it had been coated can be seen in Fig. 17.\n\nThe segmented insulator will be tested with the probe system and compared to a non-segmented, alumina probe. The test will determine whether or not the effect of the plasma perturbation is significant, as it is thought to be. Figure 16. Masking apparatus exploded view Figure 15. Masking apparatus\n\nA rapidly actuating plasma diagnostic tool has been designed and fabricated. Testing has shown that the vibration of the probe will not be excessive. The temperature of the probe will remain below critical temperatures if the recommended cooling times are maintained. These factors show that the probe system is ready for testing. The probe will be set up in a vacuum chamber with an ion thruster and probe current vs. voltage plots will be obtained. These plots will be compared to other plots that have been taken with stationary probe to validate the experiments."
