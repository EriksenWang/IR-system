    "abstract": "High-resolution seismic imaging and piston coring in Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, have revealed surprising deformation structures in flat-lying, unconsolidated sediment at the foot of subaqueous slopes. These deformation structures appear beneath wedges of massflow deposits and resemble fold-andthrust belts with basal de ´collement surfaces. The deformation is interpreted as the result of gravity spreading induced by loading of the slope-adjacent lake floor during massflow deposition. This study investigated four earthquaketriggered lateral mass-movement deposits in Lake Lucerne affecting four sections of the lake floor with areas ranging from 0AE25 to 6AE5 km 2 in area. Up to 6 m thick sediment packages draping the subaqueous slopes slid along the acoustic basement. The resulting failure scars typically lie in water depths of >30 m on slopes characterized by downward steepening and inclinations of >10°. From the base-of-slope to several hundred metres out onto the flat plains, the wedges of massflow deposits overlie deeply (10-20 m) deformed basinplain sediment characterized by soft sediment fold-and-thrust belts with arcuate strikes and pronounced frontal thrusts. The intensity of deformation decreases towards the more external parts of the massflow wedges. Beyond the frontal thrust, the overridden lake floor remains mostly undisturbed. Geometrical relationships between massflow deposits and the deformed basin-plain sediment indicate that deformation occurred mainly during massflow deposition. Gravity spreading induced by the successive collapse of the growing slope-adjacent massflow wedge is proposed as the driving mechanism for the deformation. The geometry of fjord-type lakes with sharp lower slope breaks favours the deposition of thick, basin-marginal massflow wedges, that effectively load and deform the underlying sediment. In the centre of the basins, the two largest massflow deposits described are directly overlain by thick contained (mega-)turbidites, interpreted as combined products of the suspension clouds set up by subaqueous mass movements and related tsunami and seiche waves.",
    "full_text": "Mass movements are common features in marine and lacustrine systems. They represent significant sediment accumulation processes and can be a considerable hazard in offshore and near-shore environments. Large research efforts in recent years have substantially increased our knowledge of large-and medium-scale submarine slope instabilities (Locat & Lee, 2000). Numerous examples of submarine landslides have been documented, most of them along open continental slopes (e.g. Kenyon, 1987;Piper et al., 1999;Imbo et al., 2003), in submarine canyons (e.g. Carlson & Karl, 1988) and river deltas (e.g. Prior & Coleman, 1978). In fjords and fjord-type lakes, the studies have mainly concentrated on headwall deltas (Prior et al., 1984;Shilts & Clague, 1992) and side-entry deltas (Terzaghi, 1956;Prior et al., 1981). Although the steep lateral non-delta slopes of perialpine lakes and fjords are often covered with sedimentary drapes that are susceptible to sliding, corresponding mass movements have only been briefly mentioned in the literature (e.g. Giovanoli et al., 1984;Chapron et al., 1996;Syvitski & Schafer, 1996;Eyles et al., 2000) and detailed case studies (e.g. Kelts, 1978;Kelts & Hsu ¨, 1980) are rare.\n\nSharp breaks between steep lateral slopes and intervening flat lake basin floors are peculiar characteristics of perialpine lakes and fjords. This geometry strongly influences the flow behaviour and depositional characteristics of lateral mass movements (Komar, 1971;Kelts & Hsu ¨, 1980;Nemec, 1990) and favours compression and deformation of the flat-lying, lake-floor sediments through the impact and load of the descending masses (Syvitski & Schafer, 1996). Although such deformation can be extensive, the processes involved are poorly understood.\n\nIn this study, redepositional processes in lakes are linked to the sedimentary features observed in the resultant deposits. The characteristics of four lateral slides, of different scale, in Lake Lucerne, Central Switzerland (Fig. 1A), are described. The architecture of the failure scars, mass-movement deposits and deformed basin-plain sediments were imaged by means of high-resolution seismic reflection profiling and evaluated with piston coring. Based on these observations, the slide history and the processes governing the massmovement evolution are reconstructed. In particular, special attention is given to the deformation of basin-plain sediment by the loading of the basin floor by descending masses.\n\nThe mass-movement terminology used in this paper is based on the seismic signature of the sediments. Failure scars, slide deposits, massflow deposits and large turbidites are typical massmovement features that can be recognized on seismic sections.

(C) Bathymetry of the three studied basins as derived from the seismic data. Contour interval is 10 and 5 m for solid and dotted lines respectively. The bold dotted line indicates a major subaqueous sill. Slide complexes discussed in this paper are marked with grey shadings, whereby dark and light grey indicate dominant erosional and depositional zones respectively. during descent, a mass movement generally transforms from a coherent slide block with a distinct sliding plain into a massflow and finally into a turbidity current (e.g. Mulder & Cochonat, 1996 and references therein). Consequently, a single mass-movement event usually produces more than one type of deposit.\n\nSlides leave distinct failure scars and gliding planes on the subaqueous slopes. Slide deposits show contorted or faulted, but essentially continuous reflections on seismic sections because the internal structure of the redeposited material remains largely undisturbed and displacement is limited (Nardin et al., 1979;Mulder & Cochonat, 1996). In this study, the term slide is not only used for the initial, up-dip phase of a mass movement, but also to name the entire 'slideflow-turbidite complex' (e.g. 'Vitznau Slide').\n\nMassflow deposits generally occur at the toe of slopes and build up sediment wedges with a chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies, irregular lower surfaces that crosscut stratigraphy, slightly hummocky to fairly smooth upper surfaces and distinct distal terminations (e.g. Prior et al., 1984). Such characteristics indicate a lack of large coherent blocks reflecting a higher degree of remoulding and disintegration of massflow compared with slide deposits.\n\nTurbidites related to massflows generally appear as confined bodies in the deepest part of the basins and show an almost transparent seismic facies with smooth upper surfaces. These bodies often directly overlay the massflow deposits to which they relate. The transparent seismic facies of such turbidites is the result of their relatively homogeneous nature. Compared with flood-related turbidites, turbidites related to medium to large massflows are generally thicker with much larger volumes. Besides the sediment brought into suspension directly from the massflow, such turbidites often include material lofted by tsunamis or seiches. As a consequence of their complex and diverse evolution, such deposits have been named 'seismoturbidite' (Nakajima & Kanai, 2000), 'seiche deposits' (Siegenthaler et al., 1987;Van Rensbergen et al., 1999), 'homogenite' (Kastens & Cita, 1981;Siegenthaler et al., 1987;Chapron et al., 1999) and 'megaturbidite' (Bouma, 1987). As the described turbidite bodies are usually a coalescing product of different processes, the purely process-oriented names 'seismoturbidite' and 'seiche deposits' are avoided here. In addition, the term 'homogenite' is inappropriate as the relevant beds in Lake Lucerne are not completely homogeneous but typically show a graded base. Consequently, the widely accepted and more general term 'megaturbidite' (Bouma, 1987) is used. Note that the term 'mega-' refers to the unusual size of the turbidites compared with other, mostly flood-generated turbidites in the same setting. Consequently, megaturbidites in a lake are relatively small compared with their oceanic counterparts.\n\nSelected basins of Lake Lucerne were surveyed using a high-resolution, single-channel seismic system with a centre frequency of 3AE5 kHz (pinger source). The source/receiver was mounted on a cataraft that was pushed by a vessel. Differential GPS provided a horizontal positional accuracy of ±2 m. The studied basins were covered with a dense grid of more than 300 km of seismic lines revealing a quasi-3D image of the subsurface.\n\nData processing was carried out with SPW TM software (Parallel Geoscience Corp., Incline Village, NV, USA) and included band pass filtering, automatic gain control, spiking deconvolution and muting of the noise in the water column. No migration was applied to the data. Water depths were calculated assuming a velocity of 1500 m sec )1 . The bathymetric maps shown in this paper are based on the seismic data.\n\nSediment cores were retrieved using a Kullenberg-type piston corer (Kelts et al., 1986). Gamma-ray attenuation bulk density, magnetic susceptibility and P-wave velocity were measured on whole-round cores with a GEOTEK TM (GEOTEK Ltd, Daventry, UK) multisensor core logger. Subsequently, the cores were split, photographed and described macroscopically. Coreto-core correlation was achieved by comparing both visual characteristics and petrophysical properties. Bulk density and P-wave velocity profiles enabled an accurate seismic-to-core correlation.\n\nLake Lucerne is a perialpine lake of glacial origin situated in Central Switzerland. It has a total surface area of 116 km 2 and consists of seven steep-sided basins with flat bottoms (Fig. 1A). Four major alpine rivers feed the internal four basins providing approximately 80% of the lake's water supply. This study concentrates on the three external basins (the Chru ¨ztrichter, Vitznau and Ku ¨ssnacht basins) that are separated from the major deltas by subaqueous sills. All of the slides Mass movement-induced deformation structures 273 discussed are located north of the alpine front, in areas with a molassic substratum mainly consisting of sandstones and conglomerates.\n\nIn the central part of the Vitznau Basin the bedrock is covered with a 117 m thick glaciolacustrine infill (Finckh et al., 1984). Seismic stratigraphy calibrated with piston coring and radiocarbon dating indicates that most of these sediments were deposited during the Late Glacial period and only the uppermost 5-15 m are of Holocene age (Schnellmann, 2004). Whereas Late Glacial sedimentation was focused in topographic depressions, the Holocene sediments are more widely and regularly distributed and also drape the sub-lacustrine slopes. Similar observations in other perialpine lakes have been interpreted as reflecting a major change in the sedimentary system. Whereas in Late Glacial times most of the sediment was deposited on deltas and in the deep basins by underflows, the increasing importance of interflows and authigenic production during the Holocene led to a more regularly distributed sedimentation with increased accumulation of fine grained sediment even on relatively steep marginal slopes (Sturm & Matter, 1978;Mullins et al., 1991;Van Rensbergen et al., 1999;Eyles et al., 2000;Beck et al., 2001).\n\nPiston cores from areas with rather condensed Holocene sedimentary sequences reached the uppermost 1-5 m of the Late Glacial basin fill (cores 4WS00-4P, 4WS00-8P, 4WS02-1, 4WS02-2 in Fig. 1B; Schnellmann, 2004). These deposits comprise grey to yellowish mud with a very fine, most probably annual lamination (glacial varves) and frequent intercalated graded beds of brown, grey and beige colour (turbidites). The Holocene sediments consist of faintly laminated, grey to brown mud with dark layers rich in organic matter (mainly leaves and debris of land plants) and some intercalated, mm-to few cm-thick graded layers of beige, brown or grey (turbidites).\n\nNumerous failure scars, massflow deposits and megaturbidites can be recognized on seismic sections through the studied lake basins. The massflow deposits observed range in thickness from <1 to >10 m and occur either at the foot of subaqueous slopes with inclinations >10°or in front of rockfall cones. Systematic seismic-stratigraphic mapping and correlation of the massflow deposits identified in the study area shows that the majority of these deposits are no single incidents, but belong to, most probably earthquake-triggered, multiple events (Schnellmann et al., 2002;Schnellmann, 2004).\n\nIn the following, the detailed characteristics of subaqueous mass-movement deposits in Lake Lucerne are pointed out based on four case studies of different scale. The first three examples described (Chru ¨ztrichter, Zinnen and Weggis slides; Fig. 1C) are part of a multiple-slide event triggered by the historically well-documented 1601 AD, magnitude 6AE2 earthquake (Fa ¨h et al., 2003;Schwarz-Zanetti et al., 2003). The last case study (St Niklausen Slide; Fig. 1C) belongs to a prehistoric earthquake-triggered multiple-slide event 14 C-dated to 2420 cal yr BP (Schnellmann et al., 2002).\n\nThe relatively small Chru ¨ztrichter Slide is located on the north-western edge of the Chru ¨ztrichter Basin and affects an area of 0AE3 km 2 from failure scar to toe of deposits (Figs 1C and 2). The failure scar lies on a 10-15°steep, northward-dipping slope of a small subaqueous mound at 30-40 m water depth. It cuts a 5-6 m thick, acoustically laminated sedimentary drape that overlies acoustic basement in the undisturbed slope environ- A ment above and lateral to the failure scar (Fig. 3). The absence of the entire drape points towards a translational slide with the acoustic basement acting as the failure surface.\n\nThe pathway of the slide and the massflow it transformed to is marked by a counterclockwise rotation from a northward to a south-westwarddirected movement, following the steepest topographic gradient (Fig. 2). At its central part, the pathway narrows as a result of basement-controlled bathymetric constriction, and a 150 m wide trench is cut into acoustically laminated lake sediments, most probably as a result of increased flow velocities in this bottleneck area (Fig. 4; Gee et al., 2001). The erosive trench is partly filled with massflow deposits imaged on the seismic section by a package of chaoticto-transparent seismic facies with a flat, rather smooth upper surface. The acoustically chaoticto-transparent deposits forming a tiny bulge above the north-western rim of the trench are interpreted as the result of material overflowing the trench margins during passage of the massflow.\n\nA positive relief feature at the mouth of the trench indicates a depositional lobe at the edge of the basin plain (Fig. 2). Figure 5A shows a longitudinal line, whereas Fig. 5B and C shows two slightly oblique cross-sections through the frontal part of this lobe. Continuous reflections indicate undisturbed sedimentary layering in the lowermost part of these profiles. Further above, acoustically laminated sediment packages are deformed and displaced relative to each other and form a soft-sediment fold-and-thrust belt. Deformation is concentrated in distinct shear zones between undisturbed sediment blocks. Comparison of the seismic reflection patterns of different, acoustically layered packages reveals reverse faults with vertical offsets of up to 3 m. Duplicated sedimentary units indicate major thrusting. A profile trending perpendicular to the main axis of the deposits shows thrust systems verging in opposite directions, a phenomenon that is obviously related to the semicircular deformation front (Figs 2 and 5B). This curvilinear nature of the deformation front indicates that radial forces induced the deformation. The thrust front is expressed by a blind thrust that  detaches at 12 m sediment depth (Fig. 5C). Towards the more internal, northern part of the deformed zone, acoustically layered blocks become smaller and less frequent and the seismic facies grades into a chaotic-to-transparent type. In this northern zone, deformation and remoulding of the sediment seem to be more intense and, as a result, the remaining undisturbed sediment blocks become too small to be imaged by the limited horizontal resolution of the seismic system (Fig. 5A).\n\nThe uppermost part of the depositional lobe consists of an up to 2 m thick package of massflow deposits characterized by a chaoticto-transparent seismic facies and distinct frontal and lateral terminations (Fig. 5). The post-massflow cover is less than a few dm thick. However, its exact thickness is difficult to determine because of the strong seismic lake floor signature.\n\nMassflows and/or related water movements often loft suspension clouds and thereby initiate turbidity currents. In the case of the Chru ¨ztrichter Slide, no evidence for a massflow-related turbidite can be seen on seismic sections, despite the existence of a small depression adjacent to the depositional lobe (Fig. 1C), which could potentially trap a turbidity current.\n\nThis small slide (0AE25 km 2 ) is located in the southern part of the Ku ¨ssnacht Basin (Fig. 1C), in an area characterized by a sharp break between the steep slope (15°) and the flat basin plain. An approximately 2 m high failure scar is located at 30-40 m water depth. Beneath the failure scar the acoustic basement is exposed.\n\nA sediment wedge with a primarily chaotic-totransparent acoustic signature is present along the edge of the 73 m deep basin plain (Fig. 6).\n\nClose to the slope break, the chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies extends down to a sediment depth of 8-12 m. Further basinwards, a thin sheet of massflow deposits overlie acoustically layered sediment. A ramp anticline with an associated backthrust, as well as several minor reverse faults, can be seen in the acoustically laminated sediments below the internal part of the thin massflow sheet (Fig. 6). The de ´collement of these deformation structures is located at 8 m sediment depth in an area characterized by high-amplitude reflections. At the lake floor the ramp anticline is expressed by a bulge, indicating folding and thrusting of the overridden basin-plain sediments during and/or just after emplacement of the massflow deposits. The post-event sediments covering the massflow deposits are maximally a few dm thick. Mass movement-induced deformation structures 277 Ó 2005 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 52, 271-289\n\nThe biggest slide in the study area, the Weggis Slide, is located on the northern slope of the Vitznau Basin (Figs 1C and 7) and affects an area of about 6AE5 km 2 . At the time of its discovery, it was interpreted as the subaqueous continuation of a subaerial earthflow (Hsu ¨& Kelts, 1985). This event took place in 1795 AD, lasted 2 weeks and destroyed 33 buildings in the village of Weggis. Later, it was shown that the subaqueous deposits are older than this earthflow event and relate to the 1601 AD, magnitude 6AE2 earthquake (Siegenthaler et al., 1987;Lemcke, 1992).\n\nWhereas the southern slope of the Vitznau Basin consists of a steep rock face, the northern slope is flatter and shows a more irregular bathymetry with two topographic steps and an intermediate terrace (Figs 7 and 8A). The sedimentary infill of the central basin consists mainly of flat-lying, acoustically layered sediment. In contrast, material that was transported or deformed by the slide shows a characteristic chaoticto-transparent acoustic signature (Fig. 8A).\n\nThe failure scar reaches a maximum height of 6 m and extends laterally over more than 6 km in water depths ranging from 40 to 100 m (Fig. 7). In the area of Weggis, the depth of the scar cannot be determined because of the overprint of the 1795 AD earthflow event mentioned above. In Fig. 8A, the failure scar appears at 45 m water depth in a zone where the slope inclination increases downwards from <10°to 15°.\n\nSeismically chaotic-to-transparent zones indicate slide and massflow deposits on a subaqueous terrace and in the basin plain. In the central part of the basin, these deposits are wedge-shaped and overlie acoustically stratified and, therefore, undisturbed basin-plain sediment (Fig. 8B). Towards the northern basin edge, this acoustic stratification ends abruptly and grades into a chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies, indicating deep-reaching deformation of the slope-adjacent basin-plain sediment. Figure 8C shows a close up of this seismic facies boundary, separating disturbed from undisturbed basin-plain sediment. Within the chaotic-to-transparent seismic zone, some packages with intact acoustic layering are present. A comparison of the reflection patterns of these packages reveals a major frontal thrust with a vertical offset of 4-5 m. A second, more internal thrust package is faintly recognizable further to the north. The de ´collement of these structures presumably lies 15-20 m below the lake floor, as the deeper sediments show an undisturbed acoustic layering. Mapping of the deformation front reveals two semicircular structures that project out 600 m into the basin plain (Fig. 7). Concerning the timing of basin-plain deformation, two observations from Fig. 8C are partic-A B C Fig. 8. A 3AE5 kHz seismic line illustrating the structure of the Weggis Slide. (A) Seismic profile showing the morphology of the Vitznau Basin and the acoustic signature of its sedimentary infill. (B) Enlargement of seismic line (A) showing distal massflow wedge and overlying contained megaturbidite. (C) Enlargement of line (A) showing the boundary between deformed and almost undeformed basin-plain sediment. Black lines denote faults, coloured bars mark specific seismic stratigraphic horizons. Note the major frontal thrust with a vertical offset of about 5 m and the overlying slight bulge in topography. The deposits overlying the green seismic stratigraphic horizon (indicated by a vertical black bar) are thicker in the footwall than in the hangingwall, indicating syndepositional thrust emplacement.\n\nularly relevant: (1) the frontal thrust is clearly expressed at the lake floor by a topographic bulge; and (2) the thickness of the sediment overlying the green seismic stratigraphic horizon (vertical black bar in Fig. 8C) is 7 and 3 m in the footwall and the hangingwall respectively. The existence of a topographic bulge related to the frontal thrust shows that the thrusting does not predate the emplacement of the massflow deposits, as otherwise the latter would have levelled out the topography to a high degree. Neither can the thrust be purely 'post-massflow', because then, the thicknesses of the deposits overlying the green seismic-stratigraphic horizon should be the same in the hanging and in the footwall. Consequently, thrusting must essentially have taken place during massflow deposition.\n\nDistally, a wedge of massflow deposits with a chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies and a relatively smooth upper surface overlies almost undisturbed basin-plain sediment showing a continuous acoustic layering (Fig. 8B). The wedge is directly superimposed by an up to 2 m thick, acoustically transparent body that shows a smooth surface and appears focused in the deepest part of the basin levelling out the bathymetry. This sedimentary body is interpreted as massflow-related megaturbidite, based on its seismic facies and geometry, as well as its stratigraphic position directly on top of the massflow deposits. It is covered with a few dm of acoustically layered, post-event sediments.\n\nFigure 9 shows photographs of a piston core through the distal part of the Vitznau basin and includes undisturbed sediments as well as massflow and megaturbidite deposits related to the Vitznau Slide. The undisturbed sediments consist of faintly laminated mud intercalated with black, organic carbon-rich layers and brown to beige, graded turbidite beds (Fig. 9A and E). The massflow-related megaturbidite consists of homogeneous grey mud with a graded, silty to sandy base and a characteristic thin, light-grey clayey cap (Fig. 9A and B). Whereas the uppermost part of the massflow deposits is highly disintegrated and consists of a conglomerate of small mudclasts (Fig. 9C), larger clasts of partly folded strata are abundant further below (Fig. 9D).\n\nAffecting an area of 0AE8 km 2 from failure scar to toe of massflow deposits, the St Niklausen Slide complex is of medium size compared with the case studies presented above. The studied slope is located in the western Chru ¨ztrichter Basin (Figs 1C and 10) and has repeatedly become unstable in Late Glacial and Holocene times, as indicated by stacked massflow deposits on the basin plain (Fig. 11). A 1AE5 km long and up to 6 m high failure scar is located on a downwards steepening slope at 40-50 m water depth (Fig. 11). On a 10-20°steep section of the slope, the acoustic basement is covered only by postevent sediment (Fig. 11).\n\nThe following description will concentrate on the most recent massflow deposit. It was dated at 2420 cal yr BP and is part of a multiple massmovement event described further in Schnellmann et al. (2002). The distal part of the massflow lobe is composed of a thin sheet of sediments with a chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies (Fig. 12A). It overlies almost undisturbed, basinplain sediments characterized by continuous reflections on seismic sections. Closer to the western basin margin slope, these reflections end abruptly and border a 6-8 m thick package of acoustically chaotic-to-transparent sediment. The sharp and steep lateral seismic facies boundary is interpreted as deformation front separating deeply deformed from essentially undeformed basin-plain sediment. A bulge in topography, which directly overlies this deformation front, points towards a major frontal thrust.

Bathymetric map with the outline of the St Niklausen Slide. Contour interval is 5 m. For location of the map segment shown, see Fig. 1B. to previous examples, the seismic facies changes directly from a chaotic-to-transparent type to an acoustically layered type, and a transition zone with displaced, acoustically laminated sediment blocks is absent. Here, internally undisturbed sediment blocks may be too small to be imaged by the seismic system. An acoustically almost transparent body that is restricted to the deepest part of the basin and directly superimposes the massflow deposits, is interpreted as megaturbidite.\n\nIn order to gain insight into the internal sediment structures of the acoustically chaoticto-transparent zone, three 8-10 m long piston cores were retrieved along the axis of the slide complex, through slope-adjacent massflow deposits with deformed substrate, through more distal  The lower part of the slope-adjacent deposits (core 4WS00-3P) is characterized by faintly layered, up to 1AE5 m thick undisturbed sediment blocks that are separated by shear zones consisting of folded and disrupted sediment. Two major overthrusts and associated repeated sediment packages are indicated in Fig. 12B. The highly deformed base of the deformation zone at 9-10 m in core 4WS00-3P presumably represents the main thrust de ´collement. Whereas undisturbed sediment blocks reach thicknesses >1AE5 m in the central part of the deformed zone, the size of these blocks decreases towards the top, where deformation becomes more intense. The uppermost 25 cm of the disturbed zone consists of a mudclast conglomerate indicating extensive remoulding and disintegration of the sediments during transport. This zone is directly overlain by a 12 cm thick megaturbidite consisting of grey to brown silty clays with a graded sandy base and a light-grey clayey cap. The core photograph in Fig. 13 shows the three main types of redeposited and deformed sediment described above: (i) undisturbed sediment blocks separated by deformation zones; (ii) mudclast conglomerate; and (iii) megaturbidite.\n\nIn a more distal position of the massflow lobe, mudclast conglomerates and deformed sediment are restricted to a 0AE5 m thick zone (core 4WS00-2P). Core-to-core correlations show that further below the complete and undisturbed stratigraphic succession is in place. Consequently, the 0AE5 m thick zone is interpreted as the product of a massflow, which neither removed nor deformed substantial parts of the substrate during emplacement.\n\nIn the following section the four studied massmovement complexes are compared. The dynamics of the slides, massflows and related turbidity currents are discussed separately, before the deformation of the basin-plain loaded by slide and massflow is considered.\n\nA major precondition for sliding is the availability of sediment on the slope. As in many perialpine lakes (e.g. Van Rensbergen et al., 1999;Eyles et al., 2000), a primarily Holocene drape covers large parts of Lake Lucerne. No, or very little, sediment accumulation is seen on seismic sections on very steep slopes and cliffs only. In the four examples presented, the whole sedimentary drape slid away as a translational slide (Mulder & Cochonat, 1996) that made a detachment located at the top of the acoustic basement.\n\nThe geometry and position of failure scars contain information about possible triggering mechanisms (Mulder & Cochonat, 1996). As the failure scars of the slides discussed mostly lie in water depths >30 m, surface waves and human activity can be excluded as triggering mechanisms. Moreover, the considerable depth of the scars implies that the slides do not represent the subaqueous continuations of subaerial mass  11 showing the deposits of the most recent slide in the St Niklausen area, 14 C dated at 2420 cal yr BP (Schnellmann et al., 2002). Three different zones can be seen: (i) a slopeadjacent zone characterized by deep reaching, basin-plain deformation; (ii) a central basinal zone with a thin massflow package overlying almost undisturbed basin-plain sediment; and (iii) a distal zone beyond the reach of the massflow with an eastward thinning, contained megaturbidite. (B) Lithology, gamma-ray attenuation bulk density and magnetic susceptibility logs for three piston cores retrieved from these deposits. Data points from section ends were removed in the density and magnetic susceptibility logs because end caps did not allow proper measurement procedure. The location of the cores is denoted in (A) as well as on the map shown in Fig. 10. Seismic-to-core correlation is indicated by five numbered arrows at the right hand side of (A) and (B). The strong reflections in (A) are interpreted as a response of the zones with high-density contrasts outlined by grey bars in (B). The sediment retrieved from the acoustically chaotic-to-transparent zone (core 4WS00-3P) is characterized by up to 2 m thick, undisturbed sediment blocks that are separated by relatively small deformation zones. Repeated sedimentary sections and two major overthrusts are indicated on the left-hand side of the core log by bars (dotted, solid and dashed) and arrows respectively. The identification of these repeated sequences is based on core-to-core correlation and 14 C dating (Schnellmann, 2004). Core-to-core correlation of cores 4WS00-2P and 4WS00-1P indicates that the full stratigraphic succession is present in both these cores. Consequently, the 0AE5 m thick massflow deposits present in core 4WS00-2P must have been deposited without significant erosion or deformation of the underlying basin-plain sediments. movements. This is in agreement with earlier work, which related the Weggis, Chru ¨ztrichter, Zinnen and St Niklausen slides to multiple-slide events triggered by strong historic and prehistoric earthquakes (Schnellmann et al., 2002;Schwarz-Zanetti et al., 2003).\n\nThe failure scars of the described slides are all located on distally steepening slopes (Figs 3B,8A and 11). Such areas are critical because the gravitational shear stress increases and the shear strength (friction) decreases downwards (Lee & Edwards, 1986;Hampton et al., 1996). The steepest part of the slope, not the average inclination, is critical for slide initiation. Once a slide is initiated, it will destabilize or erode flatter, initially stable zones, as seen in the Weggis Slide and Zinnen Slide examples. In the studied area, slopes with a maximum inclination of <10°generally remained stable during the 1601 AD, magnitude 6AE2 earthquake. Stronger earthquakes will, however, destabilize flatter slopes (Urgeles et al., 2002), and delta environments will show a different stability from the lateral slopes of a basin because deltaic sedimentation rates are higher and the sediment is coarser and, therefore, more susceptible to liquefaction (Tsuchida & Hayashi, 1971). Additionally, shear strength and, thus, slope stability may also have changed over time, in particular from the Late Glacial to Holocene periods.\n\nA new, 2 m thick sediment drape has been deposited on the slide plane of the St Niklausen Slide since its last failure dated at 2420 cal yr BP (Fig. 11). The new drape was not destabilized by the 1601 AD earthquake, indicating either a higher magnitude for the prehistoric earthquake event or a greater stability of the thin recent drape compared with the presumably thicker drape triggered by the 2420 cal yr BP event. This can be explained by the additional weight of a thicker drape, which increases the gravitational stress acting on a potential failure surface.\n\nIn the examples presented, the massflow deposits form lobes with a radial decrease in thickness and distinct pinch-out points (e.g. Figs 5 and 6). The sharp slope breaks are regarded as responsible for the relatively thick marginal wedges because the sudden break in slope would lead to rapid flowdeceleration, and, as a consequence, to enhanced sediment deposition (Nemec, 1990). The fact that the turbidites generally overlie the massflow deposits indicates relatively high velocities of Fig. 13. Photograph of core 4WS00-3P, which recovered the massflow deposits of the St Niklausen Slide and underlying deformed basinplain sediment. Position of the core segment shown is denoted on the lithological log in Fig. 12B. The megaturbidite and the mudclast conglomerate deposits in the upper part of the core photograph (3AE05-3AE48 m core depth) are characterized by a relatively high degree of disintegration. Further below, deformation is concentrated in relatively narrow shear zones between undisturbed sediment blocks.\n\nthe slides and massflows with durations of less than a minute to a few minutes from slide initiation to massflow deposition.\n\nThe slope-adjacent, basin-plain sediment is often deformed by the impact and weight of the descending material (e.g. Figs 8C and 12A). As a chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies is a possible acoustic signature for both massflow deposits and deformed basin-plain sediments, the two types of deposits may be indistinguishable on seismic sections. Distinguishing between them is not any easier in cores because the sliding material, as well as the deformed basin-plain sediment, is mainly of Holocene age, and small coherent blocks of these strata can be found in both massflow deposits and deformed basin-plain sediment.\n\nIn distal positions, the massflow deposits consist of both relatively small blocks of folded and remoulded strata and a more disintegrated mudclast conglomerate (Fig. 9). These deposits overlie almost undisturbed basin-plain sediment (Figs 5,6,8B and 12). The lack of erosion may be explained by hydroplaning, which has been shown to considerably decrease the remobilization capacity of subaqueous massflows (Mosher et al., 1994;Mohrig et al., 1998).\n\nTwo of the four slide complexes described (Weggis and St Niklausen slides) include megaturbidites. These bodies are unusual for the study area with thicknesses clearly exceeding the floodgenerated turbidites in these basins. The megaturbidites build clear entities with distinct and relatively smooth upper and lower boundaries that can easily be detected in cores as well as in seismic sections (Figs 8,9,12 and 13). Whereas the main, homogeneous, clayey part of the megaturbidite deposits is imaged as a transparent seismic facies, its sandy to silty base results in a strong basal reflection on seismic sections. The graded base and the lack of clasts of older strata within the deposits point towards a complete suspension of the sediment before deposition.\n\nThe megaturbidite deposits are thickest in the deepest part of confined basins and overlie either related massflow deposits or undisturbed basinplain sediment (Figs 7 and 10). In contrast to the open ocean, the suspended material can be easily trapped in the confined basins on fjord and lake floors, resulting in relatively thick turbiditic deposits. Part of the material is likely to have become suspended during sliding, in particular as an effect of the hydraulic changes associated with the sharp lower slope break (Komar, 1971;Kelts & Hsu ¨, 1980;Nemec, 1990). However, only massflows with a certain size and a considerable vertical transport distance will produce substantial turbulence to produce thick megaturbidite deposits. This may explain why no evidence of a (mega)turbidite related to the Chru ¨ztrichter Slide could be detected on seismic sections in the small pond adjacent to the depositional lobe.\n\nExtension (1AE5 km 2 ) and volume (>1 Mio. m 3 ) of the megaturbidite related to the St Niklausen Slide are rather large compared with the moderate size of the failed slope (0AE25 km 2 ). In fact, the same megaturbidite also overlies five other massflow deposits, which all relate to the same seismic triggering event (2420 cal yr BP ;Schnellmann et al., 2002). All these massflows are likely to have produced suspension clouds, which finally merged in the basin plain. Historic descriptions and numerical modelling indicate tsunami and seiche action induced by the multiple slide events of 1601 AD and 2420 cal yr BP (Cysat, 1969;Schnellmann et al., 2002;Schwarz-Zanetti et al., 2003). Siegenthaler et al. (1987) calculated that the currents induced by the 1601 AD seiche could have put considerable amounts of sediment into suspension. Consequently, the megaturbidites are interpreted as combined products of sediment put into suspension by multiple sliding, tsunami and seiche action.\n\nThe deep and relatively far-reaching deformation structures in the slope-adjacent basin-plain sediments underlying the massflow deposits are a striking characteristic common to all four described slide complexes from Lake Lucerne. Although such deep-reaching deformation in overridden lake-and seafloor sediments has been described by other authors (Shilts & Clague, 1992;Syvitski & Schafer, 1996), both the architecture and formation of these deformation structures remain poorly understood.\n\nThe seismic expression of the deformed basinplain sediment can be assigned to two endmembers: (1) acoustically layered, coherent blocks that are separated by faults (e.g. Fig. 5); and (2) an unstructured, chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies (e.g. Fig. 12A). The block size tends to be largest at the distal deformation front and decreases towards the proximal part of the deformed zone (Fig. 5A). Where, as a result of deformation and remoulding, the size of internally coherent and undisturbed blocks falls below the seismic resolution, the acoustic facies turns into a chaoticto-transparent type. Considering the limited horizontal resolution of the seismic signal (R fres ¼ 6AE5 m for 100 m water depth) and the shotpoint spacing of 0AE7-0AE9 m, a block must have a diameter of several metres to be resolved on a seismic image. A chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies therefore, does not necessarily reflect completely distorted sediment, but can also image deposits including fairly large, internally undisturbed sediment blocks. In fact, the cores taken through acoustically chaotic-to-transparent deposits still revealed undisturbed and coherent sediment packages separated by localized shear zones (Fig. 12B). As such shear zones are sometimes narrow, cores taken through seismically chaotic-to-transparent zones can appear to be undisturbed. Correlation between closely spaced cores is very useful to identify allochthonous sediment blocks and to distinguish disturbed from stratigraphically undisturbed sediment. Where reference cores through undisturbed sediments are missing, or where correlation between individual cores is unclear because of the lack of distinct lamination, palaeomagnetic methods can be applied. Block rotations, folds and shear zones result in unusual changes of the magnetic inclination/declination along core (Schnellmann, 2004).\n\nThe quasi-3D seismic information on the general structure and kinematics of deformed basin-plain sediment reveal a range of thin-skinned deformation structures, in particular ramp anticlines and imbricated thrusts (Figs 5,8C and 12A). The de ´collement of these structures lies in Late Glacial deposits, except for the St Niklausen Slide, where it is located in mid-Holocene sediments. Seismic lines indicate that the de ´collements occur in a zone rather than along a single layer (e.g. Fig. 8C). The core through the slope-adjacent basin-plain sediments deformed by the St Niklausen Slide (core 4WS00-3P in Fig. 12B) shows a 1 m thick, intensely deformed basal de ´collement zone. Above this basal zone, the deformation is less intense and concentrated on small cm-to dm-scale shear zones. Similar to the glide plane of a slide, the depth of such de ´collements is controlled by the geotechnical properties of the sediment. Although shear strength generally increases with depth, this increase is irregular and weaker layers or zones with a higher pore pressure may control the development of de ´collements.\n\nIn the case of the Zinnen and Weggis slides, parts of the massflow deposits clearly bulge upward as a result of the frontal thrust (Figs 6 and 8). A slight bulge in the lake floor directly above the deformation front can also be seen in the other examples (Figs 5 and 12A). These observations point towards deformation during and possibly after massflow deposition. In the case of the Weggis Slide, it can clearly be shown that the major part of the deformation must have developed syndepositionally.\n\nThe typically curved thrust fronts (Figs 2, 7 and 10) indicate a radial compressive stress field and are interpreted as a result of gravity spreading induced by the successive loading of the slopeadjacent basin-plain sediment during deposition of a single massflow. The loading is regarded as an effect of (1) the increasing weight of the massflow wedge and (2) the impact and passage of the descending mass over the sharp lower slope break (Sassa et al., 1985;Lee et al., 1999). A distinct lower slope break is, therefore, regarded as a key element for effective basin-plain deformation because it favours both a sharp deflection of the pathway and the build up of a steep marginal massflow wedge.\n\nFigure 14 shows a schematic model proposed for the development of slope-adjacent basin-plain deformation as a consequence of static and dynamic loading of the lake floor during an individual slide event. It is mainly based on observations from the Zinnen, St Niklausen and Weggis slides, which are on three different scales and, in a simplified way, represent three successive stages in the evolution of basin-plain deformation. As the descending masses reach the basin plain, a marginal wedge begins to build up (Fig. 14A). This wedge grows until it becomes unstable. Its incipient collapse induces gravity spreading (e.g. Schack Pederson, 1987;Schultz-Ela, 2001) and the first overthrusting in the adjacent basin-plain sediment (Fig. 14B). The Zinnen Slide is an example of such an early stage of wedge collapse and the associated deformation of the underlying basin-plain sediment. If the transported volume is high and more slide and massflow material is deposited at the foot of the slope, the depositional wedge grows and, as a consequence, the deformation intensifies and propagates towards more distal areas, leading successively to the geometries displayed by the St Niklausen and Weggis slides (Fig. 14C-E).\n\nWith a dense grid of high-resolution seismic profiles, four slide complexes of variable size are shown to have similar architectural characteristics reflecting a common depositional evolution. The distinctive sedimentary and bottom topographic conditions of fjord-type Lake Lucerne have strongly influenced the style of mass movement and the resulting deposits. Thus, the redepositional processes and products analysed in this study are likely to occur in similar settings in both marine and lacustrine environments, as well as those preserved in outcrops.\n\nThe following are the principal conclusions of this study:\n\n1. Lateral sliding in Lake Lucerne has induced deep-and far-reaching deformation in the slopeadjacent basin-plain substrate sediments. The deformed zone typically displays a fold-and-thrust belt style structure showing typical analogues to thin-skinned tectonic structures, including ramp anticlines and imbricated thrusts with arcuate strikes and a basal de ´collement.\n\n2. The mainly syndepositional deformation is interpreted as resulting from increased loading of the basin-plain sediment during deposition of a massflow. The growth of the slope-adjacent massflow wedge leads to a successive propagation of the thrust front towards more distal sediments.\n\n3. The compression and deformation of the flat lake floor is favoured by the peculiar geometry of glacigenic lakes and fjords, which comprises steep slopes with sharp lower slope breaks. This basin geometry, moreover, enables an effective disintegration of the slide slabs and a rapid transformation to massflows and turbidity currents.\n\n4. The scars of the slides typically lie in areas with convex-up curvatures, reflecting the importance of the inclination on the stability of a slope. In the study area, no lateral slides were triggered on slopes with inclinations of <10°by the 1601 AD earthquake. The largely Holocene sedimentary drape on the steep subaqueous slopes of the lake is particularly susceptible to sliding. Thick drapes seem to be less stable compared with thin drapes. This can be explained by the increased gravitational stress induced by the additional weight of a thicker pile of sediments.  14. Schematic kinematic model proposed for the evolution of basin-plain deformation as deduced from the slides studied in Lake Lucerne. Dotted surfaces represent massflow deposits. Loading of the marginal basin floor during a massflow event is regarded as the driving mechanism for the development of basinward propagating fold-and-thrust deformation. Note that, in the very slope-prone area, the boundary (dashed line) between massflow deposits and deformed basin-plain sediments can generally not be identified on seismic sections as a result of their similar chaotic-to-transparent seismic facies.\n\n5. The massflow deposits build up wedgeshaped depositional geometries with distinct distal terminations. Whereas in seismic sections the deposits show a chaotic-to-transparent facies, clasts of intact strata are abundant in cores.\n\n6. Large massflow deposits are often linked to thick homogenous clay units with a sandy to silty base. Such megaturbidites are focused in the deepest part of confined basins and generally post-date massflow deposition. They are interpreted as the combined products of suspension clouds set up by synchronous sliding and the related tsunami and seiche waves.\n\nÓ 2005 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 52, 271-289\n\nM.
