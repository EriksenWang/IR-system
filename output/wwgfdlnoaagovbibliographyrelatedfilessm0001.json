    "full_text": "Isotopic analysis of Greenland ice cores (e.g., Grootes et al., 1993) suggests that large and rapid changes of climate occurred frequently during the last glacial and deglacial periods. For example, the isotopic (0180) temperature dropped very rapidly approximately 13,000 years ago, followed by the so-called Younger Dryas event (Y -D) when the isotopic temperature was almost as low as at the last glacial maximum. Faunal and palynological analyses indicate that during the cold Y -D period, surface temperatures were very low not only over the northern North Atlantic but also over Western Europe. The Y -D period lasted several hundred years and ended abruptly, as indicated by the records from Greenland ice cores. Broecker et al. (1985) suggested that such an abrupt change resulted from a very rapid change in the thermohaline circulation (THC) from one mode of ,operation to another. They further speculated that meltwater from continental ice sheets caused the capping of the oceanic surface by relatively freshwater in high North Atlantic latitudes and was responsible for the rapid weakening of THC and the abrupt cooling of climate.\n\nThis essay explores the physical mechanism of abrupt climate change based upon the results from a set of numerical experiments conducted at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of NOAA. Particularly, it attempts to elucidate the role of the thermohaline circulation (THC) in inducing the abrupt climate change. Broecker et al. (1988) speculated that the diversion of meltwater from the Mississippi to the St. Lawrence River was responsible for reducing the rate of deep-water formation during the Y -D. Although convincing evidence for this meltwater diversion at the beginning of the Y-D has not been found, it is likely that meltwater is the most effective in reducing the deep-water formation when it is discharged near the sinking region of the THC. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a high-latitude versus low-latitude discharge onto the North Atlantic for weakening of the THC, we conducted two numerical experiments. In the first experiment, freshwater is discharged onto high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, whereas in the second experiment it is discharged onto the subtropical latitudes.\n\nThis paper is a modified and shortened version of a recent paper by Manabe and Stouffer (1997), hereafter identified as MS97, for presentation at the IGBP PAGES First Open Science Meeting. It incorporates some of the perspectives which have been acquired since the publication of the paper. In the final section, it discusses the possibility of future change in the THC based upon the results of numerical experiments recently conducted at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of NOAA. increasing greenhouse gases, and will hereafter be called the coupled model, for simplicity. The structure and performance of the model were described by Manabe et al. (1991), hereafter identified as M91. Therefore, only a brief description of the model structure is given here.\n\nThe coupled model (Fig. 1) consists of general circulation models (GCM) of the atmosphere and ocean, and a simple model of the continental surface that involves the budgets of heat and water (Manabe, 1969). It is a global model with realistic geography limited by its resolution. It has nine vertical finite difference levels. The horizontal distributions of predicted variables are represented by spherical harmonics (15 associated Legendre functions for each of 15 Fourier components) and by gridpoint values (Gordon and Stern, 1982). The model uses a simple scheme of land-surface process to compute surface fluxes of heat and water. Insolation varies seasonally, but not diurnally. The model predicts cloud cover which depends only on relative humidity.\n\nThe ocean GCM (Bryan and Lewis, 1979)  Atmosphere ~surface stress ~precipitation --~~~-~::\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"'~-'\" ;;.;.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.: ;.;.;.;.;.;.:.;.;  Initial conditions for the time integration of the coupled model include realistic seasonal and geographical distributions of surface temperature, surface salinity, and sea ice of the present with which both the atmospheric and oceanic model states are nearly in equilibrium. When the time integration of the model starts from this initial condition, the model climate drifts toward its own equilibrium state, which differs from the initial condition described above. To reduce this drift, the fluxes of heat and water imposed at the oceanic surface (including sea ice-covered areas) of the coupled model are modified by amounts that vary geographically and seasonally but do not change from one year to the next (for details, see M91 and Manabe and Stouffer, 1994). Since the adjustments are determined prior to the time integration of the coupled model and are not correlated to the anomalies of SST (i.e., sea surface temperature) and SSS (i.e., sea surface salinity), which can develop during the integration, they are unlikely to either systematically amplify or damp the anomalies. Owing to the flux adjustment technique, the model fluctuates around a realistic equilibrium state.\n\nStarting from the initial condition that was obtained and described above, the coupled model is integrated over a period of 1000 years. Owing to the application of the flux adjustments, the mean trend in global mean surface air temperature during this period is only -O.O23°C century-i. The trend of global mean temperature in the deeper layers of the model ocean is somewhat larger at -O.O7°C century-i. This trend appears to result from the imperfection of the procedures used for determining the initial condition and time integration of the coupled model. The specific reasons for this trend, however, have not been identified and are under investigation.\n\nThe simulated modern state of the coupled oceanatmosphere system, which is obtained from the time integration described in Section 2.2 is used as the control for the freshwater experiments conducted in the present study. Instead, one could have used as a control a coupled model state of the last deglaciation period when a major fraction of the continental ice sheets of the last glacial period still remained. Since the response of the cold, glacial state of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to freshwater discharge could be different from the corresponding response of the interglacial, modern state (e.g. Winton, 1997), it is highly desirable to conduct the numerical experiments using boundary conditions of the last deglaciation period. However, we have not succeeded in simulating either the glacial or deglacial world satisfactorily using a coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Thus, we cannot help using the simulated modem state of the coupled model as a control and perturbed it with an input of freshwater into the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn addition to the control integration described in Section 2.2, two numerical integrations are conducted for the present study. The initial condition for both integrations is the state of the coupled model at the 500th year of the control integration. In the first freshwater integration (FWN), the freshwater is discharged at the rate of 0.1 Sv (one sverdrup = 106 m3 s -1) uniformly over the 50-700N belt of the North Atlantic Ocean (identified as domain A in Fig. 2) over the period of 500 years. After the termination of the freshwater discharge, the FWN is continued for the additional 750 years until the 1250th year. By comparing the FWN with the control integration over the corresponding period of 1250 years, the impact of freshwater input upon the coupled ocean-atmosphere model is investigated.\n\nIn the second freshwater integration (FWS), freshwater is discharged uniformly over the subtropical region, identified as domain B (20.25-29.25°N, 52.5°-90.00W) in Fig. 2, again at the rate of 0.1 Sv over the period of 500 years. This integration is completed at the 750th year (i.e., 250 years after the termination of the freshwater discharge).\n\nIn both numerical experiments, it is assumed that the temperature of discharged freshwater is identical to the local surface temperature of the ocean. Thus, the freshwater input changes only surface salinity without affecting surface temperature.\n\n4.1. FWN\n\nIn this section, we discuss the response of the coupled model in the FWN in which freshwater is discharged into the domain A, i.e., the 50-70oN belt of the North Atlantic Ocean, at the rate of 0.1 Sv over the period of 500 years. Toward the end of this sustained, massive freshwater discharge, the region of low sea surface salinity (SSS) spreads down to 30-40ON (Fig. 3), creating an intense halocline several hundred meters beneath the surface. The surface layer of relatively fresh, low-density water prevents the convective cooling of the water column and the production of negative buoyancy in the sinking region of the thermohaline circulation (THC) in the northern North Atlantic, thereby weakening the THC during the 500-year period of the freshwater discharge. The streamfunction of the meridional overturning in the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 4) indicates that the THC not only weakens but also becomes much shallower (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the northward flow of Antarctic bottom water extends northward, intensifying the reverse overturning cell near the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 4b). Following the termination of freshwater discharge on the 500th year, the THC reintensifies and fully recovers its original intensity and distribution by the 900th year (Fig. 4c).\n\nAs the intensity of the THC weakens, the surface currents in the North Atlantic Ocean also undergo marked changes, which can be inferred by comparing Fig. 5a and b. For example, the: North Atlantic Current, which extends from the Florida coast towards the Norwegian Sea, also weakens in the Atlantic throughout the period of the freshwater discharge. Thus, the warm, saline surface water in the subtropical Atlantic hardly penetrates into the northern North Atlantic Ocean towards the end of the 500-year period of freshwater discharge. On the other hand, the Subarctic Gyre and associated East Greenland Current become more intense and extend southwards. It is of particular interest that the intensified Labrador Current and its southeastward extension track the path of ice-rafted debris during the so-called Heinrich events (Bond et al., 1992), which appear to resemble the Y -0 event in many respects.\n\nAssociated with the weakening of the THC described above, the northward advection of the warm and saline surface water is reduced, causing a large reduction in sea surface temperature (SST) in the northern North Atlantic (Fig. 6). The local maximum in cooling located south of Greenland, however, is attributable to the intensification and the southward extension of the east Greenland Current (Fig. 5) which advects cold Arctic surface water southward.\n\nInterestingly, an extensive region of SST reduction appears not only in the North Atlantic but also in the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere. The cold anomalies in the Atlantic/Indian Ocean sector change approximately in phase with the cold anomalies in the North Atlantic and begin to weaken after the termination of the freshwater discharge. However, the cold anomalies in the Pacific sector of the Circumpolar Ocean continue to intensify until -300 years after the 401st-500th 5951 914 1347 := 10G~ -~ -::'0 12b--\"'-8-. \"-16e6f Fig. 4.

Preliminary analysis indicates that this anomaly results from the delayed weakening of the deep reverse THC cell involving the Antarctic Bottom Water in the Pacific Ocean. The weakening increases the mer-idional SST gradient of the Circumpolar Ocean and intensifies the surface westerlies which, in turn, reduces SST by enhancing the northward Ekman drift of cold surface water and sea ice and further increases the meridional SST gradient (MS97).\n\nThe freshwater-induced change of sea surface temperature described above affects the overlying atmosphere, causing a reduction in surface air temperature over extensive region (Fig. 7). The cooling is particularly large over the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas, and extends over not only Greenland but also the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Western Europe (Fig. 7). Also, small negative anomalies extend over most of the high northern latitudes. The cooling centered around Iceland increases until the end of the freshwater discharge (i.e., the 500th year of the experiment), but decreases rapidly thereafter and disappears completely by the 750th year. Negative anomalies also appear in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, extending to the Antarctic Continent. On the other hand, very small positive SST anomalies cover the rest of the world. The global mean change of surface air temperature are small throughout the course of the experiment because small but extensive positive temperature anomalies compensate for the large but geographically limited negative anomalies.\n\nThe distribution of the freshwater-induced change in surface air temperature described above is consistent with the signitures of significant Y -D cooling, which was prepared by D. Peteet (Broecker, 1995) based upon the analysis of oceanic and bog sediments (Fig. 8). Over the Western Europe and Labrador Peninsula, for example, polynological records indicate the Y -D cooling of significant magnitude, whereas they do not over most of North American Continent. The qualitative resemblance between the two patterns encourages the speculation that the cold climate of the Y -D could have resulted from the slow-down of the THC which was induced by an input of freshwater, such as the discharge of the meltwater from the continental ice sheets. The pattern of the modelgenerated change, however, does not extend sufficiently toward low latitudes compared to the pattern of the Y -Dj Allerod difference determined from proxy data. As discussed in Section 6, this discrepancy may be partly attributable to the fact that the freshwater flux is applied to the simulated, modern state of the coupled ocean-atmosphere model which is much warmer than the cold state of the deglacial period. Thus, the albedo feedback process involving sea ice and snow operates at higher latitudes, confining the freshwater-induced temperature change poleward of the regions of the Y-D cooling.\n\nThe model atmosphere is not a passive participant in the simulated cooling event. Associated with the cooling, a positive sea level pressure anomaly (max. -4 mb) with a meridionally elongated pattern develops around .. \"- 120E 150E 180 150W 120 90 60 30W 0 30 60 90 120E Fig. 6.

On the other hand, Marotzke (1990) noted that the weakening of the Icelandic Low leads to a reduction in the intensity of the westerlies, and accordingly, that of equatorward Ekmann drift currents which could contribute to the reintensification of the THC. In the present experiment, however, the positive southeastern Greenland (Fig. 9), resulting in the weakening and slight eastward shift of the Icelandic Low and a marked weakening of southerly wind over the Greenland Sea.

Peteet showing sites of ocean sediment (planktonic forams) and bog sediments (pollen grains) where records covering the interval of deglaciation are available. The pluses (minuses) indicate that the Younger Dryas event (Y -D) cooling is seen (not seen). Two pluses are added by the present authors at 43.5\"N, 29.9°W and 33.7\"N, 57.6°W, referring to the studies of Keigwin and Lehman (1994), and Keigwin and Jones (1989), respectively. The locations of the Greenland ice cores (all show the Y -D) are also given. The shaded region shows the area coverage of the ice cap at the time of the Y -0 (from Broecker. 1995). See also Fig. 6 of Peteet (1995) which indicates the global distribution of polynological evidence for the Y-O sealevel pressure anomaly does not extend westward far enough to reintensify the THC. Instead, it appears to contribute to further weakening of the THC as noted above.\n\nSuperimposed upon the weakening and intensification of the THC which occurs over the period of several centuries, is a multidecadal fluctuation of the THC which follows the sudden onset of the freshwater discharge at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. lOa). The timescale and the structure of the fluctuation resembles the internally generated, multidecadal oscillation found by Oelworth et al. (1993Oelworth et al. ( , 1997) ) in the control integration of the same coupled ocean-atmosphere model as described in Section 2.2. However, the amplitude of the fluctuation is much larger than that of the multidecadal oscillation identified by Oelworth et al. The multidecadal fluctuation of the THC is approximately in-phase with the corresponding fluctuations of SSS and SST. Shortly after the start of the water discharge, a very rapid drop of both SSS and SST occurs, followed by large oscillations of both variables with a timescale ranging from several decades to a century (Fig. lOb and c). The amplitudes of the oscillations gradually decrease until the termination of freshwater discharge (i.e., the 500th year) due to the growth of sea ice, which reduces the anomalies of both SST and SSS through melting and freezing. The amplitude, however, increases again a few hundred years later, generating repeated, almost abrupt warming and cooling with decadal time scale (Fig. lOb).\n\nBecause of the sudden onset of the freshwater discharge, the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean is capped by low salinity water with relatively low density. The capping reduces markedly the convective cooling of water, and accordingly, the production of negative buoyancy in the sinking region of the THC. Thus, the THC weakens almost instantaneously, inducing the multi- 4.2. FWS decadal oscillation which involves the multidecadal fluctuations of not only the intensity of the THC but also SSS and SST. The fluctuation in the density of near-\n\nIn this subsection, we evaluate the impact of the subtropical discharge of freshwater upon the coupled model in comparison to the high-latitude discharge experiment (i.e., FWN) described in the preceding subsection. As noted earlier, the magnitude and duration of the subtropical freshwater discharge are identical to those of the high-latitude discharge for easier comparison. However, the negative SSS anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean are much smaller in the FWS than in the FWN during the course of the experiments (compare Fig. 12a with Fig. 3). Thus, the total reduction of the THC intensity during the period of the freshwater discharge is smaller in the FWS than in the FWN by a factor of ,.., 5 (see Fig. 11 and lOa). As a matter of fact, the THC in the FWS stops weakening a few hundred years before the termination of the freshwater discharge in the 500th year of the experiment (Fig. 11). In sharp contrast to the FWN, in which the THC weakens markedly and negative SSS anomalies are enhanced in the northern North Atlantic due to the reduction in the northward advection of relatively saline surface water by the THC , the freshwater-induced, subtropical SSS anomalies in the FWS are reduced by oceanic advection and remain small in the entire North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe horizontal distributions of SST anomalies from the FWN and FWS may be compared by inspecting Figs. 6 and 12b. Again, the magnitude of negative SST anomalies is much less in FWS than in FWN. It is notable, however, that the two distributions of the SST anomalies resemble each other, with relatively large negative anomalies in the northern North Atlantic, the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, and the northwestern region of the Pacific Ocean. The distributions of the thermal responses of the coupled model are similar, not only at the surface but also in the subsurface layers of the model ocean.\n\nIn summary, the subtropical discharge of freshwater is much less effective in weakening the THC and altering the thermal structure of the oceans as compared with the high-latitude discharge in the FWN. In assessing the impact of a meltwater discharge upon a so-called abrupt climate change such as the Y -D event, it is therefore very important to reliably determine the location of the meltwater discharge. Southern Hemisphere. Upon termination of the freshwater discharge at the SOOth year of the experiment, the THC begins to reintensify, gaining its original intensity in a few hundred years. In contrast to the Pacific sector of the Circumpolar Ocean where surface air temperature does not begin to increase until the 800-900th year, the climate of the northern North Atlantic and surrounding regions starts recovering as soon as the freshwater discharge is terminated at the SOOth year of the experiment.\n\nThe sudden onset and termination of the massive discharge of freshwater also induces a multidecadal fluctuation in the intensities of the THC and convective activity which generate large synchronous fluctuations of both SST and SSS in the northern North Atlantic and surrounding Oceans. Such oscillation yields almost abrupt changes of climate which involves rapid rise and fall of surface temperature in a few decades. The rapid change or SST, thus generated, is almost as abrupt as the changes of SST at the beginning and the end of the Y-D period. In an earlier numerical experiment, Manabe and Stouffer (1995) generated an even more abrupt falls and rises of SST by increasing the rate of freshwater discharge. In response to the sudden onset of a massive discharge of freshwater into the northern North Atlantic at the rate of 1 Sv, the THC weakened very rapidly, thereby lowering the SST in Denmark Strait and surrounding regions. Upon suspension of the freshwater discharge, the THC exhibited a complex transient behavior, inducing an almost abrupt fall, rise and fall of SST during several decades followed by a gradual recovery toward the initial state. One can speculate that highfrequency fluctuations of isotopic temperature, which are evident in the high-resolution records from Greenland ice cores (e.g., Fig. 4 of Jouzel et al., 1995) may also be caused by the abrupt onset and termination of massive discharges of meltwater.\n\nThe pattern of the freshwater-induced cooling obtained here resembles the pattern of the Y -D cooling, as inferred from the comprehensive analysis of ice cores and deep-sea and lake sediments (see, for example, Broecker, 1995). However, the region of cooling in the North Atlantic and surrounding regions does not extend as far southward as that of the Y -D cooling. Furthermore, the simulated cooling at Summit, Greenland, appears to be smaller than the actual cooling estimated from the isotopic analysis of ice cores (e.g., GRIP Members, 1993). Although cooling also occurs in the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, it does not extend sufficiently northward to reach New Zealand, where the Franz Joseph glacier advanced during the Y -D (Denton and Hendy, 1994). We speculate that these discrepancies result partly from the use of the simulated modern climate as a control rather than the much colder climate of the last deglaciation period. The extensive coverage of sea ice during the cold deglaciation period could not 5. Concluding remarks\n\nIn response to the discharge of freshwater into a highlatitude belt of the North Atlantic Ocean, the THC of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model weakens, thereby reducing surface air temperature over the northern North Atlantic, the Nordic Seas, and Greenland, and to a lesser degree, over the Arctic Ocean, the Scandinavian peninsula, Labrador, and the Circumpolar Ocean of the only have extended the regions of cooling toward lower latitudes but could also have increased its magnitude. Therefore, it is desirable to conduct additional freshwater experiments using the simulated climate of the last deglaciation period as a control.\n\nImproving the earlier results of Guilderson et al. (1994), Guilderson (1996) obtained the high-resolution time series of SST based upon the Sr/Ca thermometry of Barbados corals. His time series indicates that the surface temperature of the western tropical Atlantic fell rapidly during the late Bolling period (between 15 and 13.8 kyr BP), when a massive discharge of freshwater (identified as mwp-IA by Fairbanks, 1989) took place. Guilderson et al. found that the tropical surface temperature rises rapidly upon termination of the mwp-IA (i.e., around 13.7 kyr BP). It is notable, however, that the Sr/Ca temperature in the tropical Atlantic did not change substantially at the beginning of the Y -0 (i.e., around 13 kyr BP), despite the abrupt drop of surface temperature in high Atlantic latitudes.\n\nThese findings are not inconsistent with the results of the present FWN experiment in which SST in tropical latitudes hardly changes (Fig. 10) despite the large meltwater-induced change in the intensity of the THC. On the other hand, the rapid fall ofSr/Ca temperature in the western tropical Atlantic during the late Bolling (between 15 and 13.8 kyr BP) could result from the cooling of the mixed-layer ocean caused by a massive discharge of cold freshwater into the Gulf of Mexico, as suggested by Guilderson (1996).\n\nOne should note, however, that Thompson et al. (1995) found evidence of the Y -0 cooling in the tropical atmosphere based upon the isotopic analysis of two ice cores obtained from the col of Huascaran (90 06' S, 770 36' W). In view of the fact that simulated SST increases very slightly from middie-to-iow latitudes in response to the freshwater discharge, the tropical cooling during the Y-o may not be caused by the weakening of the THC which was induced by the discharge of freshwater. Instead, it may have been caused by other factors such as growth of continental ice sheets with high albedo and the reduction in the atmospheric concentration of methane (Chappellaz et al., 1993). much less effective for weakening the THC in the FWS in which freshwater is discharged to the subtropical Atlantic.\n\nThe contrast between the results from these two experiments encourages the speculation that, at the beginning of the Y -D period, a large amount of meltwater was discharged into high rather than low North Atlantic latitudes. As noted in the introduction of this paper, Broecker et al. (1988) speculated that meltwater was diverted from the Mississippi to the St. Lawrence Rivers around that time. However, de Vernal et al. (1996) did not find convincing evidence for such diversion. One could therefore speculate that the northward transport of heat by the active THC during the warm period of Allerod could have induced the accelerated melting of the Fennoscandian Ice sheets. The increase in the runoff of meltwater in turn slowed down the THC in the Atlantic Ocean. This speculation appears to be consistent with the high-resolution records of oxygen isotopes and the summer SSTs determined from the taxonomic composition of diatoms in a Norwegian Sea Core (Karpuz and Jansen, 1992). Despite the rapid drop of the diatom temperature from the Allerod to Y -D, the oxygen isotope anomaly (adjusted for global ice volume) decreases steadily with time, suggesting the possible discharge of meltwater from the Fennoscandian Ice sheets at the onset of the cold Y -D period.\n\nAs noted already, the coral records of sea level indicate that the so called meltiwater pube lA (mwp-lA) ended several hundred years before the onset of the Y -D (Fairbanks, 1989;Bard et al., 1996). Keigwin et al. (1991) and Fairbanks et al. (1992) traced a possible origin of this meltwater discharge back to the Gulf of Mexico. The comparison between the FWN and FWS experiments suggests that the subtropical discharge of meltwater such as the mwp-lA may be much less effective than the highlatitude discharge in weakening the THC. However, the massive amount of freshwater involved in the mwp-lA could be sufficient to weaken the THC significantly and induce the cooling of the past Bolling period (between 15 and 13.8 kyr BP).\n\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, the North Atlantic discharge of freshwater affects the sea surface temperature in the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere. However, the isotopic analysis of Antarctic ice cores reveals that a period of cooling, called Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR), occurred at least 1000 years before the Y -D (Jouzel et al., 1995). Therefore, it is not very likely that the abrupt cooling of North Atlantic at the beginning of the Y -D is associated with the ACR. Instead, one can speculate that the rapid cooling of North Atlantic during the post-Bolling period could be related to the ACR. Recently, Steig et al. (1998) identified the abrupt warming at the end of the Y -D in an ice core from the Taylor Dome located in the western Ross Sea Section of Antarctica. It appears that the results of 5.2.\n\nTwo numerical experiments are conducted in the present study. In the first experiment discussed above (FWN), freshwater is discharged into the high North Atlantic latitudes which include the sinking regions of the THC, whereas freshwater is applied to a region of the subtropical Atlantic in the second experiment (FWS). In the FWN, the THC weakens because of the capping of the sinking regions by relatively fresh, low-density surface water. On the other hand, the negative SSS anomaly over the sinking regions is much smaller and ice core analysis described above do not contradict with the results from the numerical experiments conducted here. 5.3. Two stable equilibria Manabe and Stouffer (1988) found that their coupled ocean-atmosphere model has at least two stable equilibria with active and inactive modes of the THC in the North Atlantic Ocean. The active mode resembles the current state of the THC with a sinking region in the northern North Atlantic, whereas the inactive mode is characterized by a weak, reverse cell of the THC with sinking motion in the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere and no ventilation of subsurface water in the North Atlantic Ocean. They suggested that an oceanic state similar to the inactive mode prevailed during the period of the Y -D. Paleoceanographic evidence, however, does not necessarily support this suggestion. Although the deep-sea cores from the North Atlantic Ocean indicate markedly reduced deep-water formation (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987;Keigwin and Lehman, 1994), the distribution of benthic 013C estimated by Sarnthein et al. (1994) suggests that an upper deep-water production of significant magnitude did occur during the Y -D. Paleoceanographic evidence (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987;Duplessy et al., 1988) indicates that the Atlantic Ocean of the Last Glacial Maximum (LG M) is also significantly different from the inactive mode of the THC obtained by Manabe and Stouffer (1988). It is characterized by not only the absence of lower deep -water production and enhanced northward penetration of the Antarctic bottom water, but also significant ventilation of the upper deep-water. Thus, it is likely that the North Atlantic Ocean of the Y -0 or the LGM are more similar to the transient state of the weakened and shallow THC (obtained from the present experiment) than the equilibrium state of the inactive THC obtained earlier by Manabe and Stouffer (1988).\n\nThe coupled model used here also possesses the two stable equilibria which are similar to those obtained by Manabe and Stouffer (1988). Once it is induced, the state of the inactive mode of the reverse THC is stable and remains unchanged over the period of at least several thousand years. Despite the heating due to the vertical thermal diffusion, the temperature of the bottom water does not increase because of the cooling due to the formation of the Antarctic bottom water. Thus the stratification of the deeper layer of the model ocean remains unchanged, preventing the re-activation of the THC.\n\nThese results differ from what Schiller et al. (1997) obtained using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model developed at the Max-Planck-Institute (MPI) in Hamburg, Germany. In response to the input of a massive amount of freshwater, the THC of the MPI model collapsed into the inactive, mode of the reverse THC, which is qualitatively similar to the inactive mode obtained by Manabe and Stouffer (1988). However, upon termination of the freshwater discharge, the THC intensified rapidly, eventually regaining its original intensity, in sharp contrast to the behavior of the inactive, reverse mode obtained by Manabe and Stouffer (1988). The difference in behavior between the GFDL and MPI models identified above may be attributable to the difference in the magnitude of diapycnal diffusion in them. Specifically, the oceanic component of the coupled model used by Schiller et al. (1997) employs the first-order, upstream finite difference technique for the computation of advection and, therefore, has relatively large implicit, computational diffusion (see, for example, Wurtele, 1961;and Molenkamp, 1968). It is likely that the large diapycnal diffusion of potential temperature and salinity facilitates the movement of water across isopycnal surfaces, resulting in the reintensification of the THC and the resumption of North Atlantic deep-water formation which occurred after the termination of massive freshwater discharge in the numerical experiment conducted by Schiller et al., 1997. In order to evaluate this speculation, we recently conducted a similar freshwater experiment using a modified version of the GFDL coupled model in which the coefficient of vertical subgrid scale diffusion in the upper 2 km layer of oceans is several times larger than in the standard version (Manabe and Stouffer, 1999). Although the reverse THC was produced in this version of the coupled model in response to the massive discharge of freshwater, it began to transform rapidly back to the original, direct THC as soon as the freshwater discharge was terminated, in qualitative conformity with the behavior of the MPI model.\n\nOur results clearly indicate that the inactive mode of the reverse THC is not a stable state in a coupled model which has a large diapycnal diffusion coefficient for oceanic subgrid scale mixing. Measurement of the invasion of anthropogenic tracers, such as bomb tritium and 3He, have indicated that the coefficient of vertical diapicnal mixing in the ocean thermocline of the subtropical North Atlantic is less than 0.1 cm2 S-l (Jenkins, 1980) or about 0.2 cm2 s -1 (Rooth and Ostlund, 1972).\n\nBased upon the results from a recent field experiment (Ledwell et al., 1994), the most likely value of the effective vertical diffusion coefficient in the ocean thermocline is 0.1-0.2 cm2 S-l. Even the standard version of the GFDL coupled model, which has the inactive, reverse THC, has a larger vertical diffusion coefficient than these values. Therefore, it is likely that the mode of the reverse THC is also stable in the real Atlantic Ocean in which vertical diffusion appears to be small. When a coupled model with sufficiently low vertical diffusion coefficient enters the stable state of the reverse THC, it does not get out of it easily (see also Rahmstorf, 1995). This is another important reason why we believe that the cold state of Y -D was not a stable state of no deep-water formation in the North Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it is a temporarily weakened state of the THC. As noted already, the paleoceanographic signature of deepwater formation is consistent with this assertion. the THC. Because of the weakening, the northward advection of warm, saline water is reduced, moderating the warming in the North Atlantic and surrounding regions (see also Manabe (1991) for further discussion). The multiple century response of the THC to the doubling and quadrupling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration was the subject of extensive discussion in the studies of Manabe and Stouffer (1994). The last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1996) compares the greenhouse gas-induced changes in THC which have been obtained from various coupled ocean-atmosphere models constructed by various groups. In order to detect future change in the intensity of the THC, it is urgent to monitor the structure of water masses in not only the North Atlantic but also the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas.\n\nThe results obtained here could be relevant to the future change of climate. For example, a recent studies by Haywood et al. (1997) and Manabe (1998) reveal that, in response to the time-dependent, radiative forcing by not only greenhouse gases but also anthropogenic sulfate, the THC begins to weaken sometime during the first half of the 21st century (Fig. 13). Associated with the warming of the model atmosphere, the poleward transport of water vapor in the atmosphere increases, resulting in the marked increase in precipitation in high latitudes, and accordingly, the increased freshwater supply to the Arctic and surrounding oceans. Thus, these oceans are covered by near-surface water of low salinity, thereby weakening\n\nS. Manabe. R.J. Stouffer I Quaternary Science Reviews 19 (2000) 285-299 f-."
