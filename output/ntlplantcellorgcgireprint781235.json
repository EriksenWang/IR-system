    "abstract": "McClintock's analysis of chromosome-breaking Dissociation (Ds) elements in maize demonstrated that sister chromatids fuse at the position of Ds, forming a dicentric chromosome and an acentric fragment. In tobacco, Ds left and right ends e in direct orientation (that is, half a double Ds) are sufficient to promote Ac!ivator-dependent marker gene loss. We present here a detailed analysis of germinally inherited rearrangements promoted by \"half double Ds\" elements and a characterization of rearrangements that involve inversion of the segment between the Ds ends and/or deletion of a segment adjacent to the Ds construct. The results support a model in which chromosome breakage promoted by these elements, and presumably by double Ds elements, involves Ds ends on sister chromatids.",
    "full_text": "first observed transposable element activity in maize as the loss of endosperm marker genes due to chromosome breakage. Chromosome breaks initiate at a locus called Dissociafion (Ds) if a second element, Acfivafor (Ac), is present in the genome (McClintock, 1947). Sister chromatids fuse at the position of Ds, forming dicentric and acentric chromosomes. During anaphase, the dicentric chromosome forms a bridge and breaks ata random position. The concept of transposition was based on changes in the position where chromosome breakage was initiated (McClintock, 1948). 60th Ac and Ds transpose (McClintock, 1948(McClintock, , 1949)).\n\nTransposition of Ac and Ds elements into other genes generates new mutable alleles (McClintock, 1948(McClintock, , 1949(McClintock, , 1951)). Mutable alleles caused by Ds insertions are controlled by Ac and revert to wild-type function only when Ac is present in the genome. Different \"states\" of Ds elements are defined based on their relative ability to effect chromosome breakage and reversion. There is an inverse relationship between the two outcomes: Ds elements that break chromosomes revert infrequently, and Ds elements that revert frequently, break chromosomes rarely (McClintock, 1949).\n\nNonbreaking Ds elements characterized so far have simple structures (Fedoroff et al., 1983;Fedoroff, 1989). On the other hand, Ds elements involved with chromosome breakage have more complex structures, characterized by the presence of multiple transposable element ends in close proximity (Courage-Tebbe et al., 1983;Weck et al., 1984;Ralston et al., 1989;Weil and Wessler, 1993). Chromosome breakage at Severa1 maize alleles has been correlated with the presence of a \"double Ds\" element (Figure 1) that was formed by insertion of a 2-kb Ds, To whom correspondence should be addressed. in an inverted orientation, into another, identical Ds (Courage-Tebbe et al., 1983;Weck et al., 1984;Doring et al., 1989). An engineered double Ds element in tobacco behaves like a chromosome-breaking Ds element with respect to marker gene loss and reversion, and a left end (LE) and a right end (FIE) of Ds in direct orientation (that is, half a double Ds) are sufficient for Ac-dependent marker gene loss (English et al., 1993). Examples of these different types of Ds structures are shown in Figure 1.\n\nIn a model for normal transposition, Ac transposase (TPASE) brings the Ds LE and RE together (Figure 26). After excision, the sequences that originally flanked the Ds ends (A and 6) are ligated to form an \"empty donor site\" (Figure 2C), and Ds reintegrates in a new position (Figure 2D). With this model as a reference point, two models have been proposed to show how aberrant transpositions involving the Ds LE and RE in direct rather than inverted orientation could result in chromosome breakage. In the sister chromatid substrate (SIS) model (Fedoroff, 1989;English et al., 1993), the Ds LE and RE from sister chromatids participate in an aberrant transposition event (Figures 2E to 2H). In contrast, in the single chromatid substrate (SIN) model (Doring and Starlinger, 1984;English et al., 1993), the aberrant transposition involves Ds ends on the same chromatid (Figures 21 to 2L).\n\nThe proposed mechanisms for chromosome breakage are not mutually exclusive, and they both predict (although at different frequencies) the formation of acentric and dicentric chromatids and other Ds-induced rearrangements described by McClintock (English et al., 1993). With the SIS model, all events lead to chromatid fusion because R'remains joined to A'-Y'-X, and 6' is joined to sequence A-YX on the other chromatid (Figure 2G). In contrast, with the SIN model, onlyevents TransDosition A Bk ! A r B 6 T a g s i t e Reintegration 4 R,D r\n\nin which R is inserted in the sister chromatid (a common event; see Greenblatt, 1984) result in chromatid fusion (Figure 2L).\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments showed that when Ac TfASEwas present, half Ds inversions consistent with the SIS or SIN models occurred in both tobacco and the double Ds-carrying maize sh-m:5933 allele (Courage-Tebbe et al., 1983;English et al., 1993). That is, rearrangements corresponding to the joining of sequence A with sequence B, or B'(Figures 2G and 2K), were detected. Similar results were also obtained with two maize waxy alleles that contain closely linked, inverted Ds elements (Weil and Wessler, 1993).\n\nPCR experiments revealed aberrant excisions involving the Ds LE and RE in direct orientation. However, severa1 questions remained unanswered.  that results in heritable loss of genetic markers and chromosome breakage?\n\nTo address these points, an extensive analysis was undertaken of individual genetically detected DNA rearrangements involving the Ds LE and RE in direct orientation. One set of experiments utilized tobacco plants carrying \"inversion detection\" constructs SU4303 and SU5172, which were specifically designed to permit selection of an inverted half Ds element. In these constructs, a half double Ds element carries a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35s promoter directing transcription away from an adjacent promoterless streptomycin resistance (SPT) marker gene (Maliga et ai., 1988;Jones et al., 1989). When the half Ds is inverted, SPTis activated; activation of Smreflects the fusion of sequence 8, or B, to sequence A, which previously flanked the Ds RE (Figures 21 and 2E, respectively). The SPTvariegation assay showed that half Ds inversions occurred at a substantial frequency. DNA gel blot analysis of germinally transmitted rearrangements showed that structures predicted by the SIS model were formed in most cases. Another set of experiments utilized transformed tobacco &me SLJ4303 SLJ5172 Structure LB plants carrying the \"marker loss\" constructs LE,RE/SPT and RE,LE/SPT (English et ai., 1993). In these experiments, germinally inherited rearrangements that resulted in loss of SPT function were characterized. Again, results consistent with the occurrence of the SIS model were obtained.\n\nT-DNA vectors were made to permit selection of half Ds inversions in transgenic tobacco. T-DNA regions of the \"inversion detection\" constructs pSLJ4303 and pSLJ5172 are shown in Figure 3. Both contain a Ds LE and a Ds RE in direct orientation. The half Ds that may be inverted contains a CaMV 35s promoter. The LE,RE structure was inserted adjacent to the right (as shown) of a promoterless SPT marker gene (Maliga et ai., 1988;Jones et al., 1989) such that SPT would only be RB GUS HPT SPT 35s BAR Probe fragments --SPT DsRE DsLE LB RB HPT SPT 35s GUS LB RB LE, REISPT GUS NPT SPT LB RB RE, LEISPT GUS NPT SPT Event Assaved lnversion lnversion Marker loss Marker loss Figure 3. T-DNA Regions of Binary Vector Constructs. In constructs SLJ4303 and SW5172, a Ds element designed for detection of the inversion of a half Ds was inserted adjacent to a promoterless SPT gene. The orientation of the 35s promoter is indicated by a small open arrowhead. Constructs LE,RE/SPT and RE,LE/SPT contain the Ds LE and RE in direct orientation adjacent to a functional SPT gene (English ei al., 1993). The Ds LE and RE are indicated by large open and closed arrowheads, respectively. lndicated are the nopaline synthase (nos) 3' end; octopine synthase (ocs) 3' end; T-DNA left border (LB) and right border (RB). The direction of transcription for each gene is indicated by an arrow. Both SLJ4303 and SW5172 contain a hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) gene (Gritz and Davies, 1983) as a selection for plant transformation because the tines carrying Ac TPASE genes were already kanamycin resistant. Construct pSW4303 has a GUS marker gene (Jefferson et al., 1987) on the SPTside of the inversion detection structure and a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (BAR) gene (DeBlock et al., 1987), which confers resistance to the herbicide Basta (phosphinothricin), on the other side. Construct pSLJ5172 has a GUS gene on the other side of the half double Ds from the SPT gene. Open boxes represent the 2'1' Agrobacterium promoter fragment and nopaline synthase and octopine synthase 3' ends. Filled boxes represent 35s promoters. Stippled boxes represent gene coding sequences. Striped boxes represent Ds sequences.\n\nexpressed from the 35S promoter if the half Ds element were inverted. Both pSLJ4303 and pSLJ5172 have a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (Gritz and Davies, 1983) as a selectable marker for plant transformation. In addition, pSLJ4303 has the screenable marker gene p-glucuronidase (GUS; Jefferson et al., 1987) to the left of the Ds sequences and the selectable marker gene phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (DeBlock et al., 1987) to the right; pSLJ5172 has GUS to the right of the Ds sequences. Constructs pSLJ4303 and pSLJ5172 were introduced into previously transformed tobacco lines that were expressing Ac TPASE and also into untransformed tobacco. The Ac TPASE sources were either stabilized Ac (sAc), which expresses Ac TPASE from the Ac promoter, or 355'TPASE, which expresses Ac TPASE horn a CaMV 35S promoter (Scofield et al., 1992).\n\nThe marker loss constructs LE,RE/SP7and RE.LE/SP7(Figure 3; English et al., 1993) carry one half, or the other, of double Ds adjacent to a functional SP7 gene. A neomycin phosphotransferase gene was used as a selectable marker, and GUS is present as an additional screenable marker. Tobacco lines carrying these constructs and the 35S:7fWS£gene, designated LE,RE/SP7(35S:7P4S£) and RE,LE/SP7(35S:7R4Sf), were used to analyze rearrangements that resulted in SP7\"and GUS gene loss adjacent to the Ds sequences.\n\nSix SLJ4303 transformants were generated in wild-type tobacco (that is, lacking Ac TPASE). Six SLJ5172 transformants were generated in wild-type tobacco. Self-progeny from these transformants were completely white (streptomycin-sensitive [Str s ]) when germinated on streptomycin-containing medium (SCM). Each transformant was also crossed to Ac TPASE-carry'mg tobacco plants. Ten of the 12 transformants produced Ac TPASE testcross progeny with green (streptomycin-resistant [Str r ]) sectors when germinated on SCM. Typical variegation is shown in Figure 4A. This/to 7PAS£-dependent variegation suggests that half Ds inversions, previously identified by PCR experiments, occur at a substantial frequency. (B) Testcross progeny from transformant SLJ5172B (sAc) showing a germinal inversion event (fully green seedling) as well as variegated seedlings. (C) Testcross progeny from transformant SU4303B (35S:TRAS£) showing a germinal inversion event. (D) Testcross progeny from a line carrying LE.RE/SPT (35S:TPASE) showing some completely white individuals that have germinally lost the SPT gene. All crosses were between the aforementioned genotypes and tobacco cultivar Petite Havana.\n\nTo characterize further the DNA rearrangements that accompanied half Ds inversions, sufficient quantities of material were required for DNA gel blot analysis. To produce this material, SLJ4303 and SLJ5172 transformants were generated in previously transformed, Ac TPASE-expressing lines so that germinally transmitted rearrangements could be recovered. Three transformants were identified that contained simple, intact SLJ4303 or SLJ5172 T-DNA insertions (data not shown). Transformants SLJ4303A (sAc) and SLJ51726 (sAc) each had a single inversion detection T-DNA insert. Transformant SLJ5172A (35S:TPASf) had two inversion detection T-DNA inserts. Each transformant was testcrossed to untransformed tobacco. Progeny were germinated on SCM. In addition tosomatic variegation, fully Strr seedlings were observed (Figures 46 and 4C). These presumably arose due to germinally transmitted inversion events. The frequencies with which fully Strr seedlings were observed are listed in Table 1 (marker gain column).\n\nTo test whether loss of GUS function was associated with gain of SPT function, 10 fully green SW51726 progeny were histochemically assayed for GUS activity. Each of these individuals retained GUS activity (data not shown).\n\nTo characterize further the DNA rearrangements that accompanied half Ds inversions, fully Strr seedlings were grown to maturity, DNA was extracted, and DNA gel blot analysis was performed. To maximize the chances of examining genetically independent events, individuals from different seed capsules were used whenever possible. lndividuals from different capsules were considered to be derived from independent events, in keeping with previous observations of independent Ac and Ds excision events in tobacco (Scofield et al., 1992; J.J. English, S.R. Scofield, and J.D.G. Jones, unpublished results). Individuals from the same capsule were considered to result from a clonal event unless they had different hybridization patterns in DNA gel blots.\n\nThe SIS and SIN models make different predictions about the DNA rearrangements that would result from aberrant transposition events involving Ds LE and RE in direct orientation. Common to both models is the inversion of a half Ds element. With the SIN mechanism, the inverted half Ds element would reinsert at an unknown position (Figure 2L). Thus, we have no way of predicting the lengths of the resulting restriction fragments. With the SIS model, on the other hand, the inverted half Ds would remain connected to known DNA sequences (Figure 2G). The restriction fragments that would result from the SIS mechanism are shown in Figure 5D.\n\nThe first experiment was designed to establish whether the fully Strr individuals carried the predicted inversion. As shown in Figure 5D, if the SIS mechanism occurred, an EcoRI-Xbal digest with the SPT probe would result in a 3.4-kb fragment associated with the inversion (corresponding to the segment X-Y-A-6' in Figure 2G) and a 4.2-kb fragment (corresponding to the segment X'-Y'-A'-R-B'in Figure 2G). As shown in Figure 5A, a 4.2-kb fragment would also be present in the unrearranged parent (corresponding to the segment X-Y-A-R-B in Figure 2E). The SIN model would also produce a 3.4-kb fragment (note segment X-Y-A-B in Figure 2L), but a parental band would not be present.\n\nFigure 6A shows DNA gel blots in which EcoRI-Xbaldigested DNA from primary transformants SLJ4303A (sAc) (lane 2) and SLJ51726 (sAc) (lane 12) and severa1 of their fully green progeny were hybridized with the SPTprobe (Figure 3).\n\nTransformants SLJ4303A (sAc) and SLJ51726 (sAc) have the expected 4.2-kb progenitor band. Each of the fully green progeny (lanes 3 to 10 and 13 to 16) has the 3.4-kb band associated with the inversion. In addition, samples in lanes 3, 5 to 8, 10, 13,14, and 16 (marked by dots) have the 4.2-kb parental band,\n\n2 35s: TPASE 35S:TPASE 35S:TPASE 35s: TPASE 35s: TPASE 35S:TPASE sAc sAc sAc sAc sAc sAc sAc sAc 35S:TPASE 35s: TPASE sAc sAc 10 935 4.2 885 5.0 633 2.6 791 0.5 593 2.2 408 2 268 O 235 1 223 2 199 0.3 286 1 274 1 284 0.4 243 0.5 643 0.9 678 0.5 194 2.1 472 Plants carrying the Ds constructs and containing an active Ac TPASE source were testcrossed as females with pollen from untransformed tobacco plants.

The frequency of marker loss is given as the percentage of seedlings predicted to inherit a Ds T-DNA that were StrS in the cases of LE,REISPT and RE,LEISPTand as the percentage of Basta-resistant seedlings that lost GUS activity in the case of SLJ4303. The percentage of marker gain refers to the percentage of seedlings that inherited the inversion detection T-DNA that were fully Str'. The Ac TPASE source present in the parent is indicated. The number of seedlings scored (n) is indicated. For SLJ4303A, marker loss and marker gain were scored on different sets of seedlings.

The sample in lane 15 has two bands in addition to the expected 3.4-kb band.\n\nFigure 6B shows DNA gel blots in which the same DNA samples were digested with EcoRI-Hindlll and probed with SPT (Figure 3). This digest should produce a 6.2-kb EcoRI-Hindlll fragment if the progenitor structure is present (Figure 5A) or a 7.6-kb EcoRl fragment if a rearrangement by the SIS mechanism has occurred (Figure 5D). As stated earlier, the SIN mechanism would produce a fragment of unpredictable size because the inverted half Ds would have reinserted at an unknown position. SW4303A (sAc) (lane 2) and SW5172B (sAc) (lane 12) have the predicted 6.2-kb progenitor band. Again, most of the fully green progeny (marked by dots) fit the SIS model, exhibiting the predicted 7.6-kb band. The sample in lane 16 also retains the 6.2-kb progenitor band. The samples in lanes 4 and 9 no longer have the 6.2-kb progenitor band but have new bands. The sample in lane 15 has two new bands.\n\nFigure 6C shows DNA gel blots of the same DNA samples, digested with BstEll and probed with the Ds RE probe (Figure 3). If the SIS mechanism occurred, a 1.6-kb fragment would be predicted (Figure 5D). If the SIN mechanism occurred, fragments of unpredictable sizes would be produced because of reinsertion of the inverted half Ds in a new position. A 6-kb progenitor band can be seen in SLJ4303A (sAc) (lane 2), and a 13-kb progenitor band can be seen in SLJ5172B (sAc) (lane 12). Most of the fully green progeny (marked by dots) show the 1.6-kb band predicted by the SIS model. The sample represented in lane 15 has the BstEll band predicted by the SIS model, although it did not have the predicted bands with the other two digests (Figures 6A and 6B). The samples in lanes 4 and 9 have new bands with lengths >1.6 kb.\n\nSamples in lanes 3,5 to 8, 10, 14, and 15 of Figure 6C have new bands in addition to the predicted 1.6-kb band, suggesting that the reciproca1 structure to the inversion (Figure 5E) Lanes 1 and 11 contain DNA from the sAc source. Lane 2 contains DNA from transformant SLJ4303A. Lanes 3 to 10 contain DNA from fully green testcross progeny from transformant SLJ4303A, and the contents are as follows: lane 3, capsule 1; lanes 4 to 6, capsule 2; lanes 7 to 9, capsule 3; lane 10, capsule 4 (see Table 1). Lane 12 contains DNA from transformant SU5172B. Lanes 13 to 16 contain DNA from fully green testcross progeny from transformant SU5172B, capsule 2 (Table 1). Lanes in which the predictions of the SIS model were fulfilled are marked by dots. may have reinserted in new positions in these individuals. The idea that reinsertion of Os ends usually accompanies the aberrant excision event is consistent with the observation that Str r progeny of SLJ5172B retained the GUS gene. This idea was also tested in experiments carried out on fully Str s progeny derived from RE,LE/SP7~transformants (see later discussion). DNA gel blot analysis was also performed on fully green SLJ4303A (sAc), SLJ5172 (sAc), and SLJ5172B (35S-JPASE) progeny using Sstl digestion and a Ds RE probe. This probedigest combination would also result in fragments of predictable sizes if the SIS mechanism occurred (Figure 5D). This analysis confirmed the results of the BstEII digests (data not shown).\n\nIn addition to the individuals shown in Figure 6, five independent SLJ5172A (355'TPASE) progeny and another six independent SLJ5172B (sAc) progeny were examined by DNA gel blot analysis with each of the four probe-digest combinations (data not shown). A total of 22 independent events were examined. In each case, the occurrence of a half Ds inversion was confirmed by the presence of the 3.4-kb, SP7-hybridizing EcoRI-Xbal band. Fourteen individuals fit the predictions of the SIS model in each of the probe-digest combinations. Four other individuals did not fulfill the predictions of the SIS model in the EcoRI-Xbal or EcoRI-Hindlll DNA gel blots but did have the predicted bands with BstEII and Sstl, which cut very close to the rearrangement breakpoint (Figure 6, lane 15, is an example). Four individuals did not fulfill the predictions of the SIS model in any of the probe-digest combinations examined (Figure 6, lanes 4 and 9, are examples). In total, 18 of the 22 events examined appeared to have resulted from the SIS mechanism.\n\nTobacco lines homozygous for the LE.RE/SP7 construct or the RE,LE/SP7construct (Figure 3) and carrying 35S:7P-4S£ were used to analyze rearrangements that resulted in marker gene loss upstream or downstream, respectively, from the Ds sequences. Each line was testcrossed to untransformed tobacco. Progeny were germinated on SCM and observed for SPT\" expression. In addition to somatic variegation, fully Str s seedlings were observed (Figure 4D). Fully Str s seedlings presumably arose due to germinally transmitted rearrangements. The frequencies with which fully Str s individuals were observed are listed in Table 1 (marker loss column).\n\nFully Str s seedlings were transferred to antibiotic-free medium and grown to maturity. DNA was then extracted, and DNA gel blot analysis was performed. To maximize the chances of ex-, amining genetically independent events, individuals from different seed capsules were used. Progeny were considered to be derived from independent events if they met the criteria stated earlier.\n\nTo test whether the SIS mechanism is involved with marker gene loss, Str s progeny from the LE.RE/SP7 line were examined. The T-DNA insertion of transformant LE.RE/SPTis shown in Figure 7A. In this diagram, SPTcorresponds to position Z in Figure 2E, and the T-DNA right border corresponds to position A in Figure 2E. The structure that might be present in Str s progeny if the SIS mechanism occurred, corresponding to the chromatid fusion structure shown in Figure 2G, is also represented. A 1.1-kb Sstl restriction fragment and a 7.1-kb EcoRI restriction fragment are predicted if the chromatids fuse by the SIS mechanism (Figure 7A). Again, the SIN mechanism would result in fragments of unpredictable lengths.\n\nDNA gel blot analysis showed that none of the Str s individuals had homology with SP7~or GUS (data not shown). Figure 7B shows Sstl-digested DNA from the LE,RE/SP7(35S:7fi4SE) parent (lane 1), and 13 Str s progeny hybridized with the Ds RE probe. Each of the Str s progeny had lost the 12-kb progenitor band, and nine individuals no longer had Ds sequences. The individuals represented in lanes 6 and 13 had the 1.1-kb band predicted by the SIS model. Lanes 3 and 11 have new bands of different lengths. A faint 1.1-kb band can be seen in lane 3 (asterisk). This could be explained if the Ds LE and RE in direct orientation remained intact after the rearrangement; the faint band could be due to somatic rearrangements because 35S-JPASE is present in this individual.\n\nDNA from the individuals with new Ds-hybridizing bands was analyzed using EcoRI digestion and the Ds RE probe (Figure 7C). The 7.1-kb EcoRI band predicted by the SIS mechanism was present in lanes 6, 11, and 13. The absence of the 1.1-kb Sstl band from lane 11 (Figure 7B) could be explained if a deletion around the junction point of the inversion removed the Sstl site that lies 26 bp from the predicted inversion junction. Lane 3 retains the 6.5-kb progenitor band (Figure 7C), suggesting that the Ds LE,RE was retained in this individual after the rearrangement. In three of four cases in which Dshybridizing sequences remained after marker loss, structures consistent with the occurrence of the SIS mechanism were detected.\n\nTo determine whether excised Ds ends reintegrate following aberrant excision events (as depicted in Figure 2H), Str s progeny from the RE.LE/SP7 line were examined. Figure 8A shows the RE.LE/SPTT-DNA insertion. In this case, SPT corresponds to position A in Figure 2E, and the T-DNA right border corresponds to position Z in Figure 2E. Thus, the chromatid fusion product (Figure 2G), containing SPT, was selected against in this experiment. If reintegration accompanies aberrant transpositions by the SIS mechanism, a Ds RE and/or a Ds RE,LE structure may be recovered (Figure 2H). The EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments corresponding to reinserted Ds RE or Ds RE.LE are shown in Figure 8A.\n\nA total of 11 independent Str s RE.LE/SP7 progeny were examined by DNA gel blot analysis. None of them had homology with SP7 or GUS, confirming that loss of SP7 resulted from DNA rearrangements (data not shown).

DNA Gel Blot Analysis of Rearrangements Accompanying Marker Loss from LE.RE/SPT Progeny. (A) Restriction map of the LE.RE/SPT T-DNA insertion and the rearrangement predicted by the SIS model. EcoRI (E) and Sstl (S) restriction sites are indicated. The T-DNA left border (LB) and right border (RB) are indicated. Predicted restriction fragments are shown. Arrowheads, stippled and striped boxes, NPT, SPT, and GUS are as given in the legend to Figure 3. For simplicity, only the marker gene coding sequences are shown. (B) Lane 1 contains DNA from the LE.RE/SP7 parent. Lanes 2 to 4 and 6 to 15 contain DNA from Str» testcross progeny from LE.RE/SPT: lane 2 to 4 and 6 to 9, capsule 1; lanes 10 to 12, capsule 2; lanes 11 to 13, capsule 3 (see Table 1). Lane 5 contains length markers (1-kb ladder; Bethesda Research Laboratories), with the 1.6-kb band hybridizing due to plasmid homology in the probe fragment preparation. Samples were digested with Sstl and hybridized with the Ds RE probe. The Ac TPASE band is indicated by an open arrowhead. The 12-kb progenitor band and the 1.1-kb band predicted by the SIS model are indicated. The dot marks the presence of a faint 1.1-kb band in lane 3. Ethidium bromide staining and reprobing with an Arabidopsis telomere probe (Richards and Ausubel, 1988) showed that each lane had similar amounts of DNA loaded (data not shown). (C) Numbers correspond to the same samples as given in (B). Each sample was digested with EcoRI and hybridized with the Ds RE probe. The Ac TPASE band is indicated by an open arrowhead. The 6.5-kb progenitor band and the 7.1-kb band predicted by the SIS model are indicated. with the Ds RE probe. The samples in lanes 2, 4, and 8 retained the 2.4-kb progenitor band, suggesting that Ds RE.LE reintegrated following the aberrant transposition event. Samples in lanes 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 have new bands (the new band in lane 5 comigrated with the 35S TPASE band), suggesting that Ds RE reintegrated in new positions. DMA gel blot analysis using EcoRI confirmed the results obtained with BamHI (data not shown). Reintegrated Ds ends were detected in each of the Str s RE,LE/SP7 progeny examined. In six individuals, Ds RE.LE was found (Figure 8B). In the remaining five individuals, Ds RE was found (Figure 8B  (B) Lane 1 contains DNA from the RE,LEJSPT parent. Lanes 2 to 10 contain DNA from Str s testcross progeny from transformant RE,LE/SP7, and the contents are as follows: lane 2, capsule 1; lanes 3 to 6, capsule 2; lanes 7 to 10, capsule 3 (see Table 1). Each sample was digested with BamHI and hybridized with the Ds RE probe. The Ac TPASE band is indicated by an open arrowhead. The 2.4-kb band corresponding to the intact Ds RE.LE structure is indicated.\n\nThe idea that Ds ends on sister Chromatids can participate in aberrant transposition events was proposed to explain the complicated insertions present in the maize sh-m:5933 and sh-m:6258 alleles (Fedoroff, 1989;D6ring et al., 1990). In our previous work (English et al., 1993), we extended this idea by proposing that an excision product might be formed by ligation of the sequences that had originally flanked the excised Ds ends. The sister Chromatids would be fused at this position, forming an acentric or dicentric chromatid, and chromosome breakage would result. Another consequence would be the inversion of a half Ds element. PCR experiments showed that the predicted half Ds inversions occurred in tobacco and maize, and the inversion junction points resembled Ac and Ds excision empty donor sites (English et al., 1993). These data are equally consistent with models for chromosome breakage in which Ds RE and LE on either single (SIN) or sister (SIS) chromatids are the substrate for an aberrant transposition event (Figure 2). Analysis of germinally transmitted rearrangements held the promise of distinguishing between these models. We presumed that the tetraploid nature of tobacco would enable plants that carried substantial rearrangements to be viable.\n\nIf each green Str r sector or individual arising from the \"inversion detection\" constructs (Figure 4, and Table 1, marker gain column) represents a half Ds inversion event, as implied by DNA gel blot analysis (Figure 6), half Ds inversions would occur frequently enough to play a role in chromosome breakage. However, several undetermined factors could affect the frequency of such green sectors. For example, the orientation of T-DNA insertions relative to the centromere is not known. The frequency with which half Ds inversions are recovered probably depends on whether they are carried on dicentric chromosomes or acentric fragments. If the inverted half Ds element were carried on a dicentric chromosome, the observed frequency of Str r material might be reduced if the resulting broken chromosomes were not fully viable. If the inverted half Ds element were carried on an acentric fragment, it might only be recovered if a reinsertion event within the acentric fragment \"rescued\" it (that is, if in Figure 5, the centromere is to the right and the excised Ds ends [Figure 5E] insert into the acentric fragment [Figure 5D]). Also, we do not know how stable the (presumably) grossly rearranged chromosomes that carry inverted half Ds elements might be. Thus, the frequency with which somatic and germinal Str r material are observed may be an underestimate of the frequency of half Ds inversions.\n\nDNA gel blot analysis of germinally transmitted inversion events showed that most resulted in products consistent with the SIS model for double Ds-induced chromosome breakage (Figure 6). Thus, the empty site sequences isolated by PCR experiments (English et al., 1993) probably represent the precise positions of sister chromatid fusion or \"chromatid fusion products.\" Other models explaining the structures that were observed would be complicated enough to make them unlikely.\n\nO f 22 germinally transmitted inversion events analyzed, only four did not fit the predictions of the SIS model. These conceivably could have also resulted from the SIS mechanism, followed by breakage of the resulting dicentric chromosome within the inverted half Os. Another possibility would be that a SIS-type event was followed by reinsertion of the excised Os ends (Figure 5E) into the inverted half Os (Figure 5D). For example, the bands in Figure 66 (lane 15) do not conform to the expected size (7.6 kb) of a half Os inversion product, but the 1.1-kb Sstl band in Figure 6C (lane 15; the same DNA sampie) does. This may mean that the complex of the Os LE and RE depicted in Figure 5E inserted into the DNA between the EcoRl and BstEll sites in Figure 5D. This structure was classified as resulting from the SIS mechanism. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some or all of the four exceptions result from the SIN model.\n\nHow could examples consistent with the SIN model as well as the SIS model be recovered? In \"normal\" transposition of a simple Os element, the Os element on only one of the two new chromatids after DNA replication would be activated for transposition, and the two ends of this element could become involved in a transposition complex due to their proximity on the same DNA strand. In the unusual circumstances of a half double Os, ends on different chromatids are activated for transposition. However, occasionally ends on the same chromatid may interact productively and result in events via the SIN mechanism, despite the fact that only one of these ends is activated for transposition. lrrespective of this possibility, the overwhelming majority of the events we analyzed are a consequence of aberrant transpositions involving Ds ends on sister chromatids. Although the SIS model was proposed some time ago, our data provide the only systematic and extensive examination of its validity.\n\nDNA gel blot analysis of 13 StrS LE,RE/SPT progeny showed that chromatid fusion products were present in three of the four individuals that retained Os-hybridizing sequences (Figures 76 and 7C). Thus, the SIS mechanism was involved with marker gene loss, as would be expected. In this experiment, there was no selection for retention of the chromatid fusion product. Therefore, the nine StrS LE,REISPT progeny that no longer had Os-hybridizing sequences may have received chromatid fusion products and then lost them by mitotic segregation of an acentric fragment (if the centromere were to the left in Figure 7A) or by subsequent breakage of a dicentric chromosome (if the centromere were to the right in Figure 7A). lmplicit in the SIS model is the association of transposition with DNA replication. Elegant genetic (Greenblatt, 1968(Greenblatt, ,1984) ) and molecular (Chen et al., 1987(Chen et al., , 1992) ) experiments have shown that Ac transposition from the maize P-Wallele follows DNA replication, resulting in the formation of twinned sectors following mitotic division (Greenblatt and Brink, 1962). Our observation that half double Ds-associated events usually fuse sister chromatids is consistent with previous findings that AdDs transposition is closely associated with DNA replication and that the Os or Ac on only one of two daughter chromatids is activated for transposition after DNA replication. Presumably, these observations are consequences of a common molecular mechanism that activates Os ends for transposition upon DNA replication.\n\nIt is intriguing that Os ends on sister chromatids are the preferred substrate for Ac TPASE when Os LE and RE are in direct orientation. To explain why this might be, and to explain why no more than one of the Ac elements on sister chromatids transposes after replication, Fedoroff (1989) proposed that a methylation-dependent strand asymmetry after DNA replication may control transposition. The Ac element that is hemimethylated on one strand would be activated for transposition, and the Ac element that is hemimethylated on the other strand would not. The presence of Os LE and RE in direct orientation, as in double Os, would mean that Os ends on sister chromatids would be activated for transposition. In vitro DNA binding studies with Ac TPASE support this idea (Kunze and Starlinger, 1989). Ac TPASE binds preferentially to DNA sequences carrying the hexamer motif AAACGG, which is present in multiple copies at both ends of Ac. This binding is influenced by methylation; fully methylated DNA and unmethylated DNA have a much lower affinity than hemimethylated DNA in which the hexamer sequence CCGTTT is modified to CmCmGTTT (where Cm represents methylated cytosine). Hemimethylated DNA in which the sequence AAA-CGG is modified to AAACmGG has a low affinity for TPASE (Kunze and Starlinger, 1989). It is known that asymmetric DNA hemimethylation influences transposition of bacterial transposon Tn70, causing it to be linked with DNA replication (Roberts et al., 1985); thus, there is a precedent for such a mechanism. The strength of the affinity between the TPASE protein and the Os LE and RE could be influenced by the number, accuracy, orientation, and spacing of the AAACGG motifs in each end (Figure 5; Kunze et al., 1989). It is not known exactly how the arrangement of these motifs renders LE and RE sufficiently distinct from each other after DNA replication to substantiallly alter their affinity for TPASE and to activate them as a substrate for transposition. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suppose that this arrangement provides a basis for coupling Os transposition to DNA replication.\n\nA possible argument against the involvement of hemimethylation comes from genomic sequencing of active Ac elements in transgenic tobacco (Ott et al., 1992). No evidence was found for methylation of cytosine residues on either strand of an 4 5 0bp segment near the 5' end, although methylation of 10% or less of the residues at any given position would not have been detected.\n\nThe maize sh-m:5933 allele may have resulted from an aberrant transposition by the SIS mechanism in which the Os RE and LE (originally on sister chromatids) inserted into the shrunken gene (Fedoroff, 1989). This interpretation implies that Ds ends originating on sister chromatids can reintegrate following an aberrant transposition event. However, only one other allele with a similar structure has been described (sh-m:6258; Doring et al., 1990), so the generality of such events in maize is not known.\n\nIn our experiments, the detection of Os-hybridizing sequences, in addition to those corresponding to the chromatid fusion product in individuals that received a germinally activated SPT gene (Figure 6C), suggested that reinsertion may be part of the SIS mechanism (that is, the excised Os ends, represented in Figure 5E, may reinsert). This idea was confirmed in our analysis of rearrangements involving the RE,LEI SPT structure in which a reinserted Os end was recovered in every case examined (Figure 8 and data not shown). However, two reinserted Os ends were never recovered in the same plant.\n\nReinsertion of the excised Os ends probably explains why 51726 Strr progeny retained GUS activity.\n\nThe recovery of either the Os RE or Os RE,LE after aberrant transpositions involving half double Os (Figure 8) suggests that even though they originate on sister chromatids, the excised Os RE and Os LE are held together in a complex by transposase prior to insertion of both ends into a new location. Biochemical analysis will be required to test whether such a complex exists. However, a genetic prediction is that during SIS rearrangements of a half double Os (Figure 2H), the Os LE and Os LE,RE would reintegrate at the same position prior to mitotic segregation and create identical 8bp direct repeats.\n\nIn the experiments reported here, it was not possible to mark two halves of a twin sector from which DNA might be made to test this idea, but this may be feasible in future experiments.\n\nFrom in vitro analysis of phage Mu and Tn70 transposition, evidente has emerged for an intermediate termed the cleaved donor complex, consisting of transposon ends bound to transposase and separated (on one or both strands) from their previous integration site (Mizuuchi, 1992). This structure gives rise to a strand transfer complex with target DNA sequences and leads to transposition (Mizuuchi, 1992).\n\nCould Ac transposition work in a similar manner? Observations in tobacco and maize suggest that Os ends, in half double Os structures, participate in \"excisions\" leading to chromatid fusion and that they then reinsert at new locations. The appearance of such \"reinsertion\" events is consistent with the idea that even Os ends on sister chromatids can be \"excised,\" associate into a cleaved donor complex, and then form a strand transfer complex with target DNA. The resulting structures could be viable or could be lost by mitotic segregation (if acentric), by a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle (if dicentric), or maintained (if selected using the appropriate genetic markers). This interpretation of our data extends an emerging view that transposition in many different systems operates through extremely similar fundamental mechanisms (Mizuuchi, 1992).\n\nRecombinant plasmids were constructed by standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989). Full details of constructions will be supplied upon request. pSLJ4303 was based on pJJ4048 (Jones et al., 1992), a binary vector carrying a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (Gritz and Davies, 1983) under the control of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens 1' promoter (Velten et al., 1984) and a promoterless streptomycin phosphotransferase (SPT) gene (Maliga et al., 1988;Jones et al., 1989).\n\nA bglucuronidase (GUS) coding sequence (Jefferson et al., 1987) and Agrobacterium nopaline synthase 3'end (Depicker et al., 1982) were inserted downstream of an Agrobacterium 2' promoter (Velten et al., 1984) as a 2-kb Clal fragment. A phosphinothricin acetyltransferase coding sequence and 3'end (DeBlock et al., 1987) were inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35s promoter as a 2-kb Hindlll-Xhol fragment. An invemion detection Dissociation (Ds) element (pSW4251) was derived from pSW1324 by inserting a CaMV 35s promoter in the Ds right end. This inversion detection Ds element was inserted adjacent to the promoterless SPT gene to yield pSW4303. pSW5172 was derived from pJJ4048 by inserting a GUS coding sequence and nopaline synthase 3'end downstream of the 35s promoter as a 2-kb Hindlll-Xhol fragment and inserting the inversion detection Ds element adjacent to the promoterless SPT gene.\n\nAll transformations were performed with the streptomycin-sensitive (Strs) tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cultivar Petite Havana. Binary T-DNA constructs were mobilized into Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 (Hoekema et al., 1983). Transgenic tobacco plants were regenerated as described by Horsch et al. (1985). lndependent transformed lines were named according to the T-DNA construct that they received, followed by a letter in cases in which multiple transformants had the same T-DNA construct (for example, SLJ5172A, SW5172B).\n\nTransgenic seed was germinated on medium consisting of Murashige and Skoog medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA), 0.6% agarose with 1% glucose, and 300 mglL streptomycin (Maliga et al.,  1988; Jones et al., 1989). Variegation was visualized 10 to 14 days after planting of seed.\n\nLarge-scale DNA preparations and DNA gel blot analysis were performed as described previously (English et al., 1993)."
