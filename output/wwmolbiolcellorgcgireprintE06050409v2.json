    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the chromosomal passenger complex is well known to regulate kinetochore behaviour in mitosis, no functional link has yet been established between the complex and kinetochore structure. In addition, remarkably little is known about how the complex targets to centromeres. Here, in a study of caspase-8 activation during death receptor-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we have found that cleaved caspase-8 rapidly translocates to the nucleus and that this is correlated with loss of the centromeric protein, CENP-C, resulting in extensive disruption of centromeres.\nCaspase-8 activates cytoplasmic caspase-7, which is likely to be the primary caspase responsible for cleavage of CENP-C and INCENP, a key chromosomal passenger protein. Caspase-mediated cleavage of CENP-C and INCENP results in their mislocalization and the subsequent mislocalization of Aurora B kinase. Our results demonstrate that the chromosomal passenger complex is displaced from centromeres as a result of caspase activation. Furthermore, mutation of the primary caspase cleavage sites of INCENP and CENP-C and expression of non-cleavable CENP-C or INCENP prevents the mislocalization of the passenger complex following caspase activation. Our studies provide the first evidence for a functional interplay between the passenger complex and CENP-C.",
    "full_text": "The kinetochore directs the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division. This structure is highly complex, with 60 or more components identified to date in the relatively simple budding yeast centromere (Cheeseman et al., 2002b;Kline-Smith et al., 2005). The first centromeric proteins were identified using autoimmune sera, and were designated centromere proteins (CENPs) A -C (Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985).\n\nCENP-A is a histone H3 variant (Palmer et al., 1991;Sullivan et al., 1994) that is an essential component at or near the head of the pathway of centromere assembly (Oegema et al., 2001). CENP-B binds to a specific sequence in the alpha-satellite DNA throughout the centromeric heterochromatin below the kinetochore plate, but is of unknown function (Masumoto et al., 1989;Cooke et al., 1990). CENP-C, a DNAbinding protein concentrated in the inner kinetochore plate, is downstream of CENP-A, but required for the assembly of most other kinetochore components (Saitoh et al., 1992;Cleveland et al., 2003;Maiato et al., 2004). Although generally studied in the context of mitotic kinetochore function, CENP-A and CENP-C have been shown to be marked for destruction during interphase by the Herpes simplex ICP0 protein (Everett et al., 1999;Lomonte et al., 2001). This cleavage of centromeric components triggers the recently discovered interphase centromere damage response, which involves the functional reorganisation of Cajal Bodies and GEMs (P. Lomonte, personal communication).\n\nThe chromosomal passenger complex, which includes INCENP, Aurora B, survivin and borealin/Dasra B is a key regulator of mitotic events (Cooke et al., 1987;Uren et al., 2000;Gassmann et al., 2004;Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004). The active agent in this complex, Aurora B kinase (Adams et al., 2000), is required for the final stages of chromosome condensation, for chromosomes to achieve a proper bipolar attachment to the spindle, for the function of the spindle assembly checkpoint that monitors this bipolar attachment, and ultimately for the successful completion of cytokinesis (Adams et al., 2001;Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003;Honda et al., 2003;Gassmann et al., 2004;Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004). Aurora B phosphorylates numerous chromosomal substrates, including histone H3 (Hsu et al., 2000;Murnion et al., 2001), CENP-A (Zeitlin et al., 2001b), the regulator of centromeric cohesion MEI-S332 (Resnick et al., 2006), the mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) (Andrews et al., 2004;Lan et al., 2004) and Hec1/Ndc80, a kinetochore component essential for microtubule binding (Cheeseman et al., 2006;DeLuca et al., 2006). Phosphorylation of Hec1/Ndc80 is essential for the correction of attachment errors during mitosis.\n\nRecent results reveal that INCENP is a nexus for mitotic kinase signalling, as in addition to its binding of Aurora B, it also binds to Plk1 and directs the targeting of this essential kinase to kinetochores (Goto et al., 2005;Carmena and Earnshaw, 2006).\n\nDespite its demonstrated role in regulation of kinetochore attachment to microtubules (Tanaka et al., 2002), RNAi studies suggested that targeting of kinetochore components such as CENP-A and the chromosomal passenger proteins were not functionally linked (Oegema et al., 2001), and little is known about how the passengers are targeted to centromeres (Vader et al., 2006).\n\nApoptosis is a major form of cell death, used to remove unwanted or excess cells.\n\nTwo predominant pathways of apoptosis have been described, the intrinsic pathway involving initial mitochondrial perturbation resulting from cellular stress or cytotoxic insults and the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by activation of death receptors of the TNF family (Earnshaw et al., 1999;Bratton et al., 2000). Caspase-8 and -9 are the apical caspases in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, respectively and they activate the effector caspases, -3, -6 and -7, which cleave many cellular substrates resulting in the characteristic morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis (Earnshaw et al., 1999;Sun et al., 1999). Ligation of the death receptors, such as CD95 (Fas/Apo1), TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, by their cognate ligands or agonistic antibodies results in receptor aggregation and recruitment of the adaptor protein MORT1/FADD (Fasassociated death domain) (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998;Wallach et al., 1999). FADD then recruits the initiator caspase-8, which is activated within the death-inducing signalling complex (reviewed in (Peter and Krammer, 2003)). However recent studies have shown that caspase-8 and FADD are not recruited to a TNF-induced membrane-bound receptor signalling complex but instead are activated elsewhere within the cell (Harper et al., 2003;Micheau and Tschopp, 2003).\n\nThe present study was instigated to ascertain where caspase-8 is activated following TNF stimulation. Surprisingly in response to TNF or TRAIL, we observed an early localization of active caspase-8 in the nucleus accompanied by a loss of CENP-C and INCENP. Mapping of the cleavage sites and construction of non-cleavable mutants have revealed for the first time that localization of the chromosomal passenger complex to kinetochores requires intact CENP-C, whilst conversely, localization of CENP-C to kinetochores requires intact INCENP. This is the first demonstration of a functional interplay between the chromosomal passenger complex and an integral kinetochore component.\n\nMedia and serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. The caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.fmk) was from Enzyme Systems Inc. [ 35 S]-Methionine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK.\n\nRecombinant TRAIL and active caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8 were prepared as described (MacFarlane et al., 1997;Sun et al., 2004) and caspase activity was determined by active site titration with z-VAD.fmk (Stennicke and Salvesen, 1999). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. were plated on coverslips in 12 well plates and transiently transfected with FuGENE TM 6 (Boehringer Mannheim). After 24 h, cells were exposed to various apoptotic stimuli as described. Cells were synchronized using thymidine and nocodazole as described in figure legends.\n\nThe following antibodies were used for Western blotting and/or immunofluorescence -cleaved caspase-8 (Cell Signalling Technology); Anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Ser 10) (Upstate Biotechnology); Aurora B and caspase-6 (BD Transduction Laboratories and Abcam); HA-tag (Roche); BubR1 antibody (Ditchfield et al., 2003) was provided by Dr. S. Taylor (University of Manchester, UK); c-myc antibody (Cell Signalling Technology) and CENP-C, INCENP, Survivin and Borealin (Saitoh et al., 1992;Adams et al., 2001;Ditchfield et al., 2003). The following antibodies were used for Western blotting -T7 (Merck Biosciences); anti-CENP-C provided by Professor K.\n\nYoda (Nagoy University, Japan) (Ando et al., 2002) and caspase-7 and -8 antibodies that recognize the intact zymogen and the processed forms (Sun et al., 1999). The CENP-A antibody for immunofluorescence was provided by Dr. M. Valdivia, (University of Cádiz, Spain) (Valdivia et al., 1998). Anti-centromere (ACA), anti-CENP-B and PIKA antibodies were used for immunofluorescence (Saunders et al., 1991;Saitoh et al., 1992).\n\nCells were grown on coverslips and following treatment were washed with PBS, fixed using 3.8% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed in PBS and permeablized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in 3% BSA for 5 min. After rinsing in PBS, blocking with 3% BSA for 30 min and rewashing in PBS, the cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 60 min with anti-Alexa fluor ® 568 and or 488 antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in 3% BSA. Following washing with PBS, the nuclei were stained by incubating the cells for 10 min with Hoechst 33258 (250 ng ml -1 ) (Calbiochem) at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS then mounted onto slides using vectashield® (Vector Laboratories). Optical sections were taken using an argon-krypton laser and either a Leica TCS-4D or Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert 200 confocal imaging system. Microscopes were equipped with either a 63 x NA 1.4 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) or a 100 x NA 1.4 -0.7 (Leica) oil immersion objectives and standard filter sets. Images were cropped in Adobe photoshop 5.5 and were sized and placed using Adobe Illustrator CS2. The cell counts represent the median of at least three separate experiments in which at least 500 (Figs. 234) or 100  were counted per treatment per experiment.\n\nProtein samples obtained from equal numbers of cells or nuclei were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels appropriate to the molecular weight of the protein of interest, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra; Amersham) and detection as previously described (Sun et al., 1999;Sun et al., 2004).\n\nMCF-7 cells were resuspended to a concentration of 10,000 cells/well in 12 well plates and transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 100 nM using Effectene (Qiagen). After 24 h, cells were retransfected and 24 h later, exposed to apoptotic stimuli and processed for SDS-PAGE analysis or immunofluorescence.\n\nCaspase-7 oligonucleotides were from Ambion (Silencer TM Pre-designed siRNAs) and XIAP and scrambled oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon.\n\nFull length CENP-C (residues 1-943) (Pluta and Earnshaw, 1996;Yang et al., 1996) was subcloned into pET21b (Novagen) and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) in frame with the C-terminal c-myc tag and full length INCENP (Honda et al., 2003) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 HA tag in frame with the C-terminal HA tag using standard PCR based subcloning techniques. Mutant CENP-C (D624A) and INCENP (D438A) were generated using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA).\n\n[ 35 S]-labelled proteins were produced using the TNT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, WI). Customer designed PCR primers were from Invitrogen.\n\nCells were trypsinized and washed once in cold PBS and once in nuclei preparation buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.4, 0.15 mM spermine and 0.5 mM spermidine, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were resuspended in this buffer containing 0.1 % digitonin, kept on ice for 30 min and then passed through a 25G needle 20 times prior to centrifugation at 2,000 rpm at 4°C for 3 min. The resultant nuclei were washed three times with the nuclei preparation buffer (without digitonin). Nuclear preparations (2x10 6 ml -1 ) were treated with caspases for 60 min and the reactions terminated with equal volumes of 2x SDS loading buffer. Samples for immunofluorescence were removed prior to the addition of SDS buffer and centrifuged onto glass slides (600 rpm, 5 min).\n\nNon-parametric methods were used to analyze the data sets. For comparison of two treatment groups, Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test was used. The Kruskal Wallis one way ANOVA test was used for comparison of three or more treatment groups. Dunn's test was then used for post hoc comparison between groups (Siegal and Castellan, 1988). Analysis of the data was one tailed as only decrease in the experimental outcomes/measures was possible. Spearman's Rank test was used for testing correlation. A significance level of p<0.05 was employed except in the figures where * = <0.05, ** = <0.01 and *** = <0.001.\n\nProcessed caspase-8 is found in the nucleus shortly after death receptor stimulation.\n\nIn order to ascertain where caspase-8 is activated in TNF-induced apoptosis, we used a monoclonal antibody that detects the fully processed p10 subunit of caspase-8 resulting from cleavage at Asp 384, which throughout this study we will refer to as cleaved caspase-8. Using this antibody, we detected discrete punctate foci of 0.3-0.5 μm within the nuclei of MCF-7 cells within 30 min of exposure to TNF/cycloheximide (Figure 1A) whereas no such labelling was observed in untreated cells (Figure 1A). Similar activation occurred with TRAIL, another TNF family member, when cleaved caspase-8 appeared within the nucleus of some cells as early as 5 min post treatment (Figure 1A) and was retained in the nucleus up to 30 min. At later times (60 min), cleaved caspase-8 was also seen in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A).\n\nThe appearance of cleaved caspase-8 in the nucleus at 5 min detected by confocal microscopy preceded the detection of processed caspase-8 (15 min) by western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\nTo determine if cleaved caspase-8 accumulated in the nuclei of cells other than MCF-7 cells, which are deficient in caspase-3 (Janicke et al., 1998), HeLa and A549 cells were exposed to TRAIL. Cleaved caspase-8 was initially observed in the nucleus and appeared in the cytoplasm at later times in both cell lines (Figure 1B). Nuclear cleaved caspase-8 was also present in wild type Jurkat cells exposed to TRAIL but was absent in caspase-8 deficient, FADD deficient and c-FLIP s over expressing Jurkat cells (Figure 1C). These results further support the specificity of the nuclear caspase-8 labelling. Induction of apoptosis by TRAIL resulted in a time-dependent processing of caspase-8 initially to its p43 and p41 processed forms in wild type but not in FADD deficient or c-FLIP s over-expressing Jurkat cells (Figure 1D, upper three boxes).\n\nUsing the same neoepitope antibody as in the immunofluorescence studies, a time dependent appearance of the p10 catalytically active small subunit of caspase-8 was also detected following exposure to TRAIL (Figure 1D, lowest box). The appearance of cleaved caspase-8 within the nucleus following induction of apoptosis raised the possibility that caspase-8 was already present within the nucleus prior to TRAIL treatment, as recently proposed (Besnault-Mascard et al., 2005). However using confocal microscopy, cell fractionation and western blotting, we have been unable to demonstrate the presence of either unprocessed or sumolyated caspase-8 within the nucleus (unpublished data). The failure to detect nuclear cleaved caspase-8 by western blot analysis at early times following TRAIL treatment could be due both to the lower sensitivity of the method compared to confocal analysis and also to the possible leakage of the cleaved caspase from the nuclei following isolation, given the known alterations in the nuclear transport systems early in apoptosis (Ferrando-May, 2005).\n\nTherefore cleaved caspase-8 may be transported to the nucleus following its formation within the cytosol. In support of this, active caspase-8, added to permeabilised MCF-7 cells, was transported into the nucleus and this transport was blocked by pre-treatment with WGA (Supplementary Figure 2), which inhibits NLSmediated nuclear transport (Newmeyer and Forbes, 1988). Taken together these data demonstrate for the first time the rapid appearance of cleaved caspase-8 within the nuclei of various cell types following death receptor stimulation.\n\nA striking time dependent loss of CENP-C labelling was observed in TRAIL-treated cells that contained nuclear cleaved caspase-8, whereas normal centromeric labelling of CENP-C was retained in cells lacking nuclear cleaved caspase-8 (Figure 2A-C).\n\nAfter 30 min exposure, nuclei containing both cleaved caspase-8 and CENP-C were observed, although the CENP-C labelling was clearly diminished compared to cells not containing cleaved caspase-8 (Figure 2B). After 1 h exposure to TRAIL, cells with nuclear cleaved caspase-8 lost all detectable CENP-C labelling (Figure 2C). Pretreatment with z-VAD.fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, prevented the appearance of cleaved caspase-8 and the loss of CENP-C labelling (Figure 2D), supporting the suggestion that cleaved caspase-8 within the nucleus led either directly or indirectly to the loss of CENP-C labelling. Loss of CENP-C was also observed following TRAIL treatment of Jurkat and A549 cells showing that this loss is not cell type specific (Figure 2E and L). To confirm that the TRAIL-induced loss of CENP-C was not due to a specific property of the antibody used (Ab 554), two additional CENP-C antibodies were used. Loss of CENP-C was again observed (Figure 2 F and G and data not shown). No co-localization of cleaved caspase-8 was observed with centromeres, PML or PIKA bodies, following exposure to TRAIL for 1 h (Supplementary Figure 3) (Saunders et al., 1991;Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998;Platani and Lamond, 2004), however, any association of a caspase with its substrate would probably be transient.\n\nTo determine if caspase activation also resulted in loss of other centromeric proteins, we used anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), which detect CENP-A, B and C, as well as anti-CENP-A and anti-CENP-B antibodies. A clear diminution in ACA staining was observed in cells containing nuclear cleaved caspase-8, which was also prevented by z-VAD.fmk (Figure 2H-J), confirming the caspase-dependent change in centromeric structure. MCF-7 cells showed a marked time-dependent loss of CENP-C labelling with a significant decrease in median values at 2 and 3 h following exposure to TRAIL, which preceded and was more extensive than the loss of CENP-A staining (Figure 2K). We were unable to assess the effects of TRAIL on CENP-B in MCF-7 cells, as the antibody did not uniformly label untreated cells. However in A549 cells, where this was not a problem, extensive loss of CENP-C was again observed following TRAIL treatment without significant loss of CENP-B (Figure 2L). Thus our data suggest an early relatively selective loss of CENP-C from the centromeres, which precedes a more general disruption of kinetochore chromatin with loss of CENP-A.\n\nOur results suggested that caspase-8 could be directly or indirectly responsible for the cleavage and resultant loss of CENP-C from the centromeres. As direct cleavage of CENP-C by caspase-8 was the simplest hypothesis, we generated full length [ 35 S]labelled CENP-C protein by in vitro translation (IVT) and exposed it to active recombinant caspases. High concentrations of caspase-8 were required to cleave CENP-C (Figure 3A) suggesting that caspase-8 may promote CENP-C cleavage by activating another caspase. To test this hypothesis, CENP-C was exposed to caspase-6 and -7, the major effector caspases in MCF-7 cells as well as active caspase-3, used as a positive control. All the caspases cleaved CENP-C in a concentration dependent manner albeit with differing efficiencies (Figure 3A). Caspase-7 was clearly the most efficacious with low concentrations (1 -3 nM) resulting in efficient cleavage of CENP-C to an ~80 kDa fragment and higher concentrations resulting in complete loss of the full-length protein with formation of multiple cleavage products (Figure 3A).\n\nAs these results were obtained solely with in vitro recombinant proteins, we examined if CENP-C cleavage also occurred in intact cells. In MCF-7 cells exposed to TRAIL, little if any cleavage of CENP-C was observed by Western blot analysis, possibly because of the very low abundance of this protein and/or its degradation by the proteasome (Everett et al., 1999). To facilitate study of endogenous CENP-C, isolated nuclei were incubated with recombinant caspases. Caspase-7 (10 nM) and caspase-3 (50 nM) again cleaved endogenous CENP-C to an ~80 kDa fragment, whereas caspase-6 and -8 (200 nM) failed to cleave CENP-C in isolated nuclei (Figure 3B).\n\nUsing confocal microscopy, loss of kinetochore-associated CENP-C was observed in nuclei exposed to active caspase-7 (10 and 200 nM) as well as caspase-3 (200 nM) but not caspase-6 or -8 (200 nM) (Figure 3C -H). These results are consistent with specific disruption of centromeres by active caspases, in particular by caspase-7 and caspase-3 with the former being ~5-10 fold more efficient at cleaving CENP-C.\n\nThese results suggested that caspase-7, rather than caspase-8, might be the primary caspase responsible for CENP-C cleavage. To test this hypothesis, staurosporine was used to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as this should result in activation of the intrinsic pathway with initial activation of caspase-9, which can then subsequently activate caspase-7 (Slee et al., 1999;Bratton et al., 2001). Caspase-8 should not be activated in this model system as caspase-3 is required for activation of caspase-8 via caspase-6 downstream of mitochondria (Slee et al., 1999). In support of this prediction, caspase-7 was processed to its catalytically active p19 large subunit without any detectable cleavage/processing of caspase-8 in staurosporine treated MCF-7 cells (Figure 3I). Staurosporine induced a highly significant time dependent loss of cells labelled with CENP-C (Figure 3J) further supporting an active role for caspase-7 rather than caspase-8 in CENP-C cleavage. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with z-VAD.fmk (50 μM), prevented the staurosporine-induced loss of CENP-C labelling supporting the suggestion the loss of CENP-C labelling was due to caspase activation rather than inhibition of protein kinases (Supplementary Figure 4). To further assess the role of caspase-7 in CENP-C cleavage in MCF-7 cells, we depleted caspase-7 using siRNA. Extensive knockdown of endogenous caspase-7 (75-90 %) was observed without any depletion of caspase-8 or -6 (Supplementary Figure 5A). Knockdown of caspase-7 in Bcl-x L over-expressing MCF-7 cells resulted in a significant inhibition of the loss of CENP-C labelled cells following exposure to TRAIL (Supplementary Figure 5B), further supporting an important role for caspase-7 in mediating CENP-C loss, at least in MCF-7 cells.\n\nThe activity of the kinetochore in both microtubule transactions and cell cycle signalling is regulated by protein kinases, including Bub1, BubR1 and the chromosomal passenger complex (Cleveland et al., 2003;Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004). In preliminary experiments, no change was observed in BubR1 associated with the kinetochore in TRAIL-treated cells (unpublished data). However, TRAIL treatment had a profound effect on the localization of the chromosomal passenger proteins. In control HeLa cells at G2, Aurora B was present in the nucleus and highly concentrated at the centromeres, as shown by its partial co-localization with both CENP-C and CENP-A (Figures 4A and B). Following exposure to TRAIL, Aurora B no longer localized to centromeres (Figure 4D and E). Strikingly all cells that had lost CENP-C failed to concentrate Aurora B at the centromeres (Figure 4J). In untreated cells Aurora B largely co-localized with Borealin (Figure 4C). Following exposure to TRAIL, Borealin also exhibited a diffuse nuclear staining and was no longer concentrated at the centromeres (Figure 4F). These data reveal that loss of CENP-C correlates with the mislocalization of chromosomal passenger proteins during interphase.\n\nSurprisingly, CENP-C cleavage is required for TRAIL-induced mislocalization of chromosomal passenger proteins. Site directed mutagenesis revealed DEAD 624 ↓L as the primary caspase-7-cleavage site in CENP-C (Figure 4G). This D(I)XAD motif is conserved in mouse, rat and human. Transfected wild type and non-cleavable CENP-C localized adjacent to Aurora B, showing a normal centromeric distribution (Figure 4H and I). Furthermore, transfection of the non-cleavable but not the wild type CENP-C prevented the mislocalization of Aurora B compared to control GFP transfected cells following exposure to TRAIL (Figure 4K). The ability of noncleavable CENP-C to block Aurora B mislocalization was surprising as CENP-C and the passenger proteins have been shown to target to centromeres independently of one another (Oegema et al., 2001).\n\nDisruption of any one of the chromosomal passenger components prevents localization of the entire complex to centromeres (Adams et al., 2001;Honda et al., 2003;Gassmann et al., 2004). We wished to determine whether mislocalization of Aurora B following exposure to TRAIL (Figure 4) was due solely to cleavage of CENP-C or might be also due to cleavage of chromosomal passenger proteins.\n\nAnalysis of synchronized MCF-7 cells in G2 exposed to TRAIL revealed that INCENP but not Aurora B, survivin or Borealin was cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (Figure 5A). Thus, INCENP cleavage could explain the mislocalization of Aurora B in these cells. [ 35 S]-labelled INCENP was cleaved by caspase-3, -7 and -8 into two fragments of ~65 kDa with caspase-7 again being the most effective (Figure 5B). Site directed mutagenesis revealed DQAD 438 ↓G as the primary caspase-7cleavage site in INCENP (Figure 5C). This DQXD↓G motif is conserved in human,\n\nOur results demonstrating that expression of non-cleavable CENP-C or INCENP prevented the mislocalization of the passenger complex following caspase activation were surprising, as they suggested a previously unknown functional dependency between the passenger complex and CENP-C. To investigate this potential interaction, we expressed both wild type and non-cleavable INCENP and examined their effects\n\nExperiments performed in yeasts and vertebrate cells have revealed an important functional link between the chromosomal passenger proteins and kinetochores during mitosis. However neither kinetochores nor the passenger proteins are known to have a function, either jointly or separately, during interphase. The present study reveals that, surprisingly, there is a functional link between kinetochores and the chromosomal passengers during interphase by showing that interfering with caspasemediated cleavage of either can influence the localization of the other.\n\nDuring mitosis, the passenger complex is essential for error correction at kinetochores: when passenger proteins are inactivated by mutation, depletion, or chemical inhibitors, cells undergo a striking increase in the number of syntelic and merotelic kinetochore attachment errors. In budding yeast, the kinetochore protein Dam1p is phosphorylated by the Aurora kinase Ipl1p and this is important for the correction of attachment errors (Cheeseman et al., 2002a). In vertebrates, microtubule binding by the kinetochore involves the Ncd80 complex, one of whose four components, Hec1/Ndc80 is phosphorylated by Aurora B (Cheeseman et al., 2006;DeLuca et al., 2006). Aurora B phosphorylation weakens the affinity of Hec1/Ndc80 for microtubules (Cheeseman et al., 2006) and is essential for error correction during mitosis (DeLuca et al., 2006). Action of Aurora B on MCAK or ICIS may also have a role in error correction during mitosis (Ohi et al., 2003;Andrews et al., 2004;Lan et al., 2004). Thus, the role of the chromosomal passenger complex in regulating kinetochore function in mitosis is beginning to be understood in some detail. In contrast, next to nothing is known about the role, if any, of centromeres or the passenger proteins during interphase.\n\nAt early times following TRAIL or TNF stimulation, active caspase-8 is detected in nuclear foci. In those cells, CENP-C was cleaved by caspases at the sequence DEAD↓L. INCENP was also cleaved and the chromosomal passenger complex was delocalized. Cleavage of CENP-A, CENP-B, Aurora B, survivin or borealin/Dasra B was not detected. Although the caspase responsible for CENP-C cleavage in vivo could not be identified unequivocally, a variety of evidence suggested that caspase-7 was responsible and a knockdown of caspase-7 protected against the loss of CENP-C in TRAIL-treated MCF-7 cells. It is worth noting that following DNA damage, caspase-7 is the major caspase responsible for the cleavage of Claspin and the resulting inactivation of the Chk1 signalling pathway (Clarke et al., 2005). However, most of our studies were carried out in MCF-7 cells, which are deficient in caspase-3.\n\nTherefore we cannot exclude an additional role for caspase-3 in the cleavage of CENP-C and INCENP in other cell types where caspase-3 may be the major effector caspase.\n\nThe known interactions between chromosomal passengers and kinetochore proteins all occur during mitosis, whereas the cleavage of CENP-C and INCENP described here following TNF-R or TRAIL ligation, occurs during interphase. Until very recently, centromeres had not been known to have any activities or functions during interphase. However, it has been recently discovered that the cleavage of centromeric components induced by Herpes simplex virus ICP0 (Everett et al., 1999;Lomonte et al., 2001) induces an interphase centromere damage response, which involves the functional reorganization of Cajal Bodies and GEMs (P. Lomonte, personal communication). Although the consequences of this response are yet to be determined, such a reorganisation within the nucleus could have functional consequences, including alterations in RNA processing and gene expression. Thus, it appears that centromeres and their associated chromosomal passenger complex may have a previously unrecognised role in the interphase nucleus, much as the condensin complex has recently been shown to also have a function in DNA repair (Heale et al., 2006).\n\nWe have also considered other possible consequences of caspase cleavage of centromere components during interphase. Caspase-7 mediated cleavage of INCENP at Asp 438 produces two fragments of ~65 kDa. The C-terminal fragment contains the highly conserved IN-box (Adams et al., 2001), which is responsible for binding and activation of Aurora B (Bishop and Schumacher, 2002;Honda et al., 2003), but lacks amino-terminal motifs required for targeting INCENP to centromeres during mitosis (Ainsztein et al., 1998). Thus, caspase cleavage could lead to production of a deregulated kinase that might promote the cell death response, as has been shown for caspase cleavage of a number of other protein kinases, including PKC isoforms, MEKK1, PAK2 and Mst1 (Earnshaw et al., 1999;Cheung et al., 2003).\n\nAlthough the present studies have focused on events during interphase, it is also possible that the cleavage of CENP-C and INCENP described here is part of a mechanism to enforce the cell death decision by ensuring the failure of mitosis. For example, the destruction of CENP-C and CENP-A caused by Herpes simplex ICP0 leads to a dramatic disruption of mitotic events (Everett et al., 1999;Lomonte et al., 2001). In addition, BubR1 is cleaved by caspases during extended checkpoint arrest in HeLa cells, and this abrogates the checkpoint response, leading to an aberrant mitotic exit (Kim et al., 2005). Mutation of the caspase cleavage sites in BubR1 appeared to reinforce the spindle checkpoint and also protected cells against apoptosis (Kim et al., 2005). Interestingly, cleavage of INCENP and the resulting disruption of the chromosomal passenger complex would also be expected to interfere with the checkpoint response as Survivin and Aurora B are required for stable checkpoint activation in response to the lack of spindle tension (Carvalho et al., 2003;Ditchfield et al., 2003;Hauf et al., 2003;Lens et al., 2003).\n\nThe N-terminus of INCENP is sufficient for targeting of the protein to centromeres, possibly through interactions with borealin and survivin (Ainsztein et al., 1998;Gassmann et al., 2004;Vader et al., 2006). However, the chromosomal receptor for the passenger complex remains unknown. Although CENP-A phosphorylation was implicated in the timely release of the INCENP and Aurora B from anaphase kinetochores (Zeitlin et al., 2001a), the targeting and stability of kinetochore and chromosomal passenger proteins at centromeres were thought to be independent events. For example, RNAi depletion of CENP-A in C. elegans had no effect on INCENP localization to centromeres and vice versa (Oegema et al., 2001). This was consistent with immunoelectron microscopy results, which revealed INCENP to be concentrated in the heterochromatin beneath the kinetochore (Cooke et al., 1987), whilst CENP-A is located in the inner kinetochore plate (C.A. Cooke & WCE, unpublished). Why previous studies had failed to detect this dependency is not clear. The most obvious possibility is that additional components of the centromere are cleaved by caspases in our experiments, and that this is required for loss of the passenger proteins from centromeres. If so, then it must be true that either the cleavage of those hypothetical proteins or the loss of the passenger proteins requires cleavage of CENP-C. Alternatively, it is possible that low levels of residual kinetochore proteins remaining in RNAi studies might suffice for passenger targeting to centromeres, and that CENP-C destruction by caspase-7 might simply be more efficient than RNAi.\n\nFinally, it is possible that the gradual depletion of kinetochore components that follows upon destruction of their mRNAs might allow cells sufficient time to adapt and up-regulate alternative pathways to influence chromosomal passenger localization, whereas the rapid cleavage that occurs during apoptosis does not.\n\nIn summary, following the induction of death receptor-mediated apoptosis, we have shown a very rapid appearance of active caspases within the nucleus that brings about the cleavage and loss of CENP-C and INCENP and the mislocalization of the other chromosomal passenger proteins. In the future, it will be important to determine whether this is part of the newly discovered interphase centromere damage response (P. Lomonte, personal communication), and if so what the functional consequences of this response are for cell growth and survival. Figure 1. Rapid translocation of cleaved caspase-8 to the nucleus in death receptor induced apoptosis. In (A-C), cells were stained with anti-cleaved caspase-8 (green) and Hoechst 33258 (blue) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. (A) MCF-7 cells\n\nwere incubated either alone, with recombinant TNF (400 ng ml -1 )/ cycloheximide (CHX) (1 μM) or TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ). Bar, 10 μm. (B) HeLa or A549 cells were incubated for 60 min with TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ). (C) Wild type Jurkat E6.1 cells, caspase-8 deficient, FADD deficient or c-FLIP S over expressing Jurkat cells were incubated with TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ) for 1 h. Bar, 10 µm. (D) Processing of caspase-8 was examined by western blotting following TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ) treatment. The cleaved caspase-8 antibody was used to detect the appearance of the p10 subunit, whereas a second caspase-8 antibody was used to detect the intact zymogen and the p43/41 processed forms (Sun et al., 1999). MCF-7 cells were either untreated (F) or exposed to TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ) (G) and labelled with a different CENP-C antibody (420). Bar, 15 µm. (H-J) MCF-7 cells were exposed to TRAIL (1 μg ml -1 ) as described above but labelled with an ACA antibody against centromeres (red). The TRAIL-induced reduction in ACA staining was prevented by z-VAD.fmk. Bar, 8 µm. (K) MCF-7 and (L) A549 cells were exposed to TRAIL and cells scored for loss of CENP-A, -B or -C as indicated (n≥3).\n\nFor CENP-C, the Kruskal Wallis test was significant at p<0.01 (H=17.72; df=3). Post hoc comparison against the control showed a significant decrease in median values at 2 and 3 h post treatment (p<0.01). For CENP-A, Kruskal Wallis was significant at p<0. 05 (H=9.25; df=3). A decrease in the median percentage was only seen at 3 h (p<0.05). (L) For CENP-C, the Kruskal Wallis test was significant at p<0.01 (H=14.3; df=3). A significant decrease was apparent at 3 h (p<0.01). For CENP-B, there was no evidence of a significant decrease in medians at any time (H=5.6; df=3). MCF-7 cells showed a highly significant decrease in CENP-C labelling using the Spearmans Rank Test. From 4-6 h, the approximate rate of decrease was ~15 % h -1 . C loss (n=4, 100-300 G2 cells were counted in each experiment). This treatment resulted in a significant difference in the median % of CENP-C loss in wild type compared to non-cleavable INCENP (D-A) (p< 0.05).
