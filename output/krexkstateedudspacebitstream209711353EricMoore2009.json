    "abstract": "This thesis answers the questions: How should the terms interaction, individualization, and personalization be applied to Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) software? What progress has been made in their implementation? How can CALL software developers better incorporate them in the future? For each of the three terms, I explain how it is applicable to the CALL software environment by defining it, describing the pedagogical research supporting it, and then giving general guidelines for incorporating it into a CALL software program. I measure the progress of the implementation of the three terms in CALL software through compiling and analyzing data from reviews of 44 software titles. The publication dates of the software titles are from 1981 to 2008. I propose through description and a proof-of-concept software program ways to improve the incorporation of the terms in question into CALL software. As a result of answering the three questions, this thesis shows that the current accepted definitions and ways of implementing interaction, individualization, and personalization need to be improved in order to comply with pedagogical research and make full use of current technology. The general",
    "full_text": "guidelines given in the explanation of each term relative to CALL and the attributes under each term in the analysis of the compilation data provide examples of areas on which to focus development. Additionally, I specifically comment on pedagogically supported attributes within each term that have a weak representation in the software compilation and therefore need more development.\n\nIn addition, this thesis is accompanied by \"Mis vacaciones\", a proof-of-concept software program, which demonstrates ways to improve the incorporation of interaction, individualization, and personalization into CALL software. In \"Mis vacaciones\", the learner takes a virtual trip to Nuevo Leon, Nicaragua. The multimedia sent to the learner by a previous traveler shows Nicaraguan city people and the La Gigatona festival. After visiting, the learner is asked to describe the Nicaraguans that they saw. If the learner needs help, Structured Input activities lead the learner to develop the third person singular imperfect form. Buttons in the software environment provide access to internet sources. The learner is able to draw and take photos to create a visual prop to aid in the description task.\n\nFigure 1.1 Second Language Acquisition Process (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 142) ....................             vii Table 1.1 Structured Input Activity Guidelines (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 154;VanPatten 1996) ...

The teaching system is a subset of the education system. Which element is the weak link in the LTS? I define the weak link as the element that has not kept up with the progression of the other elements.\n\nThe LTS presently consists of teachers, language pedagogy, technology, and computer aided language learning (CALL) software. Not all of the elements in the LTS have always been the same as they are now. For example, ancient Roman teachers wore togas while teachers now commonly wear business casual attire. The \"Evolution of Language Pedagogy\" section of this paper presents the progression of pedagogy in the language teaching system. As the \"Brief History of Technology in the Classroom\" section shows, the technologies used in the classroom have progressed in their potential for student-centered use. For example, in 1967, most classrooms had phonographs and silent filmstrip projectors (Popham, 1969, pp. 334-35). Today, most classrooms or students have access to laptops. Technology is consequently not the weak link. In the early 1980s, personal computers became affordable enough to include in school systems beyond the engineering programs of universities. The introduction of computers as one of the technologies available to teachers also introduced software into the teaching system.\n\nBecause teachers and learners delegate some or most of the role of teacher to CALL software when learners use it inside and outside of the classroom, they place emphasis on three common instructional practices: interaction, individualization, and personalization. These three attributes of teaching thus become the standard to measure the progress of CALL software. The \"Definition of Terms and Their Applications to CALL\" section of this paper explains these terms and relates them to CALL software.\n\nThe \"Software Compilation\" section dissects 44 CALL software titles published from 1981 to 2008 (Appendix A) in order to establish the progression of interaction, individualization, and personalization. Based on the progress shown in the following sections, I conclude that CALL software has not progressed as much as the other elements in the LTS. Therefore, it is the weakest link. However, being the weakest link is not fatal in the LTS. The \"Software Compilation\" section also describes ways that software developers can improve CALL software.\n\nIn Chapter 4, I present my own CALL software program, \"Mis vacaciones\", which addresses some of the issues concerning interaction, individualization, and personalization described in the \"Software Compilation\" section. I present it as a proof-of-concept rather than a model.\n\nThe following definitions offer a brief overview of some terms that this thesis will use and cover more in depth. Figure 1.1 is a general model of the second language acquisition (SLA) process to which some of the definitions will refer in order to contextualize their information.\n\nAccording to Lee and VanPatten (2003), \"input is the language learners hear [and read] that is meant to convey a message\" within a communicative exchange (p. 16). Input, as Figure 1.1 shows, is the root of the SLA process.\n\nComprehensible input (CI) is input that the learner understands sufficiently to be able \"to figure out what the speaker [writer] is saying\" (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 26). CI increases the chances that learners will process elements of the language found in the input (pp. 26-27). Input can be made comprehensible by slowing the rate of the input and modifying its vocabulary, syntax, flow, and setting (pp. 29-30). Interaction can also modify input, making it comprehensible (pp. 31-32).\n\nProcessing Mechanisms Output Developing System Intake Structured Input Lee and VanPatten (2003) define structured input (SI) as: input that is manipulated in particular way to push learners to become dependent on form and structure to get meaning and/or to privilege the form or structure in the input so that learners have a better chance of attending to it (i.e., learners are pulled away from their natural processing tendencies toward more optimal tendencies). (p. 142)\n\nIn Figure 1.1, SI activities make up part of the category marked \"Focused Practice.\" Table 1.1 indicates the six guidelines for developing SI activities that VanPatten (1996) establishes.\n\nProcessing instruction (PI) is grammar instruction developed by VanPatten with the goal to guide and focus learners\" attention when they process input. In Figure 1.1, PI falls into the \"Focused Practice\" category. PI has three components: learners are given information about a linguistic structure or form, \"learners are informed about a particular processing strategy\n\n[behavior] that may negatively affect their picking up the form or structure during comprehension\" and learners participate in SI activities (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 154;VanPatten, 1996, pp. 1-11).\n\nThe word \"task\" has many definitions. David Nunan (2004) and Rod Ellis (2003), two of the sources used for the task related information in this thesis, refer to seven and nine versions respectively in the process of discussing their own definitions of a pedagogical task. Nunan addresses the issue in this way:\n\nTable 1.1 Structured Input Activity Guidelines (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 154; VanPatten 1996) Guidelines Present one thing at a time Keep meaning in focus Move from sentences to connected discourse. Use both oral and written input. Have the learner do something with the input. Keep the learner\"s processing strategies [behaviors] in mind.\n\nA pedagogical task is a piece of classroom work that involves learners in comprehending, manipulating, producing or interacting in the target language while their attention is focused on mobilizing their grammatical knowledge in order to express meaning, and in which the intention is to convey meaning rather than to manipulate form. The task should also have a sense of completeness, being able to stand alone as a communicative act in its own right with a beginning, a middle, and an end. (2004, p. 4) The definition that Ellis (2003) arrives at is more specific than Nunan\"s:\n\nA task is a work plan that requires learners to process language pragmatically in order to achieve an outcome that can be evaluated in terms of whether the correct or appropriate propositional content has been conveyed. To this end, it requires them to give primary attention to meaning and to make use of their own linguistic resources, although the design of the task may predispose them to choose particular forms. A task is intended to result in language use that bears a resemblance, direct or indirect, to the way language is used in the real world. Like other language activities, a task can engage productive or receptive, and oral or written skills, and also various cognitive processes. (p. 16) These two definitions inform the tasks that I incorporate into \"Mis vacaciones\", the proof of concept CALL software program that accompanies this thesis.\n\nI use a combination of the two definitions because both do not exactly fit what a task can be in the CALL environment. An example of this is that Nunan refers to a task as \"a piece of classroom work \" (2004, p. 4). It is, however, difficult to define a classroom when using CALL.\n\nA classroom could be typical physical classroom, a learner\"s home, a learner\"s office, a bus, a virtual environment or any number of other arrangements. In Nunan\"s defense, he does specify more thoroughly than Ellis what the learners will do during a task. Ellis defines the learners actions as \"process[ing] language pragmatically in order to achieve an outcome\" (2003, p. 16).\n\nThe term \"processing\" as Ellis uses it refers to comprehending and not to the processing that occurs during SI activities. Ellis also refers to linguistic resources in his definition but fails to mention that learners can and should use nonlinguistic resources such as objects, body language, gestures, and facial expressions. Finally, with CALL, one learner may be performing the task with non-learners (natives, computer simulations or virtual persons); however, both definitions assume that only learners are actors in the task.\n\nCommunicative competence is composed of four sub-competencies: grammatical, sociolinguistic, discourse, strategic (Savignon, 1997, p. 40). Each of these sub-competencies has extra-linguistic, listening comprehension, reading, socio-cultural, speaking, and writing components. This thesis refers to these components in the software compilation section under the \"Works on these competencies\" attribute.\n\nThe Grammar-Translation method was used to teach modern languages in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Hadley states that, \"its primary purpose was to enable students to access and appreciate great literature, while helping them understand their native language better through extensive analysis of the grammar of the target language and translation\" (Hadley, 2001, p. 106).\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, behaviorist psychology influenced how researchers conceived that language learning occurred (Hadely, 2001, p. 57). This influence carried over into language teaching with the advent of the audiolingual methodology. Table 1.2 is a list of the key tenets of behaviorism.\n\nTable 1.2 Tenets of Behaviorist Theory (Hadely, 2001, p. 57) Num Tenet 1 Human learning and animal learning are similar. 2\n\nThe child\"s mind is a tabula rasa. There is no innate pre-programming specifically for language learning at birth. 3\n\nPsychological data should be limited to that which is observable. 4\n\nAll behavior is viewed as a response to stimuli. Behavior happens in associative chains; in fact, all learning is associative in nature. 5\n\nConditioning involves the strengthening of associations between a stimulus and a response through reinforcement. 6\n\nHuman language is a \"sophisticated response system\" acquired through operant conditioning.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, descriptive linguistics was influential along with behaviorist psychology (see Behavorist Theory). Descriptive linguistics is concerned with the structure of languages based on their phonemes and morphemes. Together these two fields of study generated the audiolingual methodology (ALM) of language learning (Hadley, 2001, pp. 57, 110;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 9;Savignon, 1997, pp. 23-26). Table 1.3 indicates the tenets of the ALM. Common types of activities in ALM were memorizing dialogues until the learner achieved perfect pronunciation and intonation, repetition and transformation drills, and application activities (Hadley, 2001, pp. 111-112;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 9;Savignon, 1997, p. 25). The application activities the learner \"worked mainly with memorized material, repeating it, manipulating it, or transforming it to meet minimal communicative needs\" (Hadley, 2001, p. 112).\n\nCommunicative Language Teaching (CLT) developed in the 1970s as a reaction to and a rejection of the ALM that had been popular from the 1940s through the 1960s. Table 1.4 lists the principle tenets of CLT. This approach to language teaching is more student-centered than the ALM. The types of activities that fit into the CLT approach are interactive language games including simulations and role-plays, information sharing activities, task-based activities, social interaction, and functional communication practice (Hadley, 2001, p 117).\n\nTable 1.3 Tenets of the Audiolingual Methodology (Savignon, 1997, pp. 25-26) Num Tenets 1 Language learning is habit formation. 2 Language performance consists of four basic skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. 3 L2 learning, like L1 learning, should begin with listening and speaking, regardless of the end goal of the learner. 4\n\nA contrastive analysis of the phonological and structural differences between L1 and L2 provides the most effective basis for materials development and sequence. 5\n\nThe basic unit practice should always be a complete structure. Production should proceed from repetition to substitution and continue until responses are automatic. Spontaneous expression should be delayed until the more advanced levels of instruction. Production errors in structural or phonological features mean that the patterns have not received sufficient prior drilling. 6\n\nThe teacher is the center of all classroom activity and is responsible for maintaining attention and a lively pace.\n\nJames J. Asher developed Total Physical Response (TPR) in the early 1970s. Hadley\n\nindicates that Asher based this approach:\n\non the belief that listening comprehension should be developed fully, as it is with children learning their native language, before any active oral participation from students is expected. Further, it is based on the belief that skills can be more rapidly assimilated if the teacher appeals to the students\" kinesthetic-sensory system. (2001, p. 118) Learners doing TPR activities carry out actions as directed by the instructor\"s oral commands to\n\nshow their language comprehension. After an initial period of listening and acting, the instructor encourages the learners to give commands when they are ready. The teacher and learners repeat the sequence of listening and then producing with increasingly complex material. As the class advances, learners prepare and perform skits and problem solving situations (pp. 117-118).\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, learning styles and strategies became increasingly important in educational planning. Hadley notes that before this time period, \"conventional wisdom…[was] that second-language acquisition theories should attempt to explain how \"the learner\" develops competence, as though learners were a relatively homogenous lot\" (2001, p. 75). Learning styles (LSs) are \"the general approaches students use to learn any subject,\n\nTable 1.4 Tenets of Communicative Language Teaching (Savignon, 1997, pp. 28-29)\n\nNum Tenets 1 Language use is creative. Learners use whatever knowledge they have of a language system to express their meaning in an infinite variety of ways. 2\n\nLanguage use consists of many abilities in a broad communicative framework. The nature of the particular abilities needed is dependent on the roles of the participants, the situation and the goal of the interaction. 3 L2 learning, like L1 learning, begins with the needs and interests of the learner. 4\n\nAn analysis of learner needs and interests provides the most effective basis for materials development. 5\n\nThe basic unit of practice should always be a text or a chunk of discourse. Production should begin with the conveyance of meaning. Formal accuracy in the beginning stages should be neither required nor expected. 6\n\nThe teacher assumes a variety of roles to permit learner participation in a wide range of communicative situations.\n\nincluding a second language\" (Oxford, Ehrman & Lavine, 1991, as cited in Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, p. 196). LSs have dimensions such as sensory preference(s), intuitive vs. sensing, and global vs. analytic. Oxford (1993) defines learning strategies as being \"more specific than learning styles.\n\nStrategies are the particular behaviors that learners employ, usually intentionally, to enhance their understanding, storage, retrieval, and ultimate use of information\" (Riney, 1978, as cited in Oxford, 1993, p. 65). In SLA, \"examples include note-taking, seeking conversation partners, developing empathy with the target culture, skimming, previewing, and guessing to understand what is read or heard.\" (p. 65). More than one strategy can map to a particular LS. Appendix C\n\ngives more examples of learning strategies.\n\nIn 1954, Piaget became the first constructivist when he wrote The Construction of Reality in the Child, a book in which he depicts a child as a scientist constructing meaning from the surrounding environment (Oxford, 1997, p. 39). Constructivism, however, remained an obscure philosophy until the 1990s when it became part of the movement for active and experiential learning. This movement is against teacher-centered classrooms and the lecture-plus multiplechoice tests structure of education (p. 46).\n\nThere are two general schools of constructivism: \"those considering…the knowledge constructor to be the individual…and those viewing the…knowledge constructor as the whole society or group or as the individual as firmly embedded in the group\" (p. 45). Independent of these schools of thought:\n\nconstructivism is a philosophy of learning founded on the premise that, by reflecting on our experiences, we construct our own understanding of the world we live in. Each of us generates our own \"rules\" and \"mental models,\" which we use to make sense of our experiences. Learning, therefore, is simply the process of adjusting our mental models to accommodate new experiences. (On Purpose Associates, 2001)\n\nI use the term \"cognitive map\" in this thesis to refer to a written visualization of how items such as concepts, ideas, pictures, and grammar items connect or relate to one another.\n\nConcept maps, webs, and idea maps are specific examples of cognitive maps. See Table 1.5 for more information.\n\nTable 1.6 presents a brief history of language pedagogy. To make a clear sketch, I have included the approaches, methodologies, and concepts that researchers and professionals stressed during each period. The items that appear in each period may or may not extend into subsequent periods. The time-periods represent approximately when the items became popular as indicated by the sources listed in the table\"s caption.\n\nTable 1.6 History of Language Learning (Hadley, 2001; Larsen, 1987; Oxford & Madeleine, 1993; Oxford, 1997; Wang & University of Central Florida, 2005) Year Range Methods, Concepts, Approaches Emphasized <=1960s Behaviorism, Grammar-Translation method, Audiolingual Methodology, drills 1970s Communicative competency, Communicative Language Teaching, TPR, how to correct errors, contextualizing language learning Mid 1980s Teaching grammar in meaningful context, oral proficiency, structure drills so that they approximate normal exchange, comprehensible input, role of input and output, tasks Late 1980s & Early 1990s Communicativeness, interaction, learning styles and strategies, cooperative learning, multi-modal lessons Mid 1990s & Late 1990s Teacher as a facilitator, scaffolding, constructivism, how to focus-on-form & communication Early 2000s Constructivism, problem solving, learning as an active and collaborative process Table 1.5 Common Cognitive Maps (Inspiration Software Inc, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c) Cognitive Maps Description Concept map Two or more concepts are linked by words that describe their relationship Webs Webs are visual maps that show how different categories of information relate to one another. Webs provide structure for ideas and facts and give students a flexible framework for organizing and prioritizing information. Idea maps Idea maps help students brainstorm, solve problems and plan their work. Using word and idea association, idea maps connect keywords, symbols, colors and graphics to form nonlinear networks of potential ideas and thoughts.\n\nThe table (Table 1.6) shows a progression in various language-teaching areas having to do with making language learning more learner-centered. For example, from the 1960s to the early 2000s, there is a shift in the learner\"s role in the classroom. In the 1960s, language teaching is mainly teacher-centered. The employment of audiolingualism, mechanical drills, and instruction on grammar and translation is evidence of a teacher-centered classroom because the learner is a recipient of the teacher\"s knowledge (Hadley, 2001). However, in the early 2000s,\n\nTable 1.6 indicates that the learner produces and constructs knowledge in the classroom because of movements like CLT and constructivism. One of the principles of constructivism indicates that learners must take an active role in the learning process. Further evidence of the progression from teacher-centeredness to learner-centeredness is exhibited by the emphasis on the communicativeness of lessons, the effects of different error correction methods on learners, comprehensible input, learning styles and strategies, and the teacher as a facilitator after the 1960s. Finally, from the 1960s to the present, Table 1.6 shows that the importance of receiving input in relation to producing output has increased.\n\nTeachers can incorporate many different technologies into current classrooms. Table 1.7\n\nshows a list of most of the technologies available to teachers for their classrooms. The list is in chronological order according to when a particular technology started appearing in classrooms.\n\nTable 1.7 indicates that technology is becoming more learner-centered. I demonstrate this by an analysis of who uses the technology and when that technology is used. For example, teachers use instructional audio cassettes and film projectors during class time. Teachers also create and use transparencies for overhead projectors during class time. The learner does not play a major role in the educational use of technology until audio laboratories become popular. Audio laboratories, however, allow limited oral interaction. When personal computers (PCs) appear in the early 1980s, they increase learnerusage of educational technology, first in laboratories and then in the classroom. The space necessary for desktop systems, however, makes it impractical to have more than a few computers in a classroom. The increasing popularity of PCs means that learners can also use educational technology at home. As time moves forward, technologies such as clickers, digital projectors, laptops, and various handheld devices allow individuals, pairs, groups, and classes to interact with each other and teachers. Laptops, handheld devices, and tablet PCs also make it possible for learners to transport technology to and from the classroom. Thus, technology has historically been teacher-centered, but recent advances in technology are enabling the teacher to shift the focus to the learner. Table 1.7 Progression of Classroom Technology (Popham, 1969, pp. 334-35; Fought, 1987; National Education Association, 1992, pp. 53-55; National Education Association, 2001, p. 65; Manuelvuelta, 2006; Enlaces Centro de Educación y Tecnología Chile, 2007; Means, Roschelle, Penuel, Sabelli, & Haertel, 2003; Selene486, 2007) Year Technology in the Classroom 2007 Tablet PCs in classrooms Students bring their own laptops Handheld devices (e.g. Pocket PC) Electronic \"chalk\" boards (e.g. Smartboards, Ebeam, Interwrite, etc) Clickers Cellular telephones 1985 1960s Laptops for students Laptops for Teachers Digital Projectors ELMOS Desktop computer for teacher Student desktop computers in classrooms Student desktop computers in laboratories Listening Laboratories (cassettes y CDs) Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs) Televisions Transparency projectors Motion picture projector (8mm & 16mm) Film strip projectors with or without audio Audio cassettes Phonographs CHAPTER 2 -Definition of Terms and Their Applications to CALL The history of software developed for language learning as shown in Appendix B reveals an ignorance or misinterpretation of accepted terminology and methodology in the field of language acquisition. As an example, Table 2.1 on the following page shows a set of data from the tables of Appendix B. I based the data on CALL software titles published after the 1970s, so based on the data in Table 1.6 (History of Language Learning) the values of the \"Focus on Input:\n\nInteractive\", \"Communicative\", \"Social-Cultural\", \"Speaking\", and \"The learner needs to learn/understand…\" attributes should be higher throughout all the periods. While overall there is consistent improvement, none of the attributes in question are found in 50 percent or more of the CALL software of any period. On the contrary, in P1 and P2, an emphasis on grammar and vocabulary dominates. Additionally, 20 percent of the software titles in P3 were digital versions of grammar workbooks. In P2 and P3, the \"Speaking\" attribute, at first glance, appears to be a great addition to the troubled mixture, but the technology is applied mainly for learner vs. native voice comparison, which is ALMish. The absence of the \"The learner needs to learn/understand…\" attribute in the first two periods and the weak emphasis placed on it in P3 is also reminiscent of the repetition drills associated with ALM. Therefore, the majority of the Appendix D indicates the attributes that each of the CALL software programs in the compilation actually have with respect to interaction, individualization, and personalization. All of the programs have parts that fit into the advertised categories, but unlike their use in literature, synecdoches (using a part to describe a whole) do not adequately describe a software program.\n\nThe advertised characteristics of a language learning software program must be motifs throughout its design and content. Therefore, the following section defines interaction, individualization, and personalization. It also explains how software developers can incorporate them into CALL software programs.\n\nTable 2.1 Overview of the History of CALL Software (info taken from Appendix B) Attributes Percentage of Software Titles With the Specified Attribute per Period P1 P2 P3 1981-1988 1988-1996 >1996 \"Technified\" Work Book 22% NF 19% Focus on Input: Interactive 11% 20% 38% Communicative 11% NF 44% Competencies Worked Grammar/Vocabulary 83% 70% 31% Listening Comprehension 6% 30% 69% Reading 17% 30% 44% Social-Cultural 6% NF 13% Writing NF NF 38% Speaking NF 20% 44% Native/Learner Comparison NF 20% 31% Voice Rec. or Answer Selection via Voice NF NF 13%\n\nThe learner needs to learn/understand to complete a task NF NF 31%\n\nNF: Indicates that no data was found.\n\nIn her 1987 book, Interactive Language Teaching, Rivers defines interaction as the \"…conveying and receiving [of] authentic messages (that is, messages that contain information of interest to speaker [sender] and listener [receiver] in a situation [environment] of importance to both)\" (4). Rivers\" definition suggests a basic model of communication (Figure 2.1).\n\nTherefore, interaction needs a sender, listener, at least two messages of interest to both parties and at least one channel through which the messages can travel, all of which are located in an environment important to the sender and the receiver. There must be at least two messages because the sender may send a message but not receive anything in return, which is a null message. The plausible situation that, upon perceiving a null message, the sender may resend the original message, redirect the original message, or do nothing confirms that a null message is a valid message. Sending an email is an example of such a situation. When there is no response from the receiver, the sender may send another message, send the message to a different email address or not do anything.\n\nIn the computer age, the interactionist approach to language teaching has expanded into the use of CALL software programs. In fact, Carol A. Chapelle, a prolific author on the subject of computer aided language learning (CALL), deals with the topic in her article entitled \"Multimedia CALL: Lessons to be learned from research on instructed SLA.\" She states, \"When addressing applied questions such as design and evaluation of multimedia CALL, it is necessary to select from the many approaches those that are relevant\" (21). Her selection of approaches starts at the research level. She categorizes \"…approaches to SLA research on the basis of their Situation/Environment Receiver's Message Sender's Message Sender Receiver\n\ninterface with teaching…\" into three types: coexists, collaborates, and complements. Research into SLA that coexists with language teaching has \"little if any intellectual interface\" (21).\n\nStudies done on the effect that learning a language has on the learner fall into the \"coexists\" category. Collaborative research occurs when researchers and teachers work together to achieve the same goal in the classroom. An example of this is research into ways to teach communicatively. Research that complements language teaching studies the impact of complementarity, the utilization of \"theoretically grounded learning materials and strategies to facilitate L2 learning\" in the classroom ( 22). The supporting research for contextualization of and interaction with language materials falls in this category. Table 1.7 suggests that software is now a complimentary component in the language classroom as many of the technologies listed utilize it. Therefore, Chapelle reasons that the interaction approach is relevant to its design and content.\n\nThe interaction approach is different from the human-machine interaction approach inherent in many of the CALL software programs of which I read reviews. The environment in those programs as it pertains to interaction is the content that the software program is showing or has displayed for the user. For instance, if the questions are grammatical in nature, the user commonly conjugates a verb to reflect a certain tense, person, and number dictated by the instructions or by the context given by a few words in the sentence. In both situations, the environmental part of the definition of interaction is only important to the learner because the software already knows the correct answer without consulting the learner or the environment.\n\nAdditionally, the environment is not important to the software because it usually does not plan on doing anything with the answer except indicating its correctness according to the given instructions. If the answer is correct, the lesson will continue; an incorrect answer will at best trigger an error correction subroutine. Consequently, it is possible for a software program to display information on present tense and then test on the use of preterit tense. Software programs that ignore the environment only test the performance of the learner and do not interact with the learner.\n\nIn addition to the importance of the environment (situation) to both sender and receiver,\n\nRivers\" definition of interaction also asserts that the messages exchanged must be of interest to both parties. This role of interest in interaction is not complete, however. Her definition allows the learner not to be interested in his own message. The definition of interaction, therefore, should specify that both participants are interested in the messages they send and receive respectively. The information in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 supports this stricter definition. Table 2.2 lists the 16 combinations of a sender and a receiver being interested in the messages they receive and send. Combinations five through sixteen are not valid interaction scenarios according to Rivers\" definition because either the sender or the receiver is not interested in the received message. Rivers\" definition, however, does accept the first four combinations. They are those in which the sender and receiver are interested in the messages they receive respectively. Her definition, therefore, does not mean that one or both parties must also be interested in the messages they send because combinations two through four permit lack of interest in the message sent. This looseness in the definition allows for breakdowns (items 2-4 in Table 2.2) in the first scenario of Table 2.2, the only truly interactive scenario. Table 2.3 explains possible reasons for the decomposition of the first scenario into items two through four.\n\nSender\"s interest in Receiver\"s interest in Own message Receiver\"s message Sender\"s message Own message\n\nResearch on using feedback in language learning also supports the need for the stricter definition of interaction. Similarly to the concept of \"importance,\" to exhibit \"interest\" means the sender and receiver must do something with the messages they receive. They must process the received messages in order to respond or give feedback. If a participant does not respond or responds inappropriately as has happened in situations two through four of Table 2.2, the interaction between the participants weakens (decomposes). In the case of interaction in language learning, it is important that participants in interactive activities respond to the content of the messages and not just to its syntax or grammar (Hadley, 2001, p. 263). A language learner may feel overly scrutinized by an inappropriate emphasis on form. Therefore, interacting participants have to process both the form and the meaning of the messages received. Table 2.2, which lists the possible interactive combinations derived from Rivers\" definition, is also useful in explaining why sender and receiver should process both content and form. Assuming that at the start of interaction, the first situation in Table 2.2 is present, the situation becomes a Type 2 situation if the sender loses interest in his own message. Number 2 of Table 2.2 offers some learner perceptions or reasons for a Type 1 to Type 2 situation decomposition. The receiver that pays too much attention to grammar and gives more feedback on it than on the message\"s content may generate these perceptions, which lead the sender to stop interacting out of frustration. The reasons in Number 2 of Table 2.2 also indicate that the sender and receiver have taken on roles associated with the Atlas complex as described by Lee and VanPatten (2003, p. 6). The senderreceiver relationship is a generalized version of a teacher-student relationship so the roles of authoritative transmitter and receptive vessel are applicable (pp. 6-7). To maximize language\n\nTable 2.3 Reasons for the First Through Fourth Interactive Situations in Table 2.2 Situation # Possible Reasons for the Situations 1 This is the ideal interactive situation. 2 Sender wants the receiver to talk, thinks the receiver is not interested or valuing the message, or wants only to know the right answer from the receiver. 3 Receiver is being rude, lying, tiring of the material, not accounting for learner strategies or styles, or trying to keep the learner talking (ALM or other methods that are output based). 4 This is the worst scenario classifiable under River\"s definition. Both participants, through a combination of the reasons in situations two and three, have lost interest in the messages they respectively send.\n\nlearning and the learning of other subjects, the communicative approach to SLA advises teachers and, in this case, any interacting participants to avoid Atlas complex roles (Hadley, 2001, p. 95).\n\nAnother way for a CALL software program to show that it is interested in the responses that it gives is for CALL software developers to keep learning strategies (LSs) in mind in the design and content of the program. Some authors even suggest that a CALL program should test or inform the learner on LSs (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, pp.188-190;Ehrman & Oxford, 1990 pp. 312, 323-324). However, there is no agreed upon learning strategies test (i.e. a biographical questionnaire, Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT), Motivation and Strategies Questionnaire (MSQ), the Ehrman and Leaver Learning Style Questionnaire (E&L), the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), or the Hartmann Boundary Questionnaire (HBQ)) or even a consensus that one test can accurately inform someone about a person\"s LSs (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993; Ehrman, 2001; Clark, 2007). In addition, there is no context under which to separately test or teach LSs in a CALL software program. It is a language-learning program, not a self-help program. The key, then, is to keep in mind that using LSs helps generate a positive perception of interest, which decreases the chance of a breakdown in interaction. Consequently, the activities in CALL software should incorporate LSs but not directly teach or test them.\n\nIndividualization is the changing, modifying, or forming of a resource by an outside force (e.g. teacher, software developer, artisan) to fit the perceived needs, uses, or preferences of an individual. For example, individualized attention describes the modification of the resource \"attention\" to suit an individual. One-at-a-time access is usually inherent in a system where a one-resource-to-many-individuals relationship and a desire to individualize exist. However, an outside force also individualizes a resource if it is sufficiently efficient at multi-tasking and Due to the time-consuming nature of individualization even with CALL, differentiation or the modification of design, content, or both for groups of students is more popular and practical. Since the mid 1990s, CALL software developers have typically used two methods to address individualization and differentiation. The first method makes the flow of the program less strict. This approach allows the learner to arrive at the same knowledge through different pathways, branches or tracts. When developers have implemented this well, the pathways are not fixed, so the learner creates or personalizes the path instead of the software dictating it (Hadley, 2001, pp. 163;Fought, 1987).\n\nIn addition to tools and designs that allow for multiple tracts, developers integrate tools to take into account learning styles and strategies (LSS). In the CALL software (Appendix A) published before the year 2000, CALL takes an input modality approach to covering LSS. It relies on combinations of text, images, sound, and occasionally videos. This represents a visual, audio, and kinesthetic (VAK) approach to LSS (Clark, 2008). These software programs rely on the \"interaction\" of typing and mouse clicking to satisfy the kinesthetic part.\n\nAfter the year 2000, CALL takes a different approach to working with LSS. It starts allowing for memory, cognitive, compensation, meta-cognitive, affective, and social strategies (Ehrman & Oxford, 1990, pp. 314-315). To apply this approach to LSS, software developers include in CALL software tools that allow for content interpretation, control over content, and discovery (Hadley 161-163;Kahn, 1991). Some examples of these tools are note taking features, audio and video control, advanced-feedback, and immersion environments. Note taking allows the learner to personalize and process the content through the learner\"s schemata. A common feature also in this period is allowing the learner to control (stop, start, pause, and replay) video and sound content, as he or she would be able to do in a non-pedagogical environment.\n\nAdvanced feedback points the learner to the section of a video that contains the answer so that the learner discovers the answer instead of being told the answer (Kahn, 1991). Similarly, immersion enables learners to discover through the exploration of a virtual environment.\n\nAs CALL software incorporates more of the principles of the communicative and the constructivism movements in language learning, personalization will dominate over individualization. Even though, as my review of the history of CALL software suggests, the evolution of CALL software is slow, it still approximates \"the changing goals of language education and the shifting conditions in our postindustrial society\" (Wang, 2005, p. 2). Soon CALL software will leave behind the behaviorist approaches and embrace the fact that \"Language is a living thing, so the best way to learn a language is in interactive, authentic environments\" (1). Humans are famous for personalizing rather than individualizing their environments, so CALL software developers will create more tools to increase the personalization of learning. Individualization will evolve to mean incorporating those tools into a CALL platform to suit different learning styles and strategies.\n\nIn the concrete business, individualization is constructing the frames, mixing the concrete, and pouring the concrete into the framing. For the average concrete pad, personalization occurs when the owner(s) put their initials, date, hand or foot print into the fresh concrete. The same relationship between individualization and personalization exists with With CALL software, there are two types of personalization: teacher and learner.\n\nTypically, the learner is the focus of personalization; however, software designers should also give teachers the tools to personalize the software, to change the content and to adjust other features. Teachers need to personalize CALL software in this manner because of evolving expectations in the field of teaching. Some recent evolutions include placing greater emphasis on differentiation and individualization, changing acceptable methodologies, and emphasizing the use of technology in classrooms.\n\nThe greater emphasis on differentiation and individualization has made it important for teachers to be able to personalize CALL software since they know their students better than software developers do. In addition, the characteristics of their students including gender, age, background, interests, and other demographic aspects can change from class to class and from year to year. There is evidence to suggest that male and females may prefer different content.\n\nCultural values and gender roles played by the learners can also affect what content is interesting to the learner (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993). Independent of culture and gender, the age of the learner can affect the material in which the learner is interested and how the teacher should present it (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993;Oxford, 1993;Schleppegrell, 1987;Schulz & Elliott, 2000).\n\nResearch that supports this also suggests that many classroom activities that involve speed and repetition bias the language classroom against older adults (Schulz & Elliott, 2000).\n\nAnother evolution in teaching is the \"shift in educational paradigms from a behavioral to a constructivist learning approach\" (Wang, 2005). Many teachers no longer view audiolingualistic drills and activities as being as pedagogically sound as they once were. They are replacing mechanical and meaningful drills of traditional instruction as defined by Lee and VanPatten with communicative activities (2003, pp. 120-123). There are many types of communicative activities such as drills, group work, and tasks from which teachers can choose (Hadley, 2001). Within each type, there is an assortment of kinds of activities such as pedagogical and real life tasks (Ellis, 2003, p. 6;Nunan, 2004). Additionally, as constructivism becomes stronger, \"the teacher\"s role should shift from \"sage on the stage\" to \"guide on the side\",\" which means teachers will choose activities in which problem solving is the focus and CALL software acts as a facilitator in the process (Wang, 2005, p. 2). The broader range of activities from which a teacher can choose indicates that CALL software that is not personalizable by the teacher may not fit as a facilitator in the changing style(s) of many teachers. This is especially evident given the rapid technological growth towards more studentcentered devices suggested by Table 1.7 and surveys done by the National Education Association (1992,2001). Devices such as electronic dry erase boards, digital projectors, laptops, and tablet\n\nPCs favor the changing teacher-student paradigm, but CALL software that is not personalizable resists being taken out of the fixed environment of the language laboratory and used in the dynamic environment of teaching.\n\nAs the communicative and constructivist movements take hold and evolve in the teaching field, the vision of the ideal environment for language learning evolves. Currently, \"the best way to learn a language is in interactive, authentic environments\" because language is viewed as a living thing (Wang, 2005, p. 2). For CALL software, the authenticity requirement means that the learner has to be present in the environment in order to receive the maximum benefit. Using the concrete analogy, the accident while building the dam and the bad encounter with the Mafia would not have the same affect if the learner watched it on television as it would if the learner participated in the ordeals. This is because while participating in a situation the learner applies three systems to personalize it: the learner\"s mind, social awareness and input processing system.\n\nFor example, in the concrete analogy, the learner might be thinking that he or she does not like the feeling of half-dried blood on his or her arms, wondering what his or her mother will think and trying to decode what the person with the accent is saying. Since participation involves personalization by the learner\"s mind, social awareness, and input processing system, CALL software should incorporate these systems into itself to create the affect of participation.\n\nThe aspects of the learner\"s mind that are especially valuable to CALL software are the learner\"s preferences, previous knowledge, and output (PPkO). These are important because \"Learning is an active process,\" and \"Learning is a natural, integral, and ubiquitous part of living; not something handed as a package to somebody else\" (Wang, 2005, p. 2). Consequently, the learner must work to learn. Many factors affect whether work or, in this case, learning/acquisition takes place. Some of these factors are motivation, anxiety, and self-esteem (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993;Schulz & Elliott, 2000). Allowing the learner to personalize CALL software with PPkO enhances motivation, lowers anxiety, and improves self-esteem.\n\nAccording to Oxford and Ehrman, motivation consists of four internal constructs that lead the learner to demonstrate decision-making, persistence, and activity level in a beneficial manner (1993, pp. 190-192). These four internal constructs are interest, relevance, expectancy, and outcomes. Personalization by PPkO enhances motivation because the learner intercalates into the software information that is interesting and relevant to him or herself. This means the leaner must instantiate schemata as defined by Hadley in order to relate enough to the content to apply the necessary preferences, background knowledge, and output (2001, pp. 147-149). For example, when a learner elects preferences like colors, characters, places, and clothing in response to some aspect of a lesson, the selection is based on what is relevant and interesting according to the learner´s schemata concerning the lesson´s content. Since the learner is now part of the lesson, the experience will be more fun, entertaining, and emotionally involving.\n\nResults like the three behavioral attributes I just mentioned help keep the learner\"s attention and help him or her remember (Kahn, 1991(Kahn, , p. 1144)). Consequently, the learner, unknowingly, becomes a source of positive motivation to learn the content.\n\nThe third and fourth internal constructs of motivation; that is, expectancy and outcomes, relate closely to anxiety and self-esteem. Expectancy is the belief that a behavior done by oneself will result or not result in some desired outcome(s) (Kelly, n.d.;Oxford & Ehrman, 1993). The \"outcomes refer [to] the intrinsic or extrinsic rewards felt by the learner while learning\" (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, pp. 191). These outcomes, which I will call sub-outcomes for clarity, are not limited to the desired outcome(s) set by expectancy. The learner experiences many sub-outcomes during a non-CALL or CALL language lesson. These sub-outcomes include but are not limited to answers to questions both spoken and unspoken, paralinguistic data, and receiving or giving information and feedback. Without personalization by PPkO, the focus of a language lesson is on getting correct answers; therefore, many of the sub-outcomes are of the type right/wrong. Personalization by PPkO shifts the focus of the lesson onto the learner and expressing oneself. The learner\"s sub-outcome(s), therefore, are of the type successful communication/non-successful communication. These sub-outcomes are more meaningful to the learner and more interactive (using the stricter definition). Thus, as VanPatten suggests, this focus is more congruent with the current input, communicative and constructivist movements in language teaching (1996, p. 59).\n\nAnxiety is a facilitating or debilitating state of apprehension and a vague, sometimes undefined, fear. There are global and situational anxieties (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, pp. 193-194). Debilitating anxiety can affect motivation by inserting overwhelming fear as an element to overcome when a learner is deciding expectancy. The fear attacks a learner\"s self-efficacy or \"perception of one\"s own competence\" by leading a learner to believe that a behavior or a task is too difficult; thus, a learner may feel a negative expectancy for behavior that would result in the desired outcome(s) (Kelly, n.d.). Facilitating anxiety works on a learner by encouraging behaviors such as studying, interacting, and asking for assistance in order to enhance the learner\"s self-efficacy.\n\nImproving self-efficacy is important because it is a component of self-esteem. Selfesteem is a \"self-judgment of worth or value based on feelings of \"[self-] efficacy\"\" (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, p. 194). Like anxiety, self-esteem is global and situational (194). This means that a learner could feel not good at anything, not good at learning a language, or just not good at certain tasks like public speaking.\n\nAs was suggested in the section about interest and relevance, personalization by PPkO directs a learner to focus on the input and expression, thereby generating positive sub-outcomes or successes at the start of and throughout a lesson. These small successes can alleviate anxiety and improve low self-esteem in addition to raising interest and relevance levels. Therefore, learners who feel that they are not good at learning languages such as some older adults can benefit from the early success that personalization by PPkO offers (Schleppegrell, 1987).\n\nThe generation of successes involves the creation of constructs, form meaning connections (FMCs), or both. According to cognitive and constructivist theories respectively, these are part of how knowledge is acquired (Hadley 2001, p. 70;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 38-39;Oxford, 1997, pp. 41-43;VanPatten, 1996 p. 10). Apart from creating constructs and FMCs, with CALL software, a learner should utilize these FMCs and constructs to create personal constructions such as stories, comic strips, interviews, songs, and photo sequences.\n\nThese are concrete representations of the learner\"s knowledge. The constructions are beneficial to a learner because while the learners are interacting they become comprehensible input anchored in the here-and-now (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 33). A learner can refer back to them in order to assuage debilitating anxiety or boost self-esteem, similar to how teachers utilize the constructions mentioned above to keep input comprehensible, non-confusing, and non-stressful.\n\nThe effect that personal constructions can have on self-esteem is described by the theory that self-esteem is affected by where an individual attributes the locus of control to be in a situation (Ehrman & Oxford, 1990, pp. 320-322;Kelly, n.d.). Through personalization by PPkO, the software and any learner constructions contain learner-produced and learner-controlled content, so for the learner, the locus of control of that content is internal. The belief that one\"s locus of control is at least partially internal helps build at least situational self-esteem through increasing self-efficacy (Oxford & Ehrman, 1993, pp. 194-195).\n\nConstructs and constructions can be social as well as personal (Oxford, 1997). Humans are social animals, so CALL software should allow personalization with social data (SD) in order to allow the learner to put himself fully into the concrete. For example, with personalization by PPkO, a learner could apply a personal construct of cool/not cool to an interesting object. This, according to Kelly\"s personal construct theory, is the learner giving a personal, idiosyncratic meaning to the encountered object (41). Additionally, as the learner gains more experience and processes the object actively and other objects, he or she will apply more complex and specific constructs to differentiate the object cognitively from other objects and thereby understand it better (42). However, the idiosyncratic meaning the isolated learner develops may not be the final meaning the learner accepts. Prawat suggests with his idea-based social constructivism that the learner is expressing an idea (cool/not cool) about the object created by perceptual schemata and that \"an idea continually evolves because of its use in new [social] situations and activities\" (43). For instance, the learner\"s friends may think the same object is gross rather than cool; therefore, the social construct is cool/gross. This social construct could influence the learner because \"most learners want to have other people available with whom they can compare their strategies and interpretations…\" (Raschio, 1990, p. 539). Consequently, the learner is likely to accept the social construct about the object if he learns negative information about it from his friends. The modification effect on the learner that SD can bring indicates that CALL software should have personalization implemented by SD.\n\nReturning to the concrete metaphor, through the methods of personalization already described, a learner should be able to put him or herself into the concrete. Personalization has made the mixture look appealing and taste appetizing. In addition, when the learner enters the concrete, he or she will not suffer a gag reflex due to stress or anxiety because personalization has made the mixture\"s temperature acceptable. CALL software should still be prepared for one more type of personalization: input processing (IP). When a learner ingests the concrete (input), the learner must chew it. Chewing is the process of applying teeth (IP behaviors) in order to perceive or notice a form in the input and link it with meaning(s), functions(s), or both. Forms are either lexical like the word \"gato\" (cat in Spanish) or grammatical like the Spanish verbal inflections -ó/-é (VanPatten, 2004b, pp. 6-7;VanPatten, Williams, & Rott, 2004, pp. 1-4). The connections formed during chewing are form-meaning connections (FMCs). See Table 2.4 for VanPatten´s list of theoretical IP behaviors that create FMCs (2004b, pp. 7-18). In Figure 2.2, VanPatten illustrates how some of these IP behaviors digest input (2004b, p. 144). As Figure 2.2 also shows, the information that IP yields is the intake for the developing system. IP is, therefore, beneficial and necessary so that accommodation and restructuring can occur in the developing system. Accommodation is the inserting of a new FMC into the developing system.\n\nRestructuring takes place if an accommodation or a new grammatical awareness causes a cascading effect that changes other elements in the developing system (VanPatten, 2004a, pp. 33-35;VanPatten, 2004b, pp. 25-26;VanPatten et al., 2004, pp. 8-9).\n\nHowever beneficial and necessary IP is, it does not always process all of the input (modified or not) efficiently and correctly. VanPatten and other authors suggest that working memory capacity, interaction, L1, universal mechanisms like the One-to-One Principle (initially one form is mapped to one meaning) and a universal grammar play a role in IP behaviors and their success (Lightbown, 2004, p. 69;VanPatten, 1996VanPatten, , 2004aVanPatten, , 2004b;;VanPatten et al., 2004).\n\nVanPatten graphically depicts his ideas about this in Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3. In essence, the learner\"s teeth are not always appropriate and perhaps some mechanisms influence them while they discern and connect the forms and meanings in the input. Therefore, the information in the intake is a subset of the information available in the input, and it may not be correct (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 132;VanPatten, 1996, pp. 13-53;VanPatten, 2004a;VanPatten, 2004b, pp. 5-24).\n\nBecause it is possible that learner´s existing IP behaviors and other mechanisms \"variously support, fail to support, or actively hinder the initial establishment of FMCs,\" CALL software should not be created to accommodate these as would be the case if IP was considered under individualization (VanPatten et al., 2004, p. 12). The accommodation of a deficient or harmful IP behavior would limit or impair the success of the learner in learning the L2.\n\nSimilarly, CALL software programs that ignore the IP of learners would frustrate some learners,\n\nthey would never seem to pick up the L2 or understand what they are doing wrong. Only one option remains for CALL software, and that is to attempt to adjust the learner\"s IP mechanisms like an orthodontist or dental surgeon adjusts, repairs, or replaces teeth.

I divided the data into three periods according to publishing year of the software. I selected the intervals, <1988, 1988 to 1995, and 1996 to 2008, because they represent important shifts in the personal computer (PC) market. Before 1988, personal computer technology was in its infancy relative to 2008. Many computer brands of this period only supported rough graphic detail with 16 or fewer colors and ran software from cassettes or disks. Software that ran from a hard drive was available towards the end of the period. The Apple I and II, Tandy, Commodore, and Amiga 1000 series were popular machines in this period (\"Amiga,\" 2008;\"Apple Inc,\" 2008;\"Commodore 64,\" 2008;\"Commodore 128,\" 2008;\"Commodore Amiga,\" 2008).\n\nFrom 1988 to 1995, the personal computer market boomed and the graphic user interface, which both Apple Inc and the Microsoft Corporation had introduced in the previous period, became standard along with software that ran from a hard drive. The common computers of this period were the PS/2, PowerPC, and various PC compatible brands because of IBM´s open architecture policy of the previous period (\" IBM PC,\" 2008;\"Apple Inc,\" 2008;\"PowerPC,\" 2008). Despite the boom in the domestic PC market, processor speed, memory capacity, and hard disk capacity were expensive and did not increase greatly. Due to the increased potential of computers in the third period, the compilation should show an increase in the depth and density in all categories for the second and third periods, and the changes should be much more noticeable in the third period. As expected, the \"Adjusted Percentage of Data Entries\" column of Table 3.1 does show an increase in the total number of data entries for the second and third periods. The seven percent increase that the second period experienced over the first period in total number of data entries is evidence of the slow growth of PC technology from 1981 to 1995. Additionally, because the growth registered in the second period is all in the individualization category, it indicates that the slow technological growth led to an increased emphasis on differentiating software programs by incorporating individualization features. The negative growth exhibited by the interaction and personalization categories in the first and second periods further emphasizes the slow technological growth occurring at that time.\n\nIn contrast, the 20 percent increase in entries from the second period to the third period is large enough to be consistent with a boom in software potential provided by the explosion in technology during the same period. Perhaps due to pedagogical shifts in the third period, the emphasis on interaction and individualization is more balanced. The extremely small percentage contributed by the personalization column in any period represents an area in need of development. It is especially evident since in the third period there is only an eight percent increase in the importance of personalization. The third period is when the emphasis on the learner and constructivism is the greatest of all three periods.\n\nTo highlight the details of the evolution of CALL software and to reveal areas in need of further evolution according to current technology and pedagogy, I performed a more in depth study of the periods and categories previously overviewed. Appendices B and D show the categories and their attributes and sub-attributes into which I sorted the data from each period.\n\nBecause I want to emphasize the areas (attributes and sub-attributes) in need of changes, I show those areas in Table 3.2, Table 3.3 and Table 3.4. In each table, I rank the listed attributes and sub-attributes according to how their representation in the third period compares with that of the other periods. Then, based on the influence that pedagogy and technology play in each attribute or sub-attribute, I assigned a reason for each observed evolution. Consequently, each table depicts the evolution and reasons for it of one category from 1981 to 2008.\n\nTable 3.2 shows the under-evolved attributes and sub-attributes of the interaction category. The areas are listed along with their respective rank in the third period (P3) and reasons from Appendix B.\n\nAt the top of the list of areas from the interaction category is the attribute \"A Technified\n\nWorkbook.\" This means that the software developers for some CALL software programs have converted traditional grammar workbooks into software programs. Spanish Review, Software for Because interaction should be more than typing and clicking as explained in the interaction section of this paper, CALL software developers should not continue to create \"technified\" workbooks. The sub-attribute \"Interactive\" of \"Approach to Focus on Input\" describes an approach to input that employs technologies and insights from pedagogical research that are more effective.\n\nIn step with interaction is the area of making CALL software more communicative. In the stricter definition of interaction, communication plays the role of keeping interacting learners interested in their respective messages, thereby setting the stage to keep everyone interested in the message they receive. The concept of interacting learners is outside the common paradigm of CALL software as is noticeable in both the interaction and individualization categories.\n\nSimply stated, the learner using current CALL software has no one with whom to interact and scarcely truly interacts with the computer. The CALL software, Aprende español con el hijo de Astérix and Tesoros: Curso Multimedia Interactivo de Español made an inroad into this area by having an avatar, or animated character, teach the learner (Appendix D). However, the avatar concept should be further developed to model the current pedagogical ideal of a facilitator and interacting learners (Lonsdale, Graham, & Madsen, 2006, p. 120). This development could also assist in the area of learners needing to learn something to complete a task. ¡A su salud! Spanish for Health Professionals and Pueblo Ingles of Second Life are amongst a few software programs in the reviews that had the learners complete a task that required them to exercise their new knowledge (Appendix D). Developing this area will give learners a reason to learn the information and keep them interested in interacting.\n\nThe 16 different activity types that I found throughout the software reviews can help keep learners interested in interacting (Appendix D). Some of the basic activity types like binary (e.g. T/F), fill-in-the-blanks, matching, multiple options, and putting-in-order need further development. In the reviews, these activity type questions were output production or comprehension based. The opportunity, therefore, is to provide more input focused questions, so the learner gains more experience with the covered aspect. This way, more information will make its way into the learner\"s intake and then into the developing system. Improving the developing system will help to lessen incorrect output, which as previously discussed, acts to overcome negative learner characteristics like low motivation, debilitating anxiety, and low selfesteem. Some more complex activity types like dialogues, paired conversations, and simulations also should be developed more. Pasos vivos and Español Interactivo 1.01 are a couple of the reviewed CALL software programs that use written and oral dialogues to allow learners to pretend they are interacting with people (Appendix D). The dialogues, however, always have only one correct flow, which involves the memorization of a dialogue between native speakers.\n\nCurrent artificial intelligence and voice recognition technologies allow for a less limiting written or verbal interaction. The learner could even direct the conversation based on his/her initiation of the conversation and his/her responses to the intelligent agent\"s output. CALL software developers could extend this to mimic paired or group conversations. In the reviewed software, paired conversations take place over the telephone or face to face like in ¡A su salud! Spanish for Health Professionals (Appendix D).\n\nIn addition to simulating conversations with artificial intelligences, the learner can now perform both live written and verbal conversations through software and over the Internet. As of 2008, this is even available in the immersion based internet world of Second Life. Second Life is not strictly a CALL environment, but a multi-purpose, multi-user virtual environment hosted by Linden Research, Inc. on various servers. In this virtual environment, users can create their own avatars and virtual worlds or use ones that already exist, such as Pueblo Inglés. Apart from Second Life, the few CALL software programs in the reviews that have virtual environments such as El Mundo Hispanico and Un Misterio en Toluca utilize simpler ones to do simulations (Appendix D). However, Second Life reveals that current technologies allow more complex and feature-rich environments and simulations (Linden Research, Inc, 2008).\n\nDespite a variety of activity types, all of the competencies except grammar need to be developed further in CALL software. Very few reviews of the 44 software titles that make up the compilation mention the software program teaching something besides grammar. This may indicate a limitation on the part of both the software and the reviews. In the third period, videos enhance the capability of teaching the socio-cultural and extra-linguistic competencies, but only 2 (Enredos Interactivos and Second Life) out of 16 software titles intentionally incorporate those competencies in the material and activities (Appendix D). As for the reading and writing competencies, primarily software directed towards intermediate and advanced levels utilized these competencies (Appendix D). However, given the proper scaffolding such as pre-activities and strategy advice, novice language learners can read and respond to authentic or slightly modified authentic material (Hadley, 2001, p. 188-190, 206-207;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 223-238). This will allow novice learners to experience connected discourse and invite them to imitate it in their own responses. Due to technology limitations, only the second and third periods address the speaking competency. With the exception of Second Life, which is not strictly CALL software, the reviewed software primarily includes the speaking competency through dialogue activities that record and compare learner and native speech samples. Let's Talk was the only software program that let the learner verbally interact (not using the strict definition) within the software environment (Appendix D). The learner can verbally choose an answer in multiple-option questions by saying the letter or reading the answer. As indicated in the improving-the-dialogue-activity-type section of this paper, there are many opportunities for development in the speaking competency (Nieves, 1997).\n\nTable 3.3 on the following page shows the under-evolved attributes and sub-attributes of the individualization category. The areas are listed along with their respective rank in the third period and reasons from Appendix B.\n\nThe increase in artificial intelligence technology in the second period caused a spike in the indication and location of errors. Later, shifts in pedagogy towards discovery learning decreased interest in this feedback type, thus the third and first periods were the lowest.\n\nThe feedback type, \"One chance at correct answer,\" should occur less while the feedback type, \"Permit more than one correct answer,\" should be standard. The first type is inconsistent with current movements towards making CALL software more interactive and communicative.\n\nThose two movements very seldom involve obtaining a correct answer or at least not a correct answer immediately. They emphasis processing input in order to do something with the information such as making a value judgment for oneself, which inherently has plural correct answers.\n\nI look forward to seeing more feedback types like \"Replays the multimedia part with the answer but does not indicate the answer.\" This type of feedback is similar to when someone asks for repetition during a conversation, a video or an audio recording. Not only does it imitate a real world event, it also moves feedback into the multimedia era in which \"immediacy skill[s]…can be made to resemble the recursive skill[s]…\" (Joiner 1997, p. 82, as cited in Hadley, 2001, p. 179). Typically, the immediacy skills are listening and speaking, and the recursive skills are reading and writing.\n\nAs explained in the section on individualization, imbedding tools in CALL software is a way to address learners\" learning strategies and learning style dimensions. It is easier to address strategies since there are many style dimensions that map to the same learning strategies. Of the reviewed software only Let's Practice Spanish, Ciberteca: Una carta a Dios, and Enredos Interactivos address learning strategies through tools or otherwise. This number should increase because technology allows the opening of applications such as a note pad with the click of a button. This is also relevant to immersion since the learner often role-plays, explores, or both in a virtual world and needs to find and keep track of linguistic data and other information.\n\nMethodologies not traditionally found in CALL such as Total Physical Response (TPR) should appear more frequently. Live Action Spanish Interactive is the only CALL software in\n\nTable 3.3 Comparison of the Individualization Category Attribute Rank in P3 Reason for P3 standing Feedback Indicates the location of errors (Artificial Intelligence) One chance at correct answer Replays the multimedia part with the answer but does not indicate the answer Permits more than one right answer Immersion (Everything is in L2 and/or realistic environment) Involves culture and/or behavior Learning Style Dimensions Learning Strategies (Appendix A) Modalities involved to create Form-Meaning connections TPR Native vs. Learner voice comparison Offers various learning tracks Pre and/or During activities for listening/reading/writing activities Scaffolding (i.e. sentences to connected discourse) Tie p1 for lowest Tie p1 for highest Only in P3 N/A Highest Highest Highest Highest Only in P3 Highest Tie p2 for lowest Lowest Tie all low Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Inconsistent w/ Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Tech Boom Inconsistent w/ Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Pedagogical Shifts Pedagogical Shifts Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Tech Boom Inconsistent w/ Pedagogical Shifts and Tech Boom Inconsistent w/ Pedagogical Shifts Inconsistent w/ Pedagogical Shifts\n\nthe review that incorporates a non-traditionally-found methodology. It bases its activities on TPR. Therefore, based on the reviews in this compilation, CALL software developers envision the usage of their product as a sit-down-and-be-quiet time for learners. This is inconsistent with oral proficiency and proficiency in the physical (non-verbal) aspects of competencies such as sociolinguistic and strategic (Hadley, 2001, pp. 2-8). Methodologies such as TPR in CALL software can target learning styles and strategies that are more kinesthetic. Additionally, they will enrich the possibilities available to CALL software programs for having the learner respond to information from the input.\n\nAs for the \"Native vs. Learner voice comparison\" attribute, it is possible that comparing learner and native output samples in software programs emphasizes accent, pronunciation and flow more than is pedagogically accepted (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 9-14). The extra emphasis on imitation may be helpful to learners that want to work on certain linguistic characteristics such as pronunciation and accuracy (Hadley, 2001, p. 112). However, language pedagogy now states that focusing on communication and interaction is more important, not to the detriment of pronunciation and precision but to their enhancement (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 132-133). Acceptable L2 linguistic characteristics develop over time. Consequently, for CALL software developers, it would be better to emphasize vocabulary development in a communicative context and interaction through artificial intelligence and voice recognition.\n\nInteraction can provide the feedback necessary to modify linguistic characteristics such as tone, pronunciation, and flow (31)(32)119).\n\nVery few reviews directly or indirectly mentioned scaffolding, the provision of sufficient support structures to promote learning as the learner does the exercises, activities, and tasks the software program presents (Appendix D). Scaffolding should be an essential part of CALL software. Ellis (2003) refers to scaffolding as something that \"creates conditions in which learners can develop awareness of new L2 forms and/or actually produce them\" (199).\n\nVanPatten provides scaffolding in his simple sentence to complex discourse design of structured input. He reasons similarly to Ellis that \"learners process input for form only if their processing resources have not been depleted after they have processed the input for meaning\" (VanPatten, 2004, p. 38). This means the learner should have the support of experience with simpler discourse when trying to process discourse that is more complex.\n\nScaffolding is also applicable to listening, reading, and writing activities in the form of pre-activities, during-activities, and post-activities. These activities help prepare and guide the learner while giving a purpose to the activity other than to listen, to read, or to write (Hadley, 2001, pp 184-188, 204-208, 290-296;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 205-214, 228-240, 247-254).\n\nIn this compilation, only four of the CALL software programs (Spanish Microtutor version 2.0, Recuerdos de Madrid, Enredos Interactivos, and ¡A su salud! Spanish for Health Professionals) have pre-activities, during-activities, or both as part of its listening, reading, or writing activities (Appendix D). Post-activities of the comprehension type were common. The Post-activities could help the learner assimilate information as opposed to checking comprehension if preactivities and during-activities prepared the learner to perform assimilating activities (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 236-240).\n\nTable 3.4 shows the under-evolved attributes and sub-attributes of the personalization category. These areas are listed along with their respective rank in the third period and reasons from Appendix B.\n\nThe personalization category provides the most opportunities for improvement. In fact, all of the attributes had low representations in all of the periods. Because of their focus on the learner, the most important are those that develop personal and social constructions and those that propagate user preferences, previous knowledge, and output into subsequent activities.\n\nThe appearance in the third period of the idea that the learner can build personal and social constructions shows a pedagogical shift to constructivism and the effects of the internet and social connectionist movements. As indicated by the personalization section of this paper, a CALL software program should allow the user to personalize fully his or her CALL experience.\n\nIf CALL software designers do not develop these constructivism areas, learners may not truly\n\nTable 3.4 Comparison of the Personalization Category Attribute Rank in P3 Reason for P3 standing Incorporates Tasks (Pedagogical or Real) Learner builds a personal or social construction to benefit him or herself and others (Personal/Social Constructivism) Learner has options to personalize the software (e.g. options to change types of questions) Professor can control the content or the visible content Utilizes preferences, previous knowledge and output in subsequent activities Highest Only in P3 Highest Highest Only in P3 Pedagogical Shifts Pedagogical Shifts & Tech Boom Pedagogical Shifts Pedagogical Shifts Pedagogical Shifts\n\nincorporate the language into themselves. To the learner, the L2 will remain an academic subject instead of a means of personal expression and social interaction, which for many people extends into personal and social constructions such as Wikipedia.com, Flickr.com, YouTube.com, and blog sites.\n\nOnly two software programs (Pasos vivos and Second Life) out of the 44 I reviewed included the area \"utilizing learner preferences, previous knowledge, and output in activities\".\n\nThere are many possibilities for further development of this area. For example, the software can use the learner to generate content. In addition, the software could modify its own content to match the learner\"s needs and motivations.\n\nInteraction \"Mis vacaciones\" addresses some of the under-evolved areas in the interaction category of the compilation. I use an interactive approach to focusing on input that the reviewed software does not frequently incorporate. I base my approach on Processing Instruction (PI), a methodology developed by VanPatten (1996VanPatten ( , 2004b;;Farley, 2005). In my program when a learner clicks on the UGenio button, structured input (SI) activities appear to assist the learner in acquiring the language needed to perform the task of the selected city. SI activities adjust the input processing strategies of the learner so there is an interaction between the learner and the activity. Another interaction that takes place in \"Mis vacaciones\" is the use of the learner´s choices within the same activity or in other activities. In this way, it maintains the appearance of being interested in its own output and that of the learner.\n\n\"Mis vacaciones\" keeps the learner interested in his/her own output by using communicative tasks (CT) and activities. There is an end of game CT, which presents the purpose of the experience. Each destination also has a CT. To start the game, the learner chooses a destination from a map of Mexico and Central America. For this thesis, only the destination of Nuevo Leon, Nicaragua is available. \"Mis vacaciones\" presents each destination CT to the learner at the entrance to the respective destination. The learner can then decide to do the CT, get help with the CT via SI activities, or go to another destination. In addition to communicative tasks, \"Mis vacaciones\" incorporates SI activities to further address the communicative deficiency found in the reviewed software (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, pp. 142-165;VanPatten 1996VanPatten , 2002)). There are two categories of SI activities: referential and affective.\n\nReferential-SI activities \"are those for which there is a right or wrong answer and for which the learner must rely on the targeted grammatical form to get meaning\" (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 159). Affective-SI activities differ from referential-SI activities in that they do not have right or wrong answers. Instead, they require learners to express an opinion, belief or some other affective response as they are engaged in processing information about the real world\" (Farley, 2005;Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 159;VanPatten, 1996;Wong, 2004, pp. 42-45). Affective-SI activities, therefore, are communicative, but both types are meaning based. In its current form, \"Mis vacaciones\" has one referential-SI and no affective-SI activities although the underlying structure of the software allows for using affective-SI activities. Future versions will incorporate hybrid-SI activities, which are referential-SI and affective -SI activities. In this type of activity, the learner gives a right or wrong answer (that the software program can check) and responds to an affective question about how the content of the referential part applies to him or herself in order to address communicativeness and personalization.\n\nThe use of tasks and SI activities also contributes to another under-evolved area of CALL software: the learner having to learn or understand something to complete an activity. The communicative real world tasks at the city level and at the end of the game require the learner to have understood and learned the presented vocabulary and grammar items. Of course, the software does not force the learner to complete the SI activities if the learner already possesses the required information and completes the tasks. If the learner does the SI activities, these activities keep meaning in focus, which according to VanPatten (1996VanPatten ( , 2002) ) means that the learner \"must successfully process the propositional content of the input in order to successfully complete the activity\" (Farley, 2005;Wong, 2004, p. 38).\n\nIn the area of types of activities, \"Mis vacaciones\" differs from the reviewed software in two ways. Similarly to the reviewed software SI activities allow the use of binary, fill-in-theblanks, matching, multiple-option, and putting-in-order questions. The difference between my approach and the reviewed software is that my questions focus on getting meaning from forms rather than testing the comprehension of a sentence or the conjugation of a verb. The learner acquires information rather than being tested. Finally, as part of the interactive focus on input of \"Mis vacaciones,\" the simulations involved in the software give the learner input from experience instead of from an output-based test.\n\nTo contribute to the speaking competency area, \"Mis vacaciones\" allows the use of speaking in input activities instead of only output activities. SI activities can use speaking as long as the user does not have to use creatively the form-meaning link on which the lesson is concentrating. For example, a learner could read aloud some input to another learner. In this way, some of the SI activities that the learner can do with a partner or group in class are able to improve speaking competency. Depending on the learner, this could be true for individual use as well. The learner can read the input aloud to another learner (the computer) as part of a simulation of pair or group work.\n\nDespite the growth exhibited by the individualization category in Table 3.1 from the first period to the second period and its continued strength in the third period, it still has weak areas.\n\n\"Mis vacaciones\" contributes to the strengthening of three of those areas. In the \"Feedback\" area, current technology allows for many multimedia (video, sound, and images) effects that were not possible before the third period. One in particular stands out for use as feedback.\n\nCALL developers can link multimedia or segments of multimedia to sections of activities.\n\nTraditionally, CALL software plays the multimedia at the beginning of an activity and then requires the learner to respond afterwards. The feedback for the learner\"s responses, typically, has been the same type associated with non-multimedia activities (right, wrong, why, how, and where). \"Mis vacaciones\" contributes to the small number of CALL software programs using multimedia clips in feedback. The multimedia in the feedback is usually all or part of the multimedia clip on which the software bases the activity. However, the developer could utilize a different multimedia clip in a feedback message if the learner is aware of this practice and the different clip is better suited to allow the learner to notice any errors made in the activity, or to confirm what he or she has learned.\n\nAdditionally under the \"Feedback\" area, a limited number of CALL software programs in the review permitted more than one right answer (Appendix D). This attribute is inherent in the affective type of SI activities since the learner must respond to the question with how the information applies to him or herself. Referential-SI activities can also incorporate questions with multiple answers. The communicative tasks of \"Mis vacaciones,\" by their nature, allow for more than one right answer.\n\n\"Mis vacaciones\" strengthens the learning strategies area by including tools that allow the learner to expand beyond the cognitive learning strategy category to which many of the CALL software programs in the review restrain the learner. Appendix C shows diagrams of learning strategy categories, sub-categories, and example strategies (Ehrman & Oxford, 1990). \"Mis vacaciones\" allows the learner to make use of memory, cognitive, comprehension, metacognitive, affective, and social strategies. I list in Table 4.1 the sub-categories that my program allows and the tools that permit their use.\n\nAs mentioned in Table 3.3, my CALL software program also contributes to the areas \"various learning tracks\" and \"scaffolding.\" Scaffolding is inherent in SI activities as VanPatten defines them (1996,2002). One of his guidelines for creating SI activities is moving from simple sentences to connected discourse. Another is focusing on one grammatical form/function at a time (Wong, 2004, p. 38).\n\nTable 4.1 Learning Strategy Types that My CALL Software Program Allows Sub-Categories Tool(s) that allow for strategies of this type Memory Creating mental linkages SI activities, Cognitive Mapping Applying images and sounds Image and Drawing tools Cognitive Practicing Receiving and sending messages Pair/Group work, Tasks Analyzing and reasoning SI activities, Cognitive Mapping Creating structure for input & output Pre activities, Cognitive Mapping, Image Tools Comprehension Guessing intelligently Overcoming limitation in speaking and writing Meta-cognitive Centering your learning Arranging and planning your learning Evaluating your learning Affective Lower your anxiety Social Cooperating with others Empathizing with others SI activities Links to external resources SI activities, Cognitive Mapping Various paths, Scaffolding, Tasks, SI activities Tasks SI activities Pair/Group work, Links to external resources Culture of unit, Links to external resources\n\nPersonalization is like a third world category, under-privileged when compared to the interaction and individualization categories. \"Mis vacaciones\" addresses most of the underdeveloped areas in the personalization category. The learner develops his/her own way of completing the tasks in \"Mis vacaciones\". The tools mentioned in individualization help the learner prepare for and complete the tasks. For example, the learner could use a cognitive map as a reminder in the end game task, which is to converse with a friend about the virtual vacation the learner took. The cognitive map is also a personal construction, which is another area in need of development. Other personal constructions the learner can make are drawings, images, and sequences of images.\n\nThe SI activities have the learner do something with the information gleaned from the input. In fact, one of the guidelines of SI activities is that the learner has to do something with the information from the input (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 158;VanPatten, 1996VanPatten, , 2002;;Wong, 2004, p. 40).\n\n\"Mis vacaciones\" enables the learner and the teacher to do something with its content.\n\nThey can personalize the software through preferences, previous knowledge, and output. As mentioned before, \"Mis vacaciones\" demonstrates that the learner\"s choices in previous activities can be carried into subsequent activities. Any teacher is also able to upload his/her own content including images and activities. This allows any teacher to modify the program\"s content and add additional destinations.\n\nAs has been stated in this paper, CALL software is the weakest link in the language teaching system (LTS) because of its lack of progress in the areas of interaction, individualization, and personalization. Making the improvements in these areas will turn CALL software into a truly interactive, individualized, and personalizable environment. Presently, CALL is like a sandbox with a few tools with which to enjoy the sandbox experience (learning and acquiring). Most of the tools follow old sandbox experience theory. There are some new tools like voice recognition that show promise to break into newer sandbox experience theory.\n\nPerhaps the question that needs to be asked is why CALL learners are still playing in a sandbox. program that CALL should be a three-dimensional wet concrete shape. This concrete playshape should allow the learner to immerse him or herself, swim around, and build deep caverns as well as surface structures. It should allow the learner to sculpt and build constructs and constructions without them losing their shape even when they are dry because the concrete is interested in its response (message) to the learners touch (input). The environment/situation is important to concrete because it needs certain conditions to maintain its properties (interaction). The concrete playshape should also be able to link to the playshapes of friends or strangers (interaction, personalization by social data). There should be tools with which learners can interact with imaginary friends (simulate group/pair work). Learners and teachers (when the concrete playshape is used with supervision), should have tools to change the properties and content of the concrete mix (individualization and personalization). Developers of concrete playshapes should also provide tools for the learner to express different learning styles and to work on a variety of competencies because not all learners are kinesthetic learners (individualization). The concrete playshape should have the learner interact with what he/she has already built while in the process of playing (learning/acquiring) (personalization by PPkO). Finally, the concrete should have sufficient fortification with nutrients (input processing modification activities) to modify the learners input processing behaviors (personalization by IP) so that the learner can take full advantage of playtime.\n\nTable B.2 Interaction Category From All Periods Part 2 Row Labels Entries in Data Number of Software Titles in each Range Range Entries (RE) / Range Software Titles (RT) Percentage of Data Entries in respective category Number of Entries If Each Range had the Same # (44/3) of Titles (using the same RE/RT ratio) Adjusted Percentage of Data Entries Rank Amongst the Three Periods 1988-1995 102 10 10.20 19.77% 149.63 29.00% Interaction 39 3.90 38.24% 57.21 38.24% Approach to Focus on Input 2 0.20 5.13% 2.93 5.13% Interactive 2 0.20 100.00% 2.93 100.00% Tie p1 Lowest Types of Activities 22 2.20 56.41% 32.27 56.41% Binary (i.e. T/F) 1 0.10 4.55% 1.47 4.55% Tie p1 Lowest Dialogues 2 0.20 9.09% 2.93 9.09% Lowest Fill-in-the-blanks 5 0.50 22.73% 7.34 22.73% Middle Games and puzzles 2 0.20 9.09% 2.93 9.09% Lowest Listening 2 0.20 9.09% 2.93 9.09% Lowest Looking 1 0.10 4.55% 1.47 4.55% Tie p1 Highest Matching 1 0.10 4.55% 1.47 4.55% Tie p1 Lowest Multiple Options 4 0.40 18.18% 5.87 18.18% Lowest Putting in Order 1 0.10 4.55% 1.47 4.55% Tie p1 Lowest Short Answer 2 0.20 9.09% 2.93 9.09% Middle Translating 1 0.10 4.55% 1.47 4.55% Lowest Works on these competencies 15 1.50 38.46% 22.01 38.46% General grammar/vocab 7 0.70 46.67% 10.27 46.67% Middle Listening comprehension 3 0.30 20.00% 4.40 20.00% Middle Reading 3 0.30 20.00% 4.40 20.00% Middle Speaking 2 0.20 13.33% 2.93 13.33% Lowest Table B.3 Interaction Category From All Periods Part 3 Row Labels Entries in Data Number of Software Titles in each Range Range Entries (RE) / Range Software Titles (RT) Percentage of Data Entries Number of Entries If Each Range had the Same # (44/3) of Titles (using the same RE/RT ratio) Adjusted Percentage of Data Entries Rank Amongst the Three Periods >1996 274 16 17.13 53.10% 251.22 48.69% Interaction 115 7.19 41.97% 105.44 41.97% A Technified workbook 3 0.19 2.61% 2.75 2.61% Lowest Approach to Focus on Input 6 0.38 5.22% 5.50 5.22% Interactive 6 0.38 100.00% 5.50 100.00% Highest Communicative 7 0.44 6.09% 6.42 6.09% Highest Software or Learner utilizes an avatar or cartoon figure 2 0.13 1.74% 1.83 1.74% The Only One The learner needs to learn/understand to complete a task 5 0.31 4.35% 4.58 4.35% The Only One Types of Activities 52 3.25 45.22% 47.68 45.22% Binary (i.e. T/F) 3 0.19 5.77% 2.75 5.77% Highest Dialogues 3 0.19 5.77% 2.75 5.77% Highest Fill-in-the-blanks 6 0.38 11.54% 5.50 11.54% Lowest Games and puzzles 4 0.25 7.69% 3.67 7.69% Tie p1 Highest Listening 4 0.25 7.69% 3.67 7.69% Highest Long Answer 3 0.19 5.77% 2.75 5.77% The Only One Looking 1 0.06 1.92% 0.92 1.92% Tie p2 Highest Matching 5 0.31 9.62% 4.58 9.62% Highest Multiple Options 9 0.56 17.31% 8.25 17.31% Middle Paired conversations 1 0.06 1.92% 0.92 1.92% The Only One Putting in Order 4 0.25 7.69% 3.67 7.69% Highest Search for text with answer 1 0.06 1.92% 0.92 1.92% The Only One Short Answer 6 0.38 11.54% 5.50 11.54% Highest Simulations 2 0.13 3.85% 1.83 3.85% Highest Works on these competencies 40 2.50 34.78% 36.68 34.78% Extra-linguistic 2 0.13 5.00% 1.83 5.00% The Only One General grammar/vocab 5 0.31 12.50% 4.58 12.50% Lowest Listening comprehension 11 0.69 27.50% 10.09 27.50% Highest Reading 7 0.44 17.50% 6.42 17.50% Highest Socio-cultural 2 0.13 5.00% 1.83 5.00% Highest Speaking 7 0.44 17.50% 6.42 17.50% Highest Writing 6 0.38 15.00% 5.50 15.00% The Only One\n\nTable B.4 Individualization Category From All Periods Part 1 Row Labels Entries in Data Number of Software Titles in each Range Range Entries (RE) / Range Software Titles (RT) Percentage of Data Entries in respective category Number of Entries If Each Range had the Same # (44/3) of Titles (using the same RE/RT ratio) Adjusted Percentage of Data Entries Rank Amongst the Three Periods <1988 140 18 7.78 27.13% 114.10 22.11% Individualization 61 3.39 43.57% 49.72 43.57% Additional Practice available if student wants/needs 3 0.17 4.92% 2.45 4.92% Lowest Approach to Focus on Input 13 0.72 21.31% 10.60 21.31% Comprensible 1 0.06 7.69% 0.82 7.69% Lowest Contextualized 8 0.44 61.54% 6.52 61.54% Lowest Frequency 1 0.06 7.69% 0.82 7.69% The Only One Functional-notional 2 0.11 15.38% 1.63 15.38% The Only One Morphological 1 0.06 7.69% 0.82 7.69% The Only One Feedback 19 1.06 31.15% 15.49 31.15% Automatic Correction 1 0.06 5.26% 0.82 5.26% Lowest Detailed feedback; Tells why 2 0.11 10.53% 1.63 10.53% Highest General Feedback \"Check Spelling\" or meta-linguistic feedback 2 0.11 10.53% 1.63 10.53% Tie p3 Indicates the location of errors (Artificial Inteligence) 1 0.06 5.26% 0.82 5.26% Tie p3 Lowest One chance at correct answer 4 0.22 21.05% 3.26 21.05% Tie p1 Highest Permits more than one right answer 4 0.22 21.05% 3.26 21.05% Highest Score Information (ej.

To go to a location, click on the location\"s green dot. This allows a user to select his or her learning path. A teacher can visit select locations and differentiate or individualize the lesson by charting certain paths during class time. The user can modify the xml document (slideshow_r.xml shown in Figure E.2) that controls what locations \"Mis vacaciones\" offers. When the user clicks on a location (green dot), the main section will show the task(s) designated by the xml document. Figure E.4 shows the task for Nuevo León de León, Nicaragua. To go to the next frame, the user can click on the forward arrow in the upper right corner of the main section. The next frame could be another task. The option of offering more than one task provides another opportunity for differentiation and/or individualization. To   a Figure E.5 A View of the Introduction of the Camera Feature. Camera Visor Camera Button and size options r t e user selects a different size from the size selectors to the right of the camera button. When the user takes a picture, it will appear in the \"Mis Fotos\" column to the right of the main section. To deactivate the camera visor, the user clicks on the camera button again. The task(s) for a location does (do) not have to utilize the camera feature. However, as an example of utilizing the camera feature, the CI section for Nuevo León contains a drawing application (Figure E.6) so that the user can design a caricature while preparing for the task. The drawing and photos are also examples of the user creating personal constructions. The slideshow_r.xml document (shown in Figure E.2) allows the teacher to link swf files (applications) as well as pictures and text into \"Mis vacaciones\". As with the drawing application, when the user encounters applications for photos, the user can drag and drop copies of the photos from the \"Mis Fotos\" storage section. The user can also move an already-dropped photo by clicking and dragging it again. If the user wants to delete photos from the lesson area, the user should drag and drop them over the \"Mis Fotos\" storage area. \"wordreference.com\". This is a link to http://www.wordreference.com; a website external to \"Mis vacaciones\". The purpose of this link is to show the ability of CALL software to link to external sources in order to provide the user with help. Wordreference.com offers a multilingual dictionary, thesaurus, and language forum with options for pronunciation, image, and contextual output. The user can choose the type of output that they desire. It can provide output in the user\"s language (L1) and in the target language (L2). The forum section allows the user to ask questions about the target language using L1 or L2. Responses to questions are from wordreference.com users from around the world. The diversity of the users helps to ensure that the CALL user receives input rich in L2 grammar and socio-cultural usage information.\n\nConsequently, by incorporating this external link, \"Mis vacaciones\" provides the user with multimodal support and interaction opportunities.\n\n*Number of entries if each time period had the same number (44/3) of software titles.
