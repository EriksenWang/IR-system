    "abstract": "In the nonlinear analysis of elastic structures, the displacement increments generated at each incremental step can be decomposed into two components as the rigid displacements and natural deformations. Based on the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, the geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] is derived for a 3D rigid beam element from the virtual work equation using a rigid displacement field. Further, by treating the three-node triangular plate element (TPE) as the composition of three rigid beams lying along the three sides, the [k g ] matrix for the TPE can be assembled from those of the rigid beams. The idea for the UL-type incremental-iterative nonlinear analysis is that if the rigid rotation effects are fully taken into account at each stage of analysis, then the remaining effects of natural deformations can be treated using the small-deformation linearized theory. The present approach is featured by the fact that the formulation is simple, the expressions are explicit, and all member actions are considered in the stiffness matrices. The robustness of the procedure has been demonstrated in the solution of several problems involving the postbuckling response in previous papers by the author.",
    "full_text": "In the past half a century, great advances have been made in nonlinear structural analysis. A partial review of related previous works can be found in Ref. [1], in which a total of 122 papers up to 2002 were cited. Based on the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, the purpose of this paper is to present a conceptually simple, but procedurally robust, incremental-iterative approach for the nonlinear analysis of elastic structures, by taking advantage of the different properties of each phase of the analysis [2,3].\n\nFor an incremental-iterative nonlinear analysis, two typical phases can be identified, i.e., the predictor and corrector phases. The predictor relates to solution of the structural displacement increments for given load increments based on the incremental structural equation, and the corrector is concerned with recovery of the force increments from the displacement increments for each element and the updating of the element forces [4]. The predictor affects only the speed of convergence of iteration, which therefore is allowed to be approximate to the extent that the direction of iteration is not midguided. In contrast, the corrector governs primarily the accuracy of solution, which should thus be made as accurate as possible. A common understanding is that if the corrector is not accurate anough, then the unbalanced forces calculated will be incorrect and the iterations performed to remove the unbalanced forces will be meaningless.\n\nIn nonlinear analysis of structures, we are faced with solution of equations of equilibrium of the incremental form, as given below:\n\nwhere [K] is the tangent stiffness matrix, {Δ U} the displacement increments to be solved, and {Δ P} the load increments applied on the structure for the current incremental step. As for the incremental-iterative analysis, a schematic diagram of the mechanism involved is given in Figure 1. The slope ab represents the tangent stiffness of the structure used in the predictor for computing the displacement increments {Δ U}, given the load increment {Δ P} = { 2 P} -{ 1 P}. Clearly, a convergent solution can always be obtained, regardless of whether the stiffness matrix (i.e., the slope) is updated or not, as indicated in the figure. In fact, this phase affects only the direction of iteration or the number of iterations, but not the accuracy of solution.\n\nIn Figure 1, the segment cd represents the initial forces existing on each element, de the force increments generated during the increment, and be the unbalanced forces. Both the updating of initial forces, as represented by segment de, and the calculation of force increments, as represented by segment be, are part of the corrector phase. Clearly, the corrector must be accurate enough for the unbalanced forces to be correct. This is the logistics for performing an efficient incremental-iterative nonlinear analysis.\n\nThe rigid body rule is an important property that should be obeyed at all times in an incremental-iterative analysis, especially in the predictor and corrector phases. This rule requires that all the initial forces acting on an element should remain unchanged in magnitude and rotate following the rigid rotation. The result is the preservation of equilibrium of the element in the rotated position, as illustrated in Figure 2 [5,6].\n\nBased on the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, the virtual work equation for a finite element at C 2 but with reference to C 1 can be given in a linearized sense as [6]:\n\nin which the first and second terms denote the strain energy and potential energy, respectively, V = volume, C ijkl = constitutive coefficients, and 1 ij  = Cauchy stresses of the element at C 1 ,  = variation of the quantity following, and 1 e ij and 1 ij  = linear and nonlinear components of the strain increments with reference to C 1 ,\n\nwhere u i = displacement increments and x i = coordinates of the element at C 1 . The external virtual works 2 1 R and 1 1 R at C 2 and C 1 , respectively, can be related to the nodal loads  \n\nFor a 3D beam element (Figure 3), the virtual work equation in Eq. ( 2) can be transformed into an incremental stiffness equation for the element from\n\nwhere {u} = displacement increments of the element. The linear stiffness matrix [k e ] and geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] can be derived as\n\nBy assembling Eq. ( 5) over all elements of a structure, we can obtain the structural equation as given in Eq. ( 1).\n\nIn this study, we shall highlight that by choosing a robust incremental-iterative scheme, the use of the linear stiffness matrix [k e ], plus a rigid-body qualified geometric stiffness matrix [k g ], is sufficient for solving a wide range of nonlinear problems.\n\nThe displacements {u} of each element of a structure in each incremental step can be decomposed into two parts as the natural deformations {u} n and rigid displacements {u} r . In general, the rigid displacements constitute a great portion of the incremental displacements of each element (which are initially stressed) of the structure. In comparison, the magnitude of the natural deformations is relatively small for structures that are represented by a sufficient number of elements. Such a characteristic can be appreciated from the buckling of the cantilever shown in Figure 4.\n\nFor a rigid displacement field, the axial, twisting, and rotational displacements are constant, and the lateral displacements are linear, subjected to the constraints for the two ends that make the beam behave as a rigid or non-deformable body [2,3]. For this case, the strain energy in Eq. (6a) simply vanishes, i.e., 0 U   . One can derive from the potential energy term in Eq. (6b) a geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] that is fully compatible with the rigid body rule. In Refs. [2,3], such a geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] has been referred to as the stiffness matrix for the rigid beam element. One advantage with such an element is that it can be derived in a easy way and given in explicit form, while all member actions are duly taken into account.\n\nFor the three-node triangular plate element (TPE) shown in Figure 5, there are three translational and three rotational DOFs at each node, thereby making each side of the element compatible with the 12-DOF beam element derived above. As far as the rigid body behavior of an element is concerned, only the initial forces acting on the element and the external shape of the element need to be considered. The elastic properties that are essential to the deformation of the element, such as Yo u n g ' s mo d u lus, cross-sectional area and moments of Figure 5: Three-node triangular plate element Figure 6: Forces and moments acting on each element\n\ninertia, can be totally ignored. Based on such an idea, the rigid behavior of the TPE can be simulated as if it is composed of three rigid beams lying along the three sides of the element, as shown in Figure 6. It is by this concept that the geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] for the rigid TPE was derived [3], which also appears to be explicit in form.\n\nAs was pointed out previously, the structural stiffness matrix [K] used in the predictor need not be exact and can be approximate in some sense, but must be accurate enough not to misguide the direction of iteration [7]. Such a point allows us to be released from the burden of deriving highly nonlinear elements, as conventionally attempted. It has been demonstrated in Refs. [2,3] that all we need for the predictor of an incremental-iterative analysis is the linear stiffness matrix [k e ], made available from the linear theory, and the geometric stiffness matrix [k g ] derived for the rigid element, for its qualification by the rigid body rule.\n\nThe corrector is concerned with recovery of the force increments {f} from the displacement increments {u} for each element and the updating of element forces at the end of the incremental step. For the case where each incremental step can be regarded as small, which is the case encountered by most nonlinear analysis, the element force increments {f} can be computed with a sufficient level of accuracy using only the linear stiffness matrix [k e ], and the initial nodal forces { 1 f} can be updated using the rigid body rule mentioned above. Clearly, the amount of computation involved in this phase is greatly reduced compared with the conventional approaches.\n\nWe have demonstrated that the geometric stiffness matrices can be derived for the 3D rigid beam element and rigid triangular plate element (TPE). It should be noted that in assembling the element stiffness matrices to form the structural matrix, joint equilibrium conditions should be established in the rotated position, as was described in Refs. [3,6], to account the effect of nodal moments undergoing rotations. In solving the postbuckling behaviors of structures using the prediction/corrector concept presented above, along with the rigid element and rigid body rule, it is essential that a reliable solution scheme be used. The scheme that has been demonstrated to be quite powerful is the generalized displacement control (GDC) method proposed in Ref. [8]. The applicability of the present procedure has been demonstrated in the solution of a number of nonlinear problems [2,3]."
