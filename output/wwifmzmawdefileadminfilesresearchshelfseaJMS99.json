    "abstract": "This model study investigates the role of Siberian river runoff for the transport of possible river contaminants in the Arctic Ocean. Three-dimensional coupled ice-ocean-models of different horizontal resolution are applied to simulate the dispersion of river water from Ob, Yenisei and Lena. These Siberian rivers are supposed to be important sources for various contaminants. The relevant processes which are considered in this study include the dispersion of dissolved or suspended contaminants in the water column and the transport of contaminated particles, incorporated into drifting sea ice.\nCirculation model results from both spatial scales explain the main pathways and transit times of Siberian river water in the Arctic Ocean. Kara Sea river water clearly dominates in the Siberian branch of the Transpolar Drift, while the Lena water dominates in the Canadian branch. River water concentrations in Nares Strait, Canadian Archipelago, are similar to those in the northern Fram Strait. Special emphasis is given to the seasonal variability of the river plume in the Kara Sea. Particle tracking simulations on the regional scale illustrate that Ob and Yenisei tracers behave differently. Yenisei tracers leave the Kara Sea quite fast towards the Arctic Ocean or the Laptev Sea, but Ob tracers spread also in the southern Kara Sea, in particular at lower levels.\nA comparison of simulated freezing rates and particle concentrations in Siberian coastal waters suggests that during autumn, the incorporation of particles into freezing sea ice near the estuaries of Ob and Yenisei is very likely. Simulated ice trajectories, started close to the Lena river delta easily reach the multi-year Transpolar Drift within one winter. Ice trajectories from Ob and Yenisei estuaries, however, mostly drift towards the Barents Sea where the ice melts close to Svalbard. The model study confirms that contaminant transport through sediment-laden sea ice offers a short and effective pathway for pollutant transport from Siberian rivers to the Barents and Nordic Seas.",

Two model domains were considered: a large scale model of the Arctic Ocean and a regional scale model for the shelves of the Kara Sea. The models differ in their numerical and physical approach; however, both models use the same meteorological forcing data. The forcing data consist of climatological monthly mean atmospheric data.\n\nFollowing an introduction of relevant processes and pathways, Section 2 is dedicated to regional scale dispersion studies in the Kara Sea, where the Ob and Yenisei estuaries are located. Section 3 describes the fate of river water on the large scale domain, i.e. the whole Arctic Ocean and the northern North Atlantic. Section 4 combines both scales by investigating the possibility of sediment or particulate matter transport by sea ice. Finally, Section 5 summarises our findings with respect to Arctic river contaminants.\n\nThe Arctic rivers Ob, Yenisei and Lena drain huge land areas in Siberia and Russia. They gather large amounts of water and particulate material and transport them over long distances. The rivers are supposed to be key sources for various contaminants. The catchment areas include many diffuse sources such as agricultural runoff loaded with pesticides. Discharges of municipal and industrial sewage from heavily populated and industrialised areas south of the Arctic contribute to the contamination load. Other polluting activities are mining and oil and gas exploitation. Two nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, Mayak and Tomsk, enter the drainage areas of the Ob, the third one, Krasnoyarsk, goes directly into the Ž . Yenisei AMAP, 1998;NATO, 1998 . In general, contaminants in the marine environment have to be divided into two classes: dissolved contaminants, i.e. substances which are redistributed by the flow field more or less passively, and particles or particle reactive substances which tend to attach to particles or suspended material in the water column. Most of the pollutants of concern are in fact particle-reactive like heavy metals such as lead, iron, copper and cadmium, organochlorides like PCBs and Ž DDTs and certain radionuclides Pfirman et al., . 1995 .\n\nThe total annual amount of freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean by Ob, Yenisei and Lena equals roughly 3\n\n. 1500 km ryear Fig. 1 of which 80% is discharged Ž .Ž . in spring May-June Pavlov and Pfirman, 1995 . This results in peak discharge rates of more than 3\n\n. 100,000 m rs e.g. Yenisei . The strong seasonal variance in freshwater runoff influences the input of dissolved and particulate matter from the rivers. The peak release of suspended matter by the rivers might even be more pronounced than the freshwater signal itself because the spring break-up of river ice is Ž . usually a very turbulent event Pfirman et al., 1995 . In total, the Arctic rivers carry about 221 million tons of sediment per year into the Arctic Ocean of which Ob and Yenisei alone deliver 22.4 million Ž . tons into the Kara Sea AMAP, 1998 .\n\nThe Arctic Ocean interior is characterised by a strong vertical haline stratification. Due to its low density, the major portion of the inflowing river water from the shelves stays in the upper tens of meters. Dissolved contaminants may reach deeper water layers only through vertical mixing or convective overturning in well-mixed shelf areas. The situation is different for particle bound contaminants. Up to 90% of the suspended organic matter settle in the estuaries in contrast to 20-40% of riverine dissolved Ž . organic components Stein, 1989 . The particles may be resuspended due to strong bottom currents or even due to convection. Upward transport of particles in the water column makes them available for Ž . further dispersion Schlosser et al., 1995 . Sea ice plays a special role in the transport of Ž . contaminants in the Arctic Pfirman et al., 1995 . The ice gathers material from the atmosphere, by overflowing river water in spring or through freezing Ž .Ž . of bottom sediments Aanchor iceB AMAP, 1998 . A frequently described process is the incorporation of sediments or particles during ice formation. The coastal areas of the Arctic Shelves are characterised by recurrent open water between fast and drifting ice, which are driven by offshore winds. These Aflaw leadsB produce large amounts of new ice through the Ž mechanism of leeward advection Martin and Cava-. lieri, 1989;Dethleff et al, 1998b . Turbulent mixing and thermohaline convection enhance resuspension of fine-grained material. Through the process of Asuspension freezingB, material will be filtered out of the water column and incorporated into the newly Ž formed grease ice Reimnitz et al., 1993;Dethleff et . al., 1994 . Considerable amounts of sediment or particulate material is exported from shallow Siberian Shelves by the Transpolar Ice Drift towards Fram Strait Ž . Nurnberg et al., 1994 . Once incorporated into the ïce cover, the potentially contaminated material will join the Transpolar Drift and may enter the northern North Atlantic. The Arctic sea ice melts most extensively in the Greenland Sea, along the marginal ice zones. Because this is usually a region of intense biological activity, the pollutants which are released directly into surface waters may easily enter the food chain. Moreover, the melt period often coincides with the spring bloom of biological activity, increasing the potential for biological uptake of contaminants. The transport of particulate material by sea ice may therefore play an important role in long-range redistribution of contaminants in the Arctic and North Ž . Atlantic Pfirman et al., 1995 .\n\nThe regional scale studies are focussed on the Kara Sea, in particular on the river runoff from Ob Ž . and Yenisei c.f. Fig. 1 . The used Kara Sea Model is described only very briefly. A detailed description The Kara Sea Model is forced with daily mean meteorological data which is interpolated from a monthly mean climatological ECMWF 2 -data set ŽTrenberth et al., 1989;Aukrust and Oberhuber, . 1995 . The wind stress at the ice or water surface follows a second order approach using different wind drag coefficients for water and ice. Surface heat fluxes at the ocean-ice-atmosphere interfaces are calculated on the basis of air temperature, cloud cover and relative humidity with standard bulk for-Ž . mulae Maykut, 1986 . The oceanic gain and loss of heat is used to determine the sea surface temperature which in turn affects the ice formation and salt fluxes.\n\nThe model accounts for the dominant M -tidal 2 constituent. The Barents Sea inflow through the Kara 2 ECMWF: European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast, Reading, UK. Strait is of major importance because it brings heat and salt into the Kara Sea. To account for these effects, the net in-or outflow is prescribed as 10-day mean volume fluxes. The maximum transport rate into the Kara Sea is 0.65 Sv during the first half of January. In summer, when northerly winds prevail, the inflow is reduced, showing a slight net outflow Ž . y0.07 Sv towards the Barents Sea in July and August. The mean inflow averaged over one year is 0.3 Sv. This is in good agreement with measure-Ž . ments Pavlov and Pfirman, 1995 . River runoff rates from Ob, Yenisei and Pyasina are prescribed as 10-day mean volume fluxes in 3\n\n. m rs Fig. 2 . The Ob tributaries, Taz and Pur, are included in the Ob runoff. The salinity of the rivers, at the point where they enter the model domain, was set to 5 psu whereas the temperature was prescribed depending on the season. Highest river temperature in August was set to 3.88C, the lowest during winter Ž . at the freezing point y0.38C .\n\nA three-dimensional advection scheme based on the advection-diffusion transport equation is applied in order to treat the salinity and water temperature as a free AprognosticB variable that is not constrained by given data. The same Eulerian transport algorithm is used for passive tracers. Like for temperatures and Ž salinity, the vertical diffusion of matter i.e. the . vertical eddy diffusivity coefficient depends on Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 99 stratification and vertical current shear. Horizontal eddy diffusion is neglected because of numerical diffusion stemming from the advection scheme. A Langrangian transport routine is used for particle tracking of passive tracers in river water. In this routine, horizontal diffusion is parameterised through the Monte Carlo method which implies a random walk of particles.\n\nThe applied meteorological ECMWF data set describes a cyclic, climatological year. This forcing is used to generate a cyclic stationary flow field that reproduces the seasonal variability of circulation and hydrography in the Kara Sea. The cyclic stationary state is reached after approximately 3 years spin-up time.\n\nThe most dominant feature of the simulated climatological year is a pronounced seasonal variability of currents and hydrography, caused by the wind field, the freshwater runoff and the ice formation. There is no typical 'Kara Sea circulation' that prevails throughout the year. Our recently obtained circulation fields have led to a revised view of the AclassicalB Kara Sea circulation presented by, e.g. Ž .\n\nŽ . Pavlov et al. 1993 or Pavlov andPfirman 1995 . This holds in particular for a frequently cited cyclonic current structure in the southern Kara Sea which was not supported either by our model simula-Ž . tions nor by observations Krosshavn et al., 1998 . Based on recent model results, two circulation Ž . schemes were identified Harms and Karcher, 1999\n\nThe spring and summer situation Fig. 3a is characterised by weak anticyclonic wind fields and strong river runoff. The dominating wind direction is from north to north-east. The general circulation pattern in the Kara Sea is anticyclonic with strong currents very close to the river estuaries. ( ) I.H. Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 100 a general flushing from south-west to north-east.\n\nStrong cyclonic winds from south-west and a large extent of the river plume cause a very pronounced coastal current at the Siberian coast.\n\nIt has to be mentioned, that this description is strongly simplified. However, these two circulation schemes explain most of the seasonal variability in river tracer dispersion.\n\nThe dispersion of river water in the Kara Sea is studied with tracer concentrations, using the Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. Based on the cyclic stationary flow field, the river water is initialised w x with a 100 % concentration whereas the ambient w x Kara Sea is initialised with 0 % concentration. The dispersion of the river water was traced for 8 years, until a cyclic stationary state was achieved.\n\nThe shape and extent of the surface river plume is depicted in Fig. 4. In spite of strong variability in river runoff rates and wind forcing, the seasonal variation in the extent of the plume is surprisingly small. Even in winter, when runoff rates are very low, the area with a river water fraction exceeding 5% is roughly comparable to the summer situation. However, looking at higher percentage rates of river water in the Kara Sea, seasonal differences become more obvious. Significant seasonal variability is visible north of the estuaries where the area of river water fraction exceeding 50% is much broader in summer than in winter.\n\nThe surface river plume is also quite variable in the north-east of the Kara Sea where the export of river water takes place. The export is high in autumn and winter, when the river water forms an eastward flowing coastal current along the Siberian shore. In that time of the year, most of the river water leave Ž the Kara Sea through the eastern open boundary i.e.\n\n. the Vilkitzky Strait to the Laptev Sea. In spring and summer, however, the export through Vilkitzky Strait decreases significantly. It is even blocked in July and August when north-easterly winds drive an inflow from the Laptev Sea into the Kara Sea. During these months, the eastern part of the river plume is de- tached from the Siberian coast and most of the river water export goes through the northern boundary, between Novaya Semlya and Severnaya Semlya, towards the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe freshwater from the rivers produces a very pronounced haline stratification that can be observed in late summerrautumn when the freshwater plume has its largest extent. Vertical density gradients in Ž . this area Fig. 5 are most pronounced in the upper 50 m causing strong baroclinic pressure gradients Ž . Harms and Karcher, 1999 . This stratification influences not only the circulation but also the vertical exchange of water masses and other dissolved substances. The surface circulation is partly uncoupled from the flow at lower levels which affects the drift of river tracers at different depth horizons. This effect is demonstrated in the following section.\n\nCirculation modelling of the Kara Sea shows that the seasonal variability of currents in the Ob or Ž Yenisei estuary is quite large Harms and Karcher, . 1999 . The current speeds are highest during spring and summer when the runoff is large and decrease significantly in autumn and winter. There is also a strong variability in current directions in the estuaries. Whereas in spring the currents are directed north-westward into the central Kara Sea, the late summer currents in the estuaries point to eastward directions.\n\nThe influence of seasonally varying currents and runoff rates on the time-dependent evolution of river water dispersion in the Kara Sea is studied with particle tracking methods. Passive tracers were continuously released in different depth horizons in the Ob or Yenisei estuary, mainly during peak runoff Ž . MayrJunerJuly .\n\nOur results show, that the tracer dispersion depends very much on the tracer depth. Comparing the particle clouds of Ob and Yenisei against each other, it is obvious that at the surface, both river tracers Ž . behave quite similarly Fig. 6, left and right . In both river esturies, the spring tracer dispersion is directed mainly north-westward into the central Kara Sea. Some Ob tracers even go westward and reach the west coast of the Yamal peninsula. From Augustr September onward, the wind directions change and the tracers turn eastward. At this stage, however, large parts of the particle cloud have already reached the central Kara Sea. In the following months, the At lower levels, the tracer dispersion but also the resulting transit times show significant differences between Ob and Yenisei. Whereas large parts of surface river tracers usually need less than 1 year to leave the model domain, lower level tracers might circulate for several years in the central Kara Sea Ž . tracers that spread to a large extent in the southwestern Kara Sea. This is definitely not the case for Yenisei tracers at the same depth level. These tracers Ž . leave the region quite fast -2 years mainly through Vilkitzky Strait towards the Laptev Sea.\n\nA validation of the simulated river tracer dispersion is difficult, first of all because direct observations are scarce or unpublished, and secondly because the application of climatological forcing fields in prognostic model simulations leads to 'artificial' results that do not reflect a real or observed situation. Concerning the Kara Sea circulation, we found very good agreement between our model results and Ž available observations in several areas Harms and . Karcher, 1999 . In particular, laboratory modelling results seem to support the numerical circulation Ž . results in several points McClimans, 1997 . An important model result is the 'straight-lined' dispersion of the spring freshwater signal from Ob and Yenisei to the north-west, into the central Kara Sea. This contradicts the classical view of estuarine processes in the northern hemisphere which implies a more or less strong deflection to the right. The reason for this untypical intrusion is the considerable intensity of the runoff during spring but also the corresponding wind field. When we compared these model results with historical and recent observations, we found good agreement between both. A significant dispersion of river water to the north-west has Ž . already been suggested by Nansen 1902 . It was Ž . later confirmed by Milligan 1969 and was also Ž . found by Johnson et al. 1997 . A recently published satellite image supports the model findings by showing warm river water north or even west of the Ž Yamal peninsula NATO, 1998; Krosshavn et al., . 1998 .\n\nFollowing this pronounced spring intrusion, the large extent of the river plume in the central Kara Sea diminishes in AugustrSeptember, when the winds change and large amounts of freshwater are pushed back to the Siberian shore. A coastal current develops that prevails throughout autumn and winter. This leads to seasonally varying export rates of river water. Whereas in winter the export is enhanced and mostly through Vilkitzky Strait into the Laptev Sea, the summer export of river water is much lower and mainly northward, towards the Arctic Eurasian basin.\n\nThe particle tracking studies revealed, that at lower levels, the Ob and Yenisei tracers behave very differently. Yenisei tracers usually leave the model domain quite fast to the east but Ob tracers spread to a large extent also in the south-western Kara Sea. A reason for the abundance of Ob tracers in the southern Kara Sea is probably the current variability at the Yamal coast. North-eastward currents at the west coast of Yamal prevail only during autumn and winter, but in spring and summer, the flow is mainly Ž . south-westward Harms and Karcher, 1999 . Ob tracers that have reached the north coast of Yamal may be caught by these flows and transported into the southern Kara Sea.\n\nYenisei tracers at lower levels are much slower than the corresponding surface tracers which leave the model region in less than 1 year. The reason for longer transit times at lower levels is a south-westward undercurrent that flows at 5-10 cmrs along the Siberian shore, in the opposite direction to the Ž . surface flow Harms and Karcher, 1999 . In our model simulations, the main driving force for this flow is a strong baroclinic pressure gradient, stemming from the sloping isopycnals in the vertical Ž . density stratification c.f. Fig. 5 . The baroclinic pressure gradient opposes the barotropic one, which is determined by the sea surface elevation. This situation is most likely in late summer, when the river plume has fully established and the wind and the coastal sea level still reflect the summer situation. The Siberian undercurrent is therefore strongest in late summer and weakest or absent in late winter or spring. Recent observations and modelling efforts support our findings: vertical current shear was also found at current meter moorings deployed close to\n\nCalculations on the large scale are performed with an Arctic version of a coupled ice-ocean model OPYC, based on a development by Oberhuber ( ) I.H. Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 106 Ž 1990Trenberth et al., 1989;;Aukrust and Oberhu-. ber, 1995 . Monthly means of cloud cover and hu-Ž . midity are taken from Wright, 1988 . After 35 years, when a stable seasonal cycle in the ice and the upper ocean circulation is achieved, the integration is stopped. This seasonal cycle of the model flow is used to drive a tracer transport model, which is based on an Eulerian advectiverdiffusive scheme equivalent to the one used for temperature and salinity in the ocean model. In addition, the seasonal cycle of ice drift and circulation is used to calculate Lagrangian ice trajectories.\n\nThe ocean model does not have an explicit inflow of river water. Instead, the inflow of freshwater on the shelves is realised via a restoring of the sea surface salinity to the observed salinity data from Ž . Gorshkov 1980 . A passive tracer is injected in proportion to the observed monthly mean river runoff Ž . data Gorshkov, 1980 at the river mouths of Lena, Ob and Yenisei. Three minor rivers discharging into the same estuaries are added to the three major rivers. The yearly runoff rate amounts to 560 km 3 ryear for Lena and Oljenok, 563 km 3 ryear for Ob and Pur and 689 km 3 ryear for Yenisei and Pjasina. Since the river water tracers are passive, they can as well be viewed as plumes of contaminants.\n\nThe river water from Ob and Yenisei stays on the Kara Sea shelf for the first two years after release Ž . Figs. 8 and 9 . The bulk of this water subsequently enters the Laptev Sea via the Vilkitsky Strait in the third year, while a smaller fraction moves northward.\n\nŽ . This agrees with results from Frank 1996 who ( ) I.H. Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 107 derived river water fractions from d 18 O measurements. The advection of a large fraction of Kara Sea river water into the Laptev Sea before passing further into the central Arctic Ocean is also indicated by measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon Ž . Olsson and Anderson, 1997 . Leaving the Laptev Sea, the waters of Ob and Yenisei split. One part turns northward along the Lomonossov Ridge to reach the North Pole with the Transpolar Drift after about 7 years, another part continues eastward. It enters the East Siberian Sea, where a maximum extent of the river water from the Kara Sea is achieved after 14 years. The Transpolar branch arrives at Fram Strait 11 years after starting at the river mouths and after 15 years Ob and Yenisei waters start entering Nares Strait in the Canadian Archipelago. About 20 years after start, both river tracer distributions are in a seasonal cyclic state. Whereas the path and the advective time scale of both tracers are very similar, the concentrations of the Yenisei water are about 3-4% and of Ob water 2-3% in the western Eurasian Basin.\n\nThe movement of tracers originating from the Lena river contrasts the Ob and Yenisei tracers, Ž which exhibit very similar on the large scale Fig.\n\n. 10 . The seasonal variability of all three river water distributions is rather small on the Arctic scale. However, the Lena river plume has its maximum extension in spring, when river water fractions as high as 30% reach the Severnaya Semlya islands. After 2 years, the Lena river water leaves the Laptev Sea shelf. Part of the water proceeds with the shelf current eastward, as far as the New Siberian Islands.\n\nHere, the Lena river water makes up about 10% of the surface water, all year round. The other part feeds directly into the Transpolar Drift reaching the North Pole after 9 years, the Canadian Archipelago and Fram Strait after 15 years. ( ) I.H. Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 108 Ž . Schlosser et al. 1994 estimated a mean residence time for river water on the shelves of 3.5 \" 1.5 years from TritiumrHelium measurements. Three and a half years have also been estimated by Pavlov and Ž . Pfirman 1995 . The mean residence time of river water in the polar surface layer of the Eurasian Basin Ž . is computed to 4.1-6.5 years by Frank 1996 . Taking into consideration that those estimates make use of data from the whole Eurasian Basin including the shelves, the model results and the estimates from the data are in good agreement.\n\nIt is remarkable that in the current model simulation the concentrations of Lena river tracers leaving the Arctic Ocean via the Canadian Archipelago are almost twice as high as in the East Greenland Current, Fram Strait. Contrary to that, the Ob and Yenisei concentrations are more evenly distributed in both throughflow areas. As discussed in Karcher and Ž . Oberhuber 1999 , the current model run exhibits a small Beaufort Gyre and a Transpolar Drift consisting of several branches, all of which show positions above or beyond the Lomonossov Ridge. The modelled river water, e.g. from the Kara Sea, moves with water originating from the Atlantic. Such a dominance of the Atlantic inflow, extending as far eastward as the Mendeleev Ridge, appears to be typical for the early 1990s. This situation which can be Ž inferred from hydrographic and tracer data see, e.g.\n\n. Carmack et al., 1997 andMcLaughlin et al., 1997\n\nIn the past few years, the transport of contaminants within Arctic sea-ice became of growing con-Ž cern e.g. Pfirman et al., 1995;Meese et al., 1997; . Ž Cooper et al., 1998 . In different studies e.g. Dethleff et al., 1993;Nurnberg et al., 1994;Pfirman et ¨. al., 1997a,b;Landa et al., 1998 the Laptev and Kara Seas were identified as sources of potentially contaminated sea ice sediments. Entrainment of sediments into newly forming sea ice occurs during fall Ž . freeze up Eicken et al., 1997 and in winter flaw Ž . leads Dethleff et al., 1994;Dethleff et al., 1998a , which produce high amounts of new ice through the Ž mechanism of offshore advection e.g. Martin and . Cavalieri, 1989;Dethleff et al., 1998b .\n\n. Sherwood in press modeled the entrainment of sediments into newly forming lead ice in the southern Kara Sea off the mouths of Ob and Yenisej Rivers. He concluded that bottom material and riverine particles may be incorporated. Observations confirm that significantly, sediment-laden drift ice oc-Ž . curs in that area pers. com. C. Haas, 1998 . The sediment was considerably enriched in the upper 60-100 cm of the 1.5-2.0-m thickness level and ridged ice. This points to turbulent entrainment of suspended particulate material during the initial state of ice formation in coastal flaw leads or polynyas Žcompare Reimnitz et al., 1993;Dethleff et al., . 1998a . Turbid fast ice -with highest material concentration in the upper 30-50 cm of the 2-m-thick ice canopy -was observed directly in the Ob Estuary. The material was probably entrained under stormy conditions during fall freeze-up and was then trapped in the coastal fast ice.\n\nThe sediment load annually discharged by the Ob and Yenisei into the Kara Sea is 16.5 and 5.9 million Ž . tons, respectively Gordeev et al., 1996 . Detailed export estimates of potentially radioactively polluted, ice-rafted river and shelf bottom sediments from the Ob and Yenisei region toward the central Arctic basin are not available due to a lack of data on local ice formation rates and sea-ice sediment concentra-Ž . tions. For comparison, Eicken et al. 1997  Ž between 10 and 157 mgrl e.g. Dethleff et al., 1994, 50 mgrl;Dethleff et al., 1998a, 10 mgrl;Eicken et al., 1997, 156 mgrl;Lindemann, 1998, 34  lease may enhance the entrainment of cesium into the local food web.\n\nTo investigate the process of particle drift with sea ice, we tried to detect at which time and in which areas the incorporation of simulated river particles into newly forming sea ice is most likely. We found that this is in November and December along the Ž . newly formed sea ice Fig. 11, lower panels . These simulations showed that, from all chosen start points, the ice trajectories are able to leave the Kara Sea Ž . within one winter. Landa et al. 1998 showed by backward trajectories that radioactively polluted sea ice sediments sampled in the Siberian Branch of the Transpolar Drift System were entrained close to the shallow sites that we chose as starting points of our Ž . forward trajectories Fig. 12 . This implies that the ice formed in the area of our investigation is supposed to leave the Kara Sea and either join the Transpolar Drift or enter the Barents Sea.\n\nIn the following, we study the large scale drift of riverine sediments incorporated into Siberian flaw lead ice. We make use of the seasonal cycle of the ice drift and ice thickness calculated by the large scale model described in Section 3.1. Ice drift trajectories are calculated for three subsequent years after being started during periods of ice formation. If the ice which carries the trajectory melts, the trajectory is stopped. An ice parcel is defined to have melted when the ice thickness sinks below 5 cm between May and September.\n\nFig. 13 shows the trajectories emanating from areas where the regional scale study has shown a high probability of the occurrence of riverine sediments at the time of freeze up. Due to the partly Ž westward drift of particles from the Ob river see . above , we started ice drift trajectories from grid Ž . points all around the Yamal peninsula Fig. 13a . The month of start for the Ob and the western Ž . Yenisei trajectories Fig. 13b was set to be October. Fig. 13c shows trajectories starting in the far eastern part of the Kara Sea, close to Vilkitsky Strait, where the regional scale study also has shown some probability for particles from the Yenisei to appear. Since here the freeze up commences at an earlier time, they Ž . start in September Harms and Karcher, 1999 . All three ensembles show a strong tendency to leave the Kara Sea westward into the Barents Sea. Obviously the ice parcels from the Ob area have a tendency to melt in the western Barents Sea at the summer ice edge. The Yenisei trajectories reach further and melt in the vicinity of Svalbard. Some of the eastern trajectories leave the shelf area north of Franz Josef Land before they also end up in the Barents Sea. The most eastern ones pass Vilkitsky Strait and join the Transpolar Drift.  from the Lena river are assumed to be incorporated. The western trajectories are started in October, the eastern ones in January. All trajectories which manage to leave the Laptev Sea head forward on the Siberian flank of the Transpolar Drift to Fram Strait. This implies that the western flank of the ice drift in the East Greenland Current is likely to consist of ice from the East Siberian Sea or the Beaufort Gyre.\n\nDue to the seasonally varying circulation in the Kara Sea, the dispersion of river water tracers depends very much on the time of release. During spring, the effluents from Ob and Yenisei propagate to a large extent into the central Kara Sea, instead of going eastward as one would expect. Main driving forces for this considerable intrusion of river water are peak discharge rates of more than 100,000 m 3 rs Ž . e.g. Yenisei and the wind. Since the spring break-up of Arctic rivers ice is a very turbulent event, large amounts of suspended load, sediments and hence Ž contaminants might enter the Kara Sea Pfirman et . al., 1995;Krosshavn et al., 1998 . Our model results confirm that together with the spring river runoff, contaminated dissolved or particulate material might Ž . spread in deep areas ) 150-m depth of the Kara Sea, more than 250 km off the coast. However, in the remaining time of the year, mainly in autumn and winter, high amounts of river water are found mostly in very shallow areas along the Siberian shore, where a baroclinic coastal current prevails. The export of river water and, e.g. contaminants from the Kara Sea is strongest in winter, mainly through Vilkitzky Strait to the Laptev Sea. The summer export is weaker and also west of Severnaya Semlya towards the Eurasian Arctic basin. It has to be stated of course that many contaminants are not passive but, e.g. interact with the marine environment they encounter. The full range of such biogeochemical effects is far beyond the purpose of this study.\n\nThe transit times of river contaminants from Ob and Yenisei depend very much on the depth horizon. Whereas surface river tracers usually need less than 1 year to leave the Kara Sea, near bottom tracers might circulate for several years in the central parts. This holds in particular for the Ob river tracers that ( ) I.H. Harms et al.r Journal of Marine Systems 27 2000 95-115 spread to a large extent in the south-western Kara Sea.\n\nOn the Arctic scale, Kara Sea river water clearly dominates in Siberian branch of the Transpolar Drift, while the Lena water dominates the Canadian branch. Due to the far western position of the Transpolar Drift, the river water fractions in Nares Strait of the Canadian Archipelago are similar to those in the northern Fram Strait. This even holds for the Kara Sea river water. As a consequence, dissolved contaminants would be able to reach the Archipelago on a time scale of 15 years after release at the Siberian estuaries. However, a change in the circulation pattern of the Arctic surface water from a far western to a more eastern position of the Transpolar Drift might interrupt a continuous feed of Siberian water into the Archipelago. Such a change is assumed to happen on Ž time scales of 5-10 years Proshutinsky and John-. son, 1997 . This concept has to be taken into account when evaluating the oceanic state which is realised in the present model runs on the basis of a climatological forcing field.\n\nWe found strong evidence for the transport of contaminated river sediments or particles by Arctic sea ice. In the Kara Sea, the abundance of river particles in Siberian coastal waters coincides in autumn with high thermodynamic ice production rates. Very similar situations were reported from the Laptev Sea. The incorporation of river particles from Ob, Yenisei and Lena into freezing sea ice is therefore very likely. The Arctic sea ice movement allows the incorporated particles to drift more or less undiluted towards Fram Strait, the Nordic Seas or the Barents Sea. Through ice melt, these possibly contaminated particles are introduced to the marine environment and food chain. On the regional scale, simulated ice velocities and surface currents reveal considerable differences in direction and speed, mainly during autumn and winter along the Siberian coast. Contrary to densitydriven surface currents which tend to go eastward, the more wind-driven ice movement is mainly directed north-or north-westward into the central Arctic. The ice trajectories emerging from the Ob and Yenisei estuaries easily leave the Kara Sea within one winter which allows the incorporated particles to drift more or less undiluted either to the Barents Sea or towards Fram Strait. The large-scale results sug-gest that there is a high probability for ice-containing particles from Yenisei to melt in the vicinity of Svalbard. Here may be a reason for the enhanced concentrations of certain contaminants like PAHs Ž . Ž Klungsoyr andStange, 1997 andPCBs de March . et al., 1998 in the surface sediment south and southeast of Svalbard.\n\nEven if in this study no trajectory from the Kara Sea estuaries reaches Fram Strait, it has to be assumed that it is principally possible. Since we were using climatological atmospheric forcing for the numerical models, the natural variability of ice and ocean flows is underestimated. A longer period of southerly winds over the Kara Sea for example, would carry the ice a little further northward so as to reach that part of the Transpolar Drift which continues to Fram Strait. The trajectories starting from the coastal areas near the Lena river mouth show a strait forward transport with the Transpolar Drift. The finding that they make up the eastern, 'Siberian' flank of the Drift corroborate the results of backward Ž . trajectories from Pfirman et al. 1997a .\n\nOutlooking, we can state that more field work has to be conducted in order to investigate and quantify Ž .\n\ni the riverine input of particulate matter and at-Ž . tached pollutants to the Siberian shelf seas, ii the rates of freeze-up and flaw lead ice formation partic-Ž . ularly off the river mouths, and iii the entrainment of sediments and attached pollutant into newly forming sea ice. This holds of course also for future modelling efforts. In particular, the transport of suspended particles and sediment and the forcing of the circulation models with high-frequent, realistic meteorological data need more attention."
