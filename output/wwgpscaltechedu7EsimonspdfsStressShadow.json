    "abstract": "We use idealized frictional models of fault creep to examine interseismic creep on subduction megathrusts. We consider hot friction (i.e., rate-dependent friction) and rate-state friction. When there is significant postseismic creep surrounding locations of coseismic slip, the creep rates surrounding an asperity may be lower than plate rate late in the seismic cycle. This lowering of the creep rates is due to stress shadows around the interseismically locked asperity. Stress shadows depend on the geometries of all of the nearby asperities and the megathrust rheology. Larger asperities produce larger interseismic stress shadows, and multiple asperities can act together to produce a stress shadow larger than the sum of the effects of the individual asperities. Roughly, the size of the stress shadows increases as there is more transient postseismic creep. For rate-state frictional megathrusts, there is a wide range of transient postseismic creep that occurs: from pulses of postseismic creep that decay over the postseismic period, to delayed postseismic creep. In delayed postseismic creep, the immediate postseismic creep rates following coseismic slip are low, but then increase during the later postseismic period, only to eventually decrease back below the plate convergence rate later in the seismic cycle.",
    "full_text": "In 1983, J. Savage proposed the kinematic back-slip model of interseismic deformation in subduction zones (Savage, 1983). This back-slip model was motivated by an equivalent model of interseismic deformation near continental strike slip faults (Savage & Burford, 1973), and describes interseismic deformation through imposed fault slip in an elastic half-space. The name of the model derives from its assumption that interseismic deformation is given by the superposition of block-like deformation across a subduction interface, or megathrust, and deformation resulting from regions of the megathrust slipping opposite to the sense of the megathrust loading (i.e., back-slip). Since block-like motion does not contribute to the surface strain, only the back-slip needs to be modeled, where regions of the megathrust that are locked during the interseismic period back-slip at the plate convergence rate, and regions that are creeping do not back-slip (Savage 1983).\n\nThe back-slip model is most commonly used in studies of strain accumulation on megathrusts (e.g., Nishimura et al. 2004;Norabuena et al. 2004), and the regions of high back-slip rates corresponds to asperities (e.g., Bürgmann et al. 2005;Suwa et al. 2006;Hashimoto et al. 2009). Asperities are generally defined to be regions of coseismic slip (e.g., Aki 1984;Kanamori 1986;Bilek & Lay 2002), although in this paper we use \"asperities\" to refer to regions that only experience coseismic slip, with negligible interseismic creep. The back-slip model is entirely kinematic, and thus there is no explicit connection between back-slip and the mechanical properties of the megathrust, although backslipping regions are often referred to as coupled. Wang & Dixon (2004) and Wang (2007) argue that an over-reliance on coupling concepts in the back-slip model can lead to several physical inconsistencies, mostly arising due to the lack of a megathrust rheology in this kinematic model. Savage (1995) demonstrated that the back-slip model can account for postseismic fault creep, and most researchers acknowledge that the back-slip model merely captures the instantaneous creep rate of the megathrust (e.g., Mazzotti et al. 2000;Nishimura et al. 2004). Finally, Kanda & Simons (2009) showed that failing to account for the full deformation field of the slab as it bends through the subduction system can lead to potential biases in the back-slip models.\n\nIn almost all subduction zones where the back-slip model has been applied, regions of large inferred coupling are much broader and smoother than the known locations of past earthquakes (e.g., Nishimura et al. 2004;Suwa et al. 2006;Chlieh et al. 2008). The smoothness of back-slip is partly due to an imposed regularization in the back-slip model. Bürgmann et al. (2005) used the locations of known asperities to decrease the artificial smoothness of the back-slip model, and suggested that coseismic slip may occur on fully locked asperities surrounded by partially coupled regions (i.e., regions\n\nF o r P e e r R e v i e w\n\nInterseismic Fault Creep II 3 that experience both significant coseismic slip and interseismic creep). There also may be mechanical reasons for smooth variations in the degree of apparent coupling resolved in a back-slip model. For instance, it has been suggested that partially coupled regions (i.e., regions with non-zero back-slip less than the plate rate) may indicate numerous small asperities (Igarashi et al. 2003), or regions experiencing long-lived transient slow slip (Meade & Loveless, 2009). Additionally, if the total postseismic creep following a megathrust earthquake is comparable to the coseismic slip, then large regions surrounding the asperities may creep slower than plate rate at the end of the interseismic period, appearing partially coupled within a back-slip formulation (Savage 1995).\n\nIn contrast to the steady interseismic creep observed during the later interseismic period, creep following large earthquakes tends to be highly transient. Observed transient postseismic creep on megathrusts exhibits a spectrum of behaviours from relatively simple decay of initially large postseismic creep rates (e.g., Heki et al. 1997;Miyazaki et al. 2004;Hsu et al. 2006), to a complicated interaction between propagating postseismic creep and large aftershocks (e.g., Yagi et al. 2003;Miura et al. 2006;Pritchard & Simons 2006). We do not investigate the complex interaction between postseismic creep and aftershocks; however, we show that in models with frictional faults, postseismic creep does not always decay simply over the postseismic period. For example, for some rate-state, velocity strengthening friction faults, postseismic creep rates following coseismic slip may be initially low, and then increase during the later postseismic period, before decreasing back below the plate convergence rate. This delayed postseismic creep is similar, although much more subtle, to the unstable transient slip explored by Perfettini & Ampuero (2008).\n\nWe use the model of localized fault creep we developed in a companion paper (Hetland, Simons, & Dunham Interseismic and Postseismic Fault Creep I: Model Description; hereafter referred to as Paper 1), to illustrate some of the interseismic creep behavior one might expect for a heterogeneous megathrust frictional rheology. Specifically, we first demonstrate that late in the seismic cycle, interseismic creep rates surrounding asperities can be much less than the plate convergence rate, due to the fact that interseismically locked asperities shadow stresses on the surrounding megathrust late in a seismic cycle. The pattern of these stress shadows depends on the megathrust rheology and the configuration of the asperities. Second, we explore a few ways in which spatial heterogeneity of the megathrust rheology affects transient creep rates throughout the interseismic period. We do not attempt to explore the infinite combination of asperity geometries and heterogeneous megathrust rheologies. Instead, we present a few simplified models in order to build intuition about the relationship between interseismic creep and megathrust rheology.\n\nF o r P e e r R e v i e w 4 E.A. Hetland and M. Simons\n\nWe consider an idealized megathrust geometry throughout this paper, composed of a reverse fault dipping 20 • from horizontal (Fig. 1a). We only calculate fault slip in the thrust direction, and all results we present are the thrust-component. We do not describe the model calculation here, and refer readers to Paper 1 for details of the model formulation. The computational domain is 20D along strike and 10D along dip, where D is a characteristic dimension of asperities (Fig. 1a). The fault is assumed to slide steadily at the plate convergence rate, v T , outside of the computational domain. The size of the computational domain is chosen in order to minimize the effect of the imposed far-field steady creep on interseismic creep near the asperities. When steady creep is imposed relatively close to the asperities, the creep rate late in the seismic cycle can be artificially high due to the proximity of the load (see Paper 1, Section 3.3). To limit the computation burden of these models, we use a uniform fault discritization from -4D to 4D along strike and 0-3.5D along dip, and a non-uniform discretization in the far-field (Fig. 1). We impose all coseismic slip, and we assume that asperities slip uniformly, with coseismic slip arbitrarily tapering to zero outside of the asperity (Fig. 2; see Paper 1, Section 3.2 for a discussion of coseismic slip in non-asperity regions). We spin-up the models from the initial fault traction required to slide the fault steadily at v T , and we apply coseismic slip periodically in time, We focus on velocity strengthening frictional fault zones, with either rate-dependent friction or rate-and state-dependent friction. We refer to the later as \"rate-state friction\", and following Linker & Rice (1997) we refer to the former as \"hot friction\". The fault constitutive equation for hot friction is\n\nwhere we take v T to be the frictional reference slip rate, and we define\n\nfor reference friction f o , frictional parameters a and b, and effective normal traction σ E (e.g., Marone et al. 1991; Paper 1). The fault constitutive equation for rate-state friction is\n\nwhere we again take v T to be the frictional reference slip rate,\n\nF o r P e e r R e v i e w parameters are as defined above (e.g., Dieterich 1979;Ruina 1983). We assume that frictional state varies according to the slip law, given by\n\n(e.g., Marone 1998). For velocity strengthening friction, (ab) > 0 or equivalently γ < 1. For reasonable values of frictional parameters and characteristic dimensions, ρ h and ρ are about 10-100, α h and α are of order 10 -1 , γ ≈ 1, and L is about 10 -7 -10 -3 . In practice, calculations with L this low are too computationally burdensome (see discussions in Rice 1993;Lapusta & Rice 2003; Paper 1), and we take L > 10 -2 for most of the models we consider.\n\nFor hot friction, except in Section 3, we assume homogeneous fault properties across the nonasperity regions of the megathrust, with ρ h = 10 and variable α h . For rate-state friction, except in Section 3, we assume spatially homogeneous ρ = 10 and γ = 0.9. We vary α in these models, and F o r P e e r R e v i e w 6 E.A. Hetland and M. Simons\n\nwe mainly consider α spatially uniform across the megathrust, although in Section 5 we consider a particular instance of heterogeneous α . We assume constant L = L o in the center of the megathrust where the fault discretization is constant, and we increase L in the far field at the same rate that the along-dip cell dimension increases (Fig. 1b). This increase in L arises because the local fault cell size limits the permissible rate-state friction parameters (Perfettini & Ampuero 2008); however, in all models we specify that L in the far-field is ten times L o , regardless of whether a smaller L in the far-field would be permissible. Interseismic creep in the far-field does not significantly deviate from steady creep during the entire calculation.\n\nThe example models presented in Paper 1, assumed infinite length, vertical strike-slip faults. In those models, normal traction across the faults did not vary during the interseismic period.\n\nBoth coseismic and interseismic slip, either strike-slip or dip-slip, on a finite portion of a dipping fault will lead to variations in normal traction. In general, any slip on an arbitrarily shaped fault leads to variations in normal traction across that fault. Coseismic slip leads to larger perturbations to fault normal traction compared to interseismic creep, because of the larger fault offsets. At noted in Paper 1, we can include time-dependent normal traction in the frictional fault constitutive equations by setting σ E (ζ , t ) = σ o (ζ ) + τ n (ζ , t ), where σ o (ζ ) is a non-dimensional reference normal traction, τ n (ζ , t ) is the timedependent normal traction. As long as σ o (ζ ) τ n (ζ , t ), the variation of normal traction can be ignored in the frictional constitutive equations. However, if τ n (ζ , t ) is of the order of, or greater than, σ o (ζ ), the variation of normal traction needs to be accounted for. When we include variations in normal traction in the fault constitutive equations, it is no longer convenient to parametrize rate-state friction by ρ, γ, and α (ρ h and α h for hot friction), and instead it is more natural to consider a, b, f o , and σ o (ab, f o , and σ o for hot friction).\n\nWe demonstrate the effect of including variations in normal traction using our megathrust model with a rate-state friction rheology and the coseismic slip distribution in Fig. 2a. We consider four ratestate friction models, two including τ n (ζ , t ) and two assuming σ E = σ o (for simplicity we assume a uniform σ o across the megathrust). We refer to the former models as \"variable normal traction\" (VNT) models, and the latter as the \"constant normal traction\" (CNT) models. In all four models, we set γ = 0.9 and L o = 0.06. In the two VNT models, we take a = 0. ity, and one down-dip of the asperity (Fig. 2a). Due to the weak dependence of the interseismic creep on changes in ρ in these models (see Section 4.2 of Paper 1), the interseismic creep rate at the two locations in CNT models 1 and 2 are virtually identical (Fig. 3). However, the interseismic creep rate in the two VNT models is distinct from that in the CNT models (Fig. 3). The effect on the creep rate of including variable normal traction is greatest up-dip of the asperity, where coseismic slip results in a larger decrease in normal traction (Fig. 3). Additionally, the change in interseismic creep rate is greater when f o = 0.6 compared to when f o = 0.2 (Fig. 3). In these models, the coseismic normal traction perturbation is at most about 0.5, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the reference normal traction of 20. For a characteristic asperity size of 10 km, coseismic slip of 1 m, and shear modulus of 10 GPa, σ o = 20 corresponds to σ o = 20 MPa. For lower σ o , the variations in normal traction will influence the interseismic creep to a larger degree. As σ o increases beyond 20, time-dependent normal traction due to fault slip has an increasingly negligible affect on interseismic creep rate.\n\nCreep rates in the CNT and VNT models are only different during the postseismic period (Fig.\n\n3\n\n). The increased rates in the normal variable models is partially offset by decreased rates later in the postseismic period, and thus there is little effect on the cumulative creep later in the interseismic period. For the rest of the calculations in this paper, we ignore any time-dependence in normal traction on the megathrust. We do this mainly to decrease the number of controlling parameters in the frictional constitutive equations, especially since many of them are not well constrained apriori. It should be understood, that the effect of ignoring time-dependent normal traction could change the predicted\n\nF o r P e e r R e v i e w\n\nAs also observed following megathrust earthquakes (e.g., Miyazaki et al. 2004;Hsu et al. 2006;Chlieh et al. 2007), for most frictional rheologies in our models, creep rates are high surrounding the asperity immediately following a megathrust earthquake, and then decrease in time. Depending on the amount of cumulative postseismic creep, creep rates late in the seismic cycle may be substantially lower than plate rate. These low creep rates can be simply understood just by appealing to the creep budget required to satisfy the long-term plate convergence rate, where heightened postseismic creep rates are offset by low creep rates late in the seismic cycle. In our model, the decrease of creep rates during the interseismic period are due to a decrease of traction surrounding the asperities as the coseismic stresses are relaxed, and in essence, asperities mechanically shadow the surrounding fault during the later interseismic period. The degree to which the asperities shadow stresses depends on both the megathrust rheology and the geometry of the asperities. We consider both hot and rate-state friction megathrusts. We first explore the effect of the megathrust rheologies, then the effect of the shape and distributions of the asperities, and finally the effect of the coseismic slip distribution. We do not attempt to explore the infinite range of model rheologies or geometries, instead we present a few models in order to illustrate the connection between postseismic transient creep and stress shadows.\n\nIn the case of a hot frictional megathrust, as α h decreases, postseismic creep is activated over a larger region of the megathrust surrounding the asperity (Fig. 4). When α h = 0.02, there is significant postseismic creep up-dip of the asperity, as well as over a broad region surrounding the asperity (Fig. 4a). These regions of heightened postseismic creep roughly correlate with low creep rates at the end of the interseismic period (Fig. 4d). As α h increases, postseismic creep is more localized near the asperity and there is less total postseismic creep (Fig. 4b and c). Hence, for larger α h , the stress shadow is smaller around the asperity later in the interseismic period (Fig. 4e and f). With a hot-friction fault, the late interseismic stress shadow roughly correlates with the regions over which transient postseismic creep is activated, and the interseismic creep rate late in a cycle reflects the deficit between all creep during the cycle and the earthquake slip needed to account for the plate convergence.\n\nIn the case of a rate-state frictional megathrust, decreasing α results in postseismic creep activated over larger regions of the megathrust surrounding the asperity, similar to models with hot frictional faults (Fig. 5a-c). Although, compared to hot friction models, the heightened postseismic creep rates in rate-state friction models last longer into the interseismic period, because postseismic creep propagates from the asperities as fairly long-lived creep pulses (Paper 1). These postseismic creep pulses increase the total postseismic creep in the regions farther from the asperity, regions that did not experience heightened postseismic creep rates immediately following the earthquake. As a result, unlike the hot friction models, the stress shadow in rate-state frictional faults that develops around the asperity is significantly larger than the regions experiencing immediate short term postseismic creep (Fig. 5d-f).\n\nChanges in L strongly affect the spatio-temporal pattern of postseismic creep (see Paper 1). In models we explored but do not present here, the stress shadows that developed late in the interseismic period were all similar for various L . We note, that due to computational limits, we were unable to explore models with L less than 0.01, and the largest L we considered was 0.30. For coseismic slip of 1 m, L = 0.01 corresponds to L = 1 cm, significantly larger than the experimentally derived L = 10 -6 -10 -4 m (e.g., Marone 1998). Marone & Kilgore (1993) suggested that L may be of order propagate from the asperity at a faster rate, and this there is more cumulative creep farther from the asperity and earlier in the postseismic period (Paper 1).\n\nDuring the second half of the interseismic period there is a slight increase of creep rates near the asperity, and thus an erosion of the stress shadow (the effect is strongest for low α ). The increase of the creep rates does not appear to be due to any effects from a limited computational domain (as described in Paper 1, Section 3.3), rather it appears that the increase of L in the far-field is the cause of this increase in creep rates. These far-field regions slide close to v T throughout the interseismic period, and act similar to the imposed steady creep if the computational domain was smaller. However, the effect on the creep rate is much less pronounced with a large fault domain and large far-field L compared to a limited fault domain size. In these models, after the coseismic stresses have decayed around the asperities, the stresses due to the far-field creep cause a slight increase in the creep rates near the asperities (less than about 5%).\n\nAs illustrated in Paper 1 and in Perfettini & Ampuero (2008), models with hot or rate-state friction predict similar creep rates later in the interseismic period as long as α h = α(1-γ) and ρ h = ρ/(1-γ).\n\nIn these models we compare frictional models for ρ h = ρ = 10 and α h = α. Our purpose here is not to investigate when creep in models with rate-state friction is similar to that in models with hot friction; rather we are concerned with comparing models which have either a similar amount of postseismic creep at a given time, or a similar stress shadow later in the interseismic period.\n\nIn Fig. 6, we show the cumulative creep at three times in the early postseismic period, and creep rates at three times in the late interseismic period. For simplicity, we only present the creep and creep rates along the center line (x = 0) of the models. The cumulative creep at any time during the interseismic period is different in models with either hot or rate-state friction and α h = α = 0.02, although the difference is not large (Fig. 6a). The interseismic creep rates in these two models are quite similar, and are fairly constant during the second half of the interseismic period (Fig. 6c). In models with either hot or rate-state friction and α h = α = 0.4, the cumulative creep is only similar at t = 0.05 (Fig. 6b).\n\nLater in the postseismic period, there is more cumulative creep in the model with rate-state friction, as the heightened postseismic creep rates propagate farther from the asperity. Likewise, the creep rates later in the interseismic period are significantly distinct in these two models (Fig. 6d). Low creep rates late in the interseismic period reflect both coseismic slip, as well as any transient creep at any time during the interseismic period, and with rate-state friction, there may be more transient creep farther and continuing later into the seismic cycle, compared to in the hot friction model.\n\nIn Fig. 7, we show the creep rates late in a seismic cycle for six different asperity geometries and a rate-state frictional fault. In all models, the coseismic slip is constant over the asperity, and tapers into the surrounding faults to a similar degree as the above circular asperities (Fig. 2a and b). Compared to the circular asperities, when the asperity either extends farther down-dip or is longer along strike, it is more effective at creating a stress shadow late in the interseismic period (7a and b). With these larger asperities, the stress shadow is more pronounced up-dip of the asperity as a result of greater postseismic creep near the free-surface, and thus larger asperities mechanically isolate the up-dip regions from the stable creep in the far-field. As the asperity thins in either direction, the asperity becomes less effective at creating a stress shadow compared to thicker asperities, and the width of the up-dip stress shadow roughly mirrors the along strike length (Fig. 7c and d). Finally, when the asperity is closer to the surface, it is more effective at creating a stress shadow up-dip of the asperity, and less effective when it is deeper (Fig. 7e and f).\n\nMultiple asperities can act together to shadow stresses over a larger region than the linear superposition of the stress shadows from the individual asperities. To illustrate stress shadows for multiple asperities, we consider two configurations of asperities: first two asperities of equal size, and second a large asperity surrounded by several small asperities.\n\nWe first consider a model with two circular asperities, with coseismic slip in Fig. 2a, separated by a variable distance. We impose coseismic slip on the two asperities periodically, each with maximum slip s o and repeat time T , such that each asperity slips T /2 after the adjacent asperity (i.e., the earthquakes on the two asperities are out of phase). We refer to the asperity at x < 0 (x > 0) as the left (right) asperity. In Fig. 8, we show the interseismic creep rates before the earthquake of the left asperity.\n\nWhen the asperities are close together, there is a large stress shadow surrounding the asperities, that is of comparable size to a stress shadow around a continuous asperity of the same dimensions (Figs. 7 and 8). Hence, late in a seismic cycle, the region between the two asperities would appear almost fully coupled in a back-slip model, and may be difficult to distinguish from a single asperity in practice.\n\nWhen the asperities are farther apart, the stress shadows around each asperity are more similar to those around isolated asperities, with the region between the asperities creeping closer to the plate rate late in the interseismic period (Fig. 8c).\n\nIn the two asperity models we show, the stress shadows are asymmetric late in the interseismic period, and are slightly stronger surrounding the asperity that is not about to slip (the right asperity; Fig. 8a). This seems counter-intuitive, since one would expect that the stress shadow would be larger around the asperity that is about to slip (the left asperity). The weaker stress shadow around the left asperity is partly due to the influence of the far-field increase in L , as described in Section 4.2; however, the erosion of the left stress-shadow is mostly due to an increase in creep rates caused by the propagation of a long-lived postseismic creep pulse from the right asperity. In these models, we assumed a rate-state frictional rheology with a fairly large L of 0.06. As a result, there is a fairly broad and long-lived postseismic creep pulse which propagates from the asperity following an earthquake.\n\nWhen the postseismic creep pulse encounters the adjacent asperity, it propagates at a slightly slower rate, and thus the relaxation of the postseismic traction continues late into the seismic cycle. Hence,\n\nWe next consider a model with one circular asperity surrounded by 30 smaller asperities (Fig. 9a). We impose that all of the small asperities slip together, either with slip s o and at the same time as the main asperity, or with slip s o /10 and periodically ten times as often as the main asperity. The first model, which we refer as the \"aftershock model\", is motivated by the elastodynamic model of Kato (2006), which includes small velocity weakening regions surrounding a large velocity weakening asperity. In his model, aftershocks on the small velocity weakening regions are caused by postseismic creep following the main earthquake. In the aftershock model, all asperities rupture at once, and so we assume that the length of the aftershock sequence is short compared to the interseismic period and that the cumulative coseismic slip in the aftershock sequence equals the coseismic slip of the main asperity. The second model is roughly analogous to a series of isolated asperities which rupture regularly during the interseismic period (the \"repeater model\"), and although highly idealized, is similar to the repeating earthquakes on the Japan trench investigated by Igarashi et al. (2003).\n\nIn the aftershock model, late in the interseismic period the stress shadow is comparable in size to a stress shadow resulting from a much larger asperity (Figs. 9b and 7b). The stress shadow at the end of the interseismic period in the repeater model, is also larger, although much rougher, than the stress shadow that would result if the main asperity were isolated (Figs. 9c and 5). Given the regularization imposed in conventional back-slip models, the roughness of the stress-shadow around the small asperities in the repeater model may not be detectable. Decreasing the number of small asperities will decrease the effectiveness of the interseismic stress-shadow, since the creep rates between the small asperities will be slightly larger at the end of the interseismic period. In general, multiple small asperities near a larger asperity will always result in a larger stress-shadow than the larger single asperity will produce.\n\nAs discussed in Paper 1, there there is a trade-off between the amount that coseismic slip extends transition regions relative to the asperities, results in a compact, spatially discontinuous coseismic slip distribution, and we refer to this as the \"compact model\" (Fig. 2b). On the other hand, increasing the size of the transition regions results in a smoother coseismic slip distribution (the \"smooth model\"; Fig. 2c).\n\nFor the same frictional parameters in the two models, the immediate postseismic creep rates are higher over a larger region in the compact model compared to in the smooth model. The difference in postseismic creep rates reflects the differing magnitudes of the traction perturbation due to these two coseismic slip distributions. As a result of the differing postseismic creep rates, the cumulative amount of creep during the postseismic period is different in the two models (Fig. 10). By increasing α in the compact model, one could tune the two models so that they produced the same postseismic creep at any particular time during the postseismic period (see Paper 1). Hence, if one is trying to infer fault zone rheological properties from instantaneous rates of deformation, there is a trade-off between the assumed coseismic slip imposed in the model and the rheology of the fault. However, for the same frictional parameters, the sum of the coseismic slip and the cumulative postseismic creep in the two models are similar (Fig. 10). Because the creep rates late in the interseismic reflect the deficit between the total slip over a seismic cycle, and the cumulative postseismic creep plus the coseismic slip, the creep rates later in the interseismic period are similar in the two models. Because of this weak relationship between the pattern of coseismic slip and the late interseismic creep rates, it would not be possible to infer the details of recent coseismic slip distributions from only observations of steady interseismic deformation; however, one would likely be able to infer plausible asperity geometries from interseismic deformation.\n\nIn all of the above models, the frictional parameters are heterogeneous across the entire megathrust, but are homogeneous in the vicinity of the asperities (Fig. 1b). The far-field heterogeneity modifies the interseismic creep slightly, for instance by limiting the extent of transient postseismic creep, or slightly increasing the creep rates near the asperities later in the interseismic period. Heterogeneous frictional parameters close to the asperities affect the interseismic creep to a much larger degree than far-field heterogeneity. In this section, we first explore some salient features of interseismic creep for various frictional parameters, and we then present a demonstration model with heterogeneous frictional parameters near the asperities. We consider models with a single asperity, and broadly tapered coseismic slip (Fig. 2c), and only present the cycle-invariant results for fully spun-up models.\n\nIn Fig. 11 we show the interseismic creep rates along the surface and down-dip of the asperity in models with varying α and L o , assuming homogeneous α and the heterogeneous L shown in Fig.  and h).\n\nTo highlight two of the behaviors of interseismic creep, we construct a demonstration megathrust model using the same coseismic slip as before (Fig. 2c), and including heterogeneous rate-state frictional parameters near the asperity. We increase α to five times the background value, α o , in a broad region down-dip of the asperity (Fig. 12a). Recalling that α = aσ E , we can interpret the increase of α to be the result of either an increase in the material parameter a or a larger effective normal traction across the megathrust; for simplicity we refer to the region of increased α as the \"clamped region\". We use the same far-field heterogeneous distribution of L as in the previous model (Fig. 1b), but in the near-field we increase L at the surface to five times the background value, L o (Fig. 12b).\n\nWe increase α down-dip of the asperity to generate delayed postseismic creep, and we increase L near the surface, while keeping α low, to avoid either delayed postseismic creep or the propagation of large postseismic creep pulses along the free surface. Assuming α o = 0.1 and L o = 0.04, up-dip of the asperity, the creep rates are large immediately following an earthquake (up to v = 40), and then decrease below plate-rate during the first several percent of the interseismic period (Fig. 13a-d). In contrast to up-dip, there is negligible immediate postseismic creep in the clamped region down-dip of the asperity (Fig. 13a-c). By about t = 0.04, the creep rates in the clamped region begin to increase, beginning an episode of delayed postseismic creep that lasts about 20% of the interseismic period, with maximum creep rates up to four times plate-rate (Fig. 13c-f). 2008). Hence, for a given coseismic traction perturbation, by either lowering L or increasing α we get delayed postseismic creep. Setting α o = 0.1, and decreasing L o from 0.1 to 0.01, the maximum postseismic creep rates in the clamped region increase (Fig. 13g). Additionally, with decreasing L the maximum creep rates occur earlier, and the duration of delayed postseismic creep episodes are shorter.  postseismic creep episode (Fig. 13g). Due to the fault cell size in these models, we can not explore lower values of L . In 2D models we have run with lower L , we find that the maximum creep rates in the delayed postseismic creep can be up to several orders of magnitude above plate-rate and occur much earlier in the interseismic period, similar to the unstable transient creep explored by Perfettini & Ampuero (2008).\n\nIn these models, varying frictional parameters affects the interseismic creep near the surface and at depth in similar ways, although certain effects are often exaggerated up-dip of the asperity due to the free surface at the trench. For instance, with low L a postseismic creep pulse may propagate along the trench with creep rates many times the plate convergence rate. Additionally, with increasing α there may be significant delayed postseismic creep near the trench, that lasts through a non-trivial amount of the postseismic period. Either of these phenomena would be fairly easy to detect geodetically, and to our knowledge, they are not typically observed near trenches following megathrust earthquakes. Instead, one commonly observes postseismic creep up-dip of megathrust earthquakes that decays through time (e.g., Miyazaki et al. 2004;Hsu et al. 2006;Chlieh et al. 2007). This may indicate that rate-state friction is not an appropriate rheology near the trench, or it may indicate that L is large and α is small in rate-state friction near the trench. Indeed large L may be plausible near the trench due to the the increase in unconsolidated material, where L is inversely proportional to the degree of shear localization in faults (e.g., Marone & Scholz 1988;Marone & Saffer 2007), and low α might reflect the low effective normal traction at these shallow depths.\n\nIn most of the models we present, we ignored the variation of fault normal traction throughout the seismic cycle. We justified this by showing that including the variation of normal traction on a planar dipping fault mainly affects the magnitudes of the creep rates, and not the cumulative creep.  In mechanical models with frictional faults, creep rates late in a seismic cycle reflect the deficit between the total slip expected over a seismic cycle, and the sum of coseismic slip and cumulative transient postseismic creep (Savage 1983;1995). In other words, late in a seismic cycle the creep rates surrounding an asperity may be lower than plate rate, if there was significant postseismic creep in these regions. While this creep budget argument is similar to that made by Savage (1995), in our model the lowering of the creep rates around the asperities is due to the shadowing of stresses by the interseismically locked asperity. Hence, late in a seismic cycle, coupling inferred in a back-slip model may not necessarily reflect just the configuration of asperities, but also the stress shadows surrounding those asperities. The details of the stress shadows depend on the megathrust rheology, the geometries of all of the nearby asperities, and their histories of coseismic slip. For hot friction faults, the size of the stress shadows increases as there is more transient postseismic creep. For rate-state friction fault, there may be significant long-lived postseismic creep at rates comparable to the plate convergence rate, and thus the amount of early postseismic creep may not indicate the size of the later interseismic stress shadows.\n\nWe show that there is a wide range of transient postseismic creep that may occur. In the standard conception of postseismic creep, the creep rates following coseismic slip are initially high, and then decay during the postseismic period. However, for some rate-state frictional rheologies, long-lived postseismic creep pulses may propagate from the asperities or the postseismic creep may be delayed, similar to the unstable transient creep documented by Perfettini and Ampuero (2008). The maximum creep rates in the creep pulses decrease through the postseismic period, but the postseismic creep pulses can continue to propagate during the later interseismic period, at rates comparable, or lower, than plate rate. In delayed postseismic creep, the immediate postseismic creep rates following coseismic slip are low, but then increase during the later postseismic period, only to eventually decrease back below the plate convergence rate later in the seismic cycle. It is plausible that delayed postseismic creep can initiate several years to decades after a megathrust earthquake, and last a substantial portion of the seismic cycle, and thus may not be readily recognized as transient postseismic creep.\n\nThe dependence of interseismic creep on megathrust rheologies and asperity geometries can be complicated, but due to the relatively low computational cost of our model, many configurations of asperities, coseismic slip histories, and fault rheologies can be tested.
