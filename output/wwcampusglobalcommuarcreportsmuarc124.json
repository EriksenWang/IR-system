Thanks also to the Victorian Coroner's Office and the Department of Human Services for provision of databases (the Victorian Coroner's Facilitation System and the Victorian Inpatient Minimum Dataset) held at Monash University Accident Research Centre; the hospitals which collect data for the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset; the collecting general practitioners, the Central West Gippsland Division of General Practice and the Monash University Centre for Rural Health for their participation in the Extended Latrobe Valley Injury Surveillance project and the Victorian Spinal Cord Services at the Austin Hospital for data relating to spinal cord injury in Victoria.\n\nThanks also to the staff at MUARC, in particular Voula Stathakis, Mark Sinclair Stokes and Stephen Begg for the extraction of injury data from the various databases held at the Centre. Special thanks also to Anita Imberger for her assistance in producing the numerous tables and figures contained in this report and to Marg Young for formatting and preparing the report for publication.\n\nThis study broadly describes the epidemiology of injury in the State of Victoria at various levels of severity and provides an estimate of the total lifetime cost of injury to the Victorian community for cases which occurred in the financial year 1993/94, the most recent year for which reliable incidence data for each level of injury severity were available.\n\nFundamental to developing estimates of the economic cost of injury are data on incidence.\n\nEstimates of the numbers and rates of injury are presented in this report for three mutually exclusive groups that broadly reflect the severity of injury : (1) injury resulting in death, (2) injury resulting in hospitalisation with survival to discharge, and (3) injury requiring medical attention without hospitalisation. Incidence was also established for the different causes of injury, age and gender groups, location of the injury event and activity being undertaken at the time of injury.\n\nBecause important segments such as sporting, home and workplace injuries are concealed by the ICD-9 classification by cause, incidence estimates for each level of injury severity were also developed for the settings in which injury events occur and the activity being undertaken at the time of injury.\n\nThe major data sources used in estimating the number of injuries that occurred in Victoria in 1993/94 were the Victorian Coroners Facilitation System (VCFS) for deaths, the Victorian Inpatient Minimum Dataset (VIMD) for live hospital discharges and the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) and the Extended Latrobe Valley Injury Surveillance (ELVIS) for less severe, non-hospitalised injuries. Injuries for which medical attention was not sought at either a hospital Emergency Department or a general practice have not been included since there is no data currently available on the frequency of such cases. This will result in an underestimation of both the incidence of injury and the costs.\n\nThe total lifetime cost of injury estimated in this study consists of costs relating to the treatment of injury (direct costs) and costs relating to the loss, or partial loss, to society of the productive efforts (both paid and unpaid) of injury victims and care-givers in the case of children (indirect costs).\n\nDirect or treatment costs are the actual expenditure related to the injury and include medical and non-medical costs such as hospital (inpatient and Emergency Department), medical (general & specialist services) and rehabilitation (rehabilitation services, aids and equipment) costs associated with the treatment of injury. Other direct costs include ambulance transport, pharmaceuticals and treatment by health professionals other than medical doctors.\n\nAverage treatment costs for each level of injury severity were provided by the State's injury compensation schemes, the Transport Accident Commission and the Victorian WorkCover Authority. A matrix, based on nature of injury by body part, was also developed, in conjunction with the Victorian WorkCover Authority, to allow more specific allocation of direct costs to the various injury cause and age categories for hospitalised cases (hospitalised cases accounting for the major part of treatment costs).\n\nIndirect costs represent the value of lost output due to reduced productivity caused by injury and any resultant disability (morbidity) and losses due to premature death (mortality). Loss or partial loss of future production has been estimated in terms of earnings and labour on-costs of injury victims, the productive but unpaid contribution of victims to their households and communities and the productive time lost by care-givers of child injury victims.\n\nxiv MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE Indirect costs were estimated using the ex-post human capital method by assigning an economic value to the loss of life and productive capacity resulting from injury, following the work of Rice et al. (1989) and the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics (BTCE, 1992). In contrast to the BTCE (1992), which used the accident as the basic costing unit, in this study the basic costing unit is the injured person.\n\nSince the willingness-to-pay approach to valuing indirect cost is becoming more common, estimates of this cost in relation to injury in Victoria (based on overseas estimates of the value of life and non-fatal injuries), were also developed for reference purposes.\n\nIn 1993/94, injuries resulted in at least 1,487 deaths (with an estimated 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injuries sustained in that year), 67,402 persons hospitalised, and an estimated 397,160 medically-treated non-hospitalised injured persons in Victoria. In total, over 466,000 people were injured or 10.5 persons injured per year for every 100 Victorian residents. Just over one in 10 persons in this State, in a year, sustain an injury that requires at least an attendance at a hospital Emergency Department or a general practitioner's surgery. Many of these injuries are fatal or serious enough to require hospitalisation and are associated with long-term disability.\n\nOf the total 466,049 persons injured, almost 30 percent (134,543) were in the 25-44 year agegroup (who account for 31 percent of the Victorian population). Persons aged 15-24 comprise almost 16 percent of the Victorian population yet account for more than 20 percent (103,704) of all injuries. While children under the age of 15 account for 21 percent of the total Victorian population, they comprise almost 30 percent of the total injured population (about 131,500 injuries). Overall, persons aged under 45 years sustain almost 80 percent of all injuries.\n\nThe risk of injury is higher among males who sustain almost 62 percent of all injuries yet account for only 49.5 percent of the population. Almost 13 percent of Victorian males incur injuries, whereas for females the risk is lower with about 8 percent sustaining an injury in a year. Among both males and females the largest number of injuries occurs in the 25-44 year age-group. The risk of injury is highest, however, for younger males with more than one in five (or 20 percent of) males aged 15-24 sustaining an injury during a single year. Overall, the leading cause of injury death in Victoria is suicide, followed by motor vehicle accidents, whereas falls are the leading cause of hospitalisation and of all non-fatal injury.\n\nMost injuries occur in the home (36 percent) followed by areas of sport and recreation (12.5 percent) then transport (11.7 percent). In terms of activity being undertaken at the time of injury, most injuries were associated with sport and leisure activities (40.2 percent) followed by workrelated injury (11 percent) then transportation injuries (10.8 percent).\n\nNon-hospitalised 67,402 Hospitalised 1,629 deaths* Incidence 1993/94 466,191* injuries *includes 142 later year deaths x Deaths $506,627 Hospitalised $20,609 $929 Non-hospitalised Cost per Injured Person = Deaths $825 million $1,389 million Hospitalised $369 million Non-hospitalised Total Lifetime Cost $2,583 million xvi MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE\n\nThe total lifetime cost of injury for persons who sought medical treatment for injury in Victoria in 1993/94, is estimated at $2,582.9 million, or an average of $5,541 per injured person. Direct expenditure for treatment of injury including hospital, medical, pharmaceuticals, rehabilitation, attendant and nursing home care and other services amount to almost $759 million or $1,628 per injured person. (Note that average costs are skewed towards the cost of non-hospitalised injury due to the large number of cases in this category).\n\nDisability from injury results in loss of output with individuals generally, unable to attend to their normal activities (eg domestic duties), and members of the labour force, unable to work. In total more than 59,000 life-years (to age 75) are lost (46.5 days per injured person) as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94, valued at $1,010.5 million. The morbidity cost amounts to an average of $2,175 per injured person.\n\nOther losses result from premature injury fatalities. At least 1,487 premature deaths from injury occurred in 1993/94, with an estimated additional 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injury sustained in 1993/94. Premature death from injury amounted to an estimated annual loss of 48,773 life years (to age 75), or 30 years per death. The mortality cost amounted to $813.5 million, or an average cost of $499,378 per death.\n\nIn terms of cause, the greatest losses are due to motor vehicles traffic accidents and falls, accounting for $570.5 million and $557.2 million respectively. Although the injury rate for falls is higher than for motor vehicle accidents, the significantly higher number of motor vehicle fatalities among young people results in higher lifetime costs. Motor vehicle traffic injuries account for 7 percent of all injuries and 22 percent of total economic costs whereas falls account for almost 28 percent of injuries and 21.5 percent of total lifetime costs. Self-inflicted injury ranks third in economic cost, amounting to $428.4 million, or 16.5 percent of the total cost. Although self-inflicted injury accounts for only 1.8 percent of all injuries, fatalities at young ages are high (the suicide rate is highest in the 15-24 year-old age-group), resulting in high costs.\n\nIt is clear from the results of this study that injuries have a significant impact on the Victorian community, health care system and economy in general. The impact of disability due to injury on the individual and his/her family can be personally and economically devastating. All sectors of the Victorian economy share this burden, including federal, state and local governments, the private sector and individuals. In addition to the reduction in injured person-based costs identified in this study, effective injury prevention measures would also provide savings in non-person based costs of injury events such as property damage, fire, police and judicial services, etc.\n\nWhile other factors, particularly preventability, must also be taken into consideration in determining priorities for injury prevention, this study identifies the following groups as overrepresented in epidemiological or cost terms :\n\n• Suicide is the leading cause of injury death in Victoria followed by motor vehicle traffic accidents. As such these two causes also account for the highest mortality costs.\n\n• Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injury in Victoria. They also account for the highest total direct treatment costs and highest overall morbidity costs.\n\n• Males are over-represented in epidemiological terms. While they represent 49.5 percent of the population, they sustain 62 percent of all injuries. Almost three-quarters of injury fatalities and over 60 percent of non-fatal injuries occur among males.\n\n• Young people aged 15-24 years are over-represented in both epidemiological and cost terms. This age-group accounts for 22 percent of all injuries and almost 28 percent of the total lifetime cost, yet represents around 16 percent of the Victorian population. Persons in this agegroup also have the highest per person mortality costs averaging $813,286 per death.\n\n• Adults aged 25-44 are over-represented in terms of cost. Although this age-group represents 31 percent of the total Victorian population and accounts for a similar percentage of all injuries (29 percent), persons aged 25-44 years account for 37 percent of the total lifetime costs of injury.\n\n• Drowning/near-drowning have the highest average lifetime cost at $61,866 per person followed by suicide/self-harm at $51,540 per person.\n\n• Elderly persons over the age of 75 years have the highest direct treatment costs averaging $5,048 per injured person. This is due mainly to the high number of falls suffered in this age group.\n\n• Most injuries, at all levels of severity, occur in the home.\n\n• In terms of activity, sports and leisure activities are responsible for the greatest number of nonfatal injuries.\n\nRecommendations have emerged from this study for the prevention and control of injury in Victoria.\n\n• It is clear that, in terms of cost alone, injury is responsible for an enormous burden to the state of Victoria. It is recommended that more resources be directed towards the prevention of injuries and the reduction of their effects through the application of existing knowledge and the development and evaluation of new strategies.\n\n• It is recommended that research and controlled experiments be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost savings of a range of injury control interventions and that programs are shown to be cost-effective be implemented.\n\n• There is evidence for the effectiveness of a number of injury prevention strategies. It is recommended that research be conducted to evaluate the economic and/or societal barriers to the application of such strategies.\n\nSeveral other recommendations are made regarding data issues and further research into the epidemiology and cost of injury that supports the development of priorities and the prevention of injuries in Victoria.\n\nInjury has been identified as a major public health problem in Australia and internationally (Nutbeam et al, 1993). Although injury accounted for only 5.7 percent of all deaths in Australia in 1994 (NISU, 1996), it is the leading cause of death of persons aged between 1 and 44 years, accounting for 38 percent of deaths in children (1-14 years) and 72 percent of deaths in the 15-24 year old age-group (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1995) . It is also the single leading cause of inpatient hospital episodes in this country (Gillet, Liu & Solon, 1993). Although the cost of injury imposes an enormous burden on society little has been published on the total economic cost of injury in Australia. A 1986 figure of $11 billion per year is still quoted as the best available estimate (Better Health Commission, 1986) of the total cost of the burden of injury to Australia.\n\nThere are several purposes in establishing the economic consequences of injury. The first is to assess the burden of injury to the community. While it is extremely difficult to quantify all aspects of the burden injury imposes on society, it is important to translate this burden into economic terms in order to facilitate decision making in relation to the appropriate resourcing of the research and intervention effort in this area.\n\nIt also provides another way of highlighting the significance of a particular injury, over and above the usual epidemiological measures of mortality and morbidity. Injuries resulting from falls, for example, may not result in as many deaths as say, road traffic accidents, but as a major source of hospitalisations and possibly long-term disability, injuries from falls may result in significant reductions in the quality of life and the consumption of health care resources.\n\nThe cost of injury also provides important baseline information necessary for establishing benefits-cost estimates for intervention strategies. This only applies to incidence-based estimates, however, since these model the 'do nothing' or, current care, option against which new interventions can be assessed.\n\nIt should be noted that while economic costs are important in determining research and prevention priorities, decisions on the allocation of resources should also take into account the frequency and rate of injury, injury severity and the availability and effectiveness of interventions.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to provide an estimate of the total economic cost of injury to the Victorian community and to determine, to the extent possible, who pays.\n\n(1)\n\nTo conduct an international literature review of studies on the cost of injury.\n\n(2) To broadly describe the epidemiology of injury in Victoria at all levels of severity by means of analyses of available databases to determine the role of health professionals such as chiropractors, physiotherapists, etc. (for whom no data is currently available).\n\n(3) To articulate a methodology for attributing treatment and non-treatment costs of injuries.\n\n(4) To estimate the treatment costs related to injury in Victoria for the financial year 1993-94 within the limitations of the available data and to establish, where possible, who actually pays these costs.\n\n(5) To estimate the other (non-treatment) costs of injury to Victoria in 1993-94 within the limitations of the available data and to identify, where possible, who actually pays these costs.\n\n(6)\n\nTo the extent possible, on the basis of the findings, provide recommendations as to areas where possible savings may be made if relevant injury prevention strategies were implemented.\n\nA review of the international literature on cost of illness theory, methodology and practice revealed a variety of methods for estimating cost, making direct comparisons between studies difficult. The methodology chosen in a particular costing exercise will depend on several factors. The perspective chosen by the researchers will determine the type of costs included and the way in which the findings are expressed. For example, those interested solely in the impact of a particular injury on medical spending will only be concerned with direct treatment costs and will ignore quality of life issues. As Miller and Levy (1997) point out, it is \"generally desirable to present a societal perspective that takes into account costs and benefits to all members of society.\" While this is the most relevant for public decision-making, the extent to which this can be achieved is often solely determined by the availability and quality of data.\n\nFundamental to developing estimates of the economic cost of injury are reliable epidemiological data by age and gender (and cause categories if considering the whole spectrum of injury). Cost of illness studies can be undertaken using either a prevalence-or incidence-based approach.\n\nThe prevalence approach estimates the total cost of a disease or injury in a given year, irrespective of onset. The incidence approach estimates the lifetime cost of cases first diagnosed (or injuries sustained) in a the base year. The incidence approach is more demanding in terms of data since it requires estimates to be made about the course of treatment and the length of disability. However, it is more useful than the prevalence approach as estimates calculated in this way give a baseline against which new interventions can be assessed.\n\nIncidence-based estimates model the 'do nothing', or current care, option. Prevalence basedstudies, on the other hand, do not have this advantage and should be viewed as stand-alone exercises unless the full effects of a potential intervention are likely to be felt within a single year (Drummond, 1992).\n\nTwo main types of societal cost of injuries can be identified. These are (1) the economic costs and (2) the human costs.\n\nThese include direct costs which represent the actual expenditure related to the injury and include medical and non-medical costs such as hospital (inpatient and Emergency Department), medical (general & specialist services) and rehabilitation (rehabilitation services, aids and equipment) costs associated with the treatment of injury. Other direct costs include ambulance transport, pharmaceuticals and treatment by health professionals other than medical doctors. They may also include the cost of caring for an injured person at home such as attendant care or visits by a nursing service as well as the services of family and friends who care for the injured.\n\nLegal costs and property damage may be included. However, information about these costs is not available for all causes of injury. While data for property damage, for example, is probably available for road traffic accidents and house fires in Victoria, it is not available for other injury events. Property damage and legal costs can account for a significant proportion of the total cost of an injury event (Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics, 1992).\n\nEconomic costs also include indirect costs which represent the value of lost output due to reduced productivity caused by injury and any resultant disability (morbidity) and losses due to premature death (mortality). These costs are usually estimated using the human capital approach (described below).\n\nOther approaches to the costing of illness, such as the willingness-to-pay method, incorporate other aspects of well-being such as the value of leisure, pain and suffering. Some authors (eg. Koopmanschap, 1994) argue it is more appropriate to consider these non-monetary costs (pain, suffering, etc.) as health effects and to quantify them in terms of reduced quality of life so reducing the risks of double counting (both as costs and health effects). The estimated value of the foregone quality of life due to injury is often described by a measure of health status such as the quality adjusted life year, or QALY. QALYs (and variants, such as the World Health Organisation and World Bank's disability adjusted life years; Murray, 1994) are scales that value a year in any given health state between death and perfect health. QALYs reflect not only years of life saved but also the degree of functioning and health during those years (Miller & Levy, 1997).\n\nConceptual questions are the greatest source of uncertainty in indirect cost estimates. The most complex and controversial issues arise in determining the 'value of life'.\n\n'Much of the controversy.... is based on a neglect of the difference between a particular, individual life and an anonymous, statistical life. Western society places a very high value on the individual, as demonstrated, for example, by the very great efforts which are sometimes devoted to rescuing individuals in distress. Such efforts are dictated by moral considerations and are not subject to benefit-cost analyses.\n\nInvestment in safety measures is a very different question because the beneficiaries are the anonymous, potential victims of future random events. Their moral status is quite different from that of particular individuals in distress. The view taken in cost of illness or injury studies is that life generally, and improvements in human health, have finite values and that estimates of these values can be made.'\n\nTwo main approaches are commonly used in determining the indirect costs associated with injury -the human capital approach and the willingness-to-pay approach.\n\nAlthough they are fundamentally different in their approach and essentially measure different things both impute a 'value' to human life.\n\nDespite many criticisms, the human capital approach is still the most commonly used method for valuing the foregone productivity, or indirect cost, of illness or injury. The human capital approach values people in terms of their production. An individual is seen as producing over time a stream of output valued at market earnings or by the imputed worth of housekeeping services (Rice et al., 1989). This earnings stream is cut short by premature death or reduced due to recuperation and/or incapacity following an injury.\n\nThe mortality cost is the value of lost productivity resulting from injury deaths, calculated as the product of the number of injury-caused deaths and the present value of future production. Lost productivity can include both paid and unpaid production costs.\n\nPaid production (lifetime earnings) is usually derived from average or median earnings for fulltime employees plus labour on-costs. Earnings specific to age and gender are then applied to the number of years remaining in the labour force as a discounted earnings stream and adjusted for annual productivity gains over the relevant period to produce an estimate of lost production at present values. These figures are further adjusted to take into account the varying labour force participation rates for each age and gender group.\n\nA large amount of unpaid household and voluntary community work is performed by both employed and non-employed persons. When a person dies or is incapacitated this production is also foregone and represents a social cost. The BTCE (1992) used the opportunity cost approach in valuing the unpaid production component of their estimates of the value of future production. This method assumes that the worker has given up paid work in order to perform unpaid work and hence household and community work is valued in terms of earnings foregone, as measured by median weekly earnings by age and gender. The value of foregone family and community work was calculated using the working life tables. The hours of unpaid work were converted to an annual wage and added to the age and gender specific calculation of foregone earnings to produce the total value of future production.\n\nThe morbidity cost is an estimate of the productive capacity is lost to the community while an injured person is hospitalised or unable to perform their normal activities. Comprehensive information on the length of the period of total or partial disability as a result of injury is not always available. Length of stay in hospital (with a weighting to allow for recuperation) and the number of attendances for treatment (in the case of non-hospitalised injury) are often used for estimating the period over which productive capacity is lost or reduced. Morbidity costs are calculated in a similar way to mortality costs as a product of the time lost by the appropriate wage rate (by age and gender).\n\nThe human capital approach has the important advantage of employing data that is reliable and readily available. The human capital approach is relatively straightforward in its application and, until recently, it had been thought to give more consistent results than the willingness-to-pay approach. Consequently the human capital approach has been used in all past Australian studies of road accident costs. The BTCE (1992) used this approach in its estimates of the costs of Australian road accidents for 1988. Implicit in these results is a value of human life of $616,000 (in 1992 dollars). 1\n\nThere are, however, several criticisms of the human capital approach to valuing human life. In different studies the dependence of earnings on age, sex and employment status have been taken into account in different ways. Other aspects of the approach which have been subject to debate include whether gross output or net output of expected lifetime consumption is the appropriate measure, whether income or earnings should be used as the measure of output and whether, and how, to value non-market output such as family, home and community work.\n\nAnother criticism of this method is that it estimates the value of potential production lost and therefore overestimates the actual loss to society. Given that short-term absences from work may be covered by others or made up on return to work, and long-term absences may be covered by someone drawn from the ranks of the unemployed, absences from work may cost the individual or their employer, but cost society very little (Drummond, 1992). Consequently, the human capital approach will overestimate indirect costs in an economy with less than full employment. In such cases, the emerging friction cost method may provide a better estimate of the impact of production loss to society but this approach requires further development (Koopmanschap, 1994). While this method may better determine the actual loss of production, it is not capable of determining the societal burden of injury.\n\nConversely, because its valuation of human life is based on market earnings, the human capital approach yields low values for children and retired elderly persons. Many injury victims fall into these categories. The human capital approach also undervalues life if labour market imperfections exist and wages do not reflect true abilities. For example, women and minorities are often paid wages that are lower than the value of what they produce (Rice et al., 1989).\n\nCertain dimensions of illness and death, such as pain, suffering and reduced quality of life, are also ignored. The human capital approach, does not accurately reflect the way people value their own or others' lives. Most people value safety more out of an aversion to injury or death than out of a wish to preserve future levels of income (Jones- Lee, 1990). Other approaches to the costing of illness and injury, such as the willingness-to-pay method, incorporate not only the loss of income but also the human costs such as reduced quality of life and pain and suffering.\n\nThe willingness-to-pay approach values human life according to the amount individuals are willing to pay for a change that reduces the probability of illness or death (Schelling, 1968). This approach assumes an individual perspective and incorporates all aspects of well-being, including labour and non-labour income, and the value of leisure, pain and suffering.\n\nPeople regularly express their valuation of risk and safety through their purchases of safety equipment or their acceptance of higher wages (danger money) for dangerous jobs. Such behaviour can be interpreted as implying a value of life which can be determined by (hedonic pricing) analyses of the amounts paid, or accepted as compensation, for changes in exposure to risk. Alternatively, similar information can be obtained (through contingent valuation surveys) 1\n\nThe estimate assumed a discount rate of 7 percent per year, productivity improvements of 2 percent per year, and included both foregone earnings and family and community losses.\n\nabout more precisely specified situations, by asking people how much they would be willing to pay to avoid different levels of risk.\n\nValue of life determined on the willingness to pay to reduce risk is generally much higher than from the human capital approach. Miller (1989) assessed 49 studies and concluded that 29 of them were reasonably sound in methodology. Miller and Guria (1991) reported that range of the results from these studies was from $1.3 to $4.8 million with a mean of $2.8 million (in 1992 Australian dollars).\n\nThere is only one study using Australian data from which the value of life based on willingness to pay can be estimated. Kniesner and Leeth (1991) examined wage differentials in manufacturing industry in 1984-85, and related these to fatality rates in a hedonic pricing study. They found that workers exposed to the mean fatality risk (1.4 fatalities per 10,000 workers per year) received a premium $701 per year compared to workers in a completely safe industrial setting. According to RCG/Hagler Bailey (1994) this can be interpreted as implying a value per statistical life of $5.0 million (in 1991-92 Australian dollars).\n\nThe willingness to pay approach is now generally accepted by economists as theoretically the most valid approach to valuing life, and preferable to the human capital approach. Based on the findings of a willingness to pay survey carried out in 1989-90 (Miller & Guria, 1991), the New Zealand Ministry of Transport decided that the value of statistical life should be $NZ 2 million at 1 April, 1991 prices and that it should be indexed to the average ordinary wage rate. Guria (1993) subsequently prepared social cost estimates of traffic injuries by severity, based on the willingness to pay approach, for use by the New Zealand Land Transport Safety Authority in the economic evaluation of safety programs and policies.\n\nCurrently in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and, to some extent, Denmark use the willingness to pay method for valuing transport fatalities. In the UK willingness-to-pay is also used for valuing non-fatal serious injuries (European Transport Safety Council, 1997). The Office of the US Secretary of Transportation (BTCE, 1994) has also adopted this method, more than doubling the previous estimates of the value of life. According to Miller, willingness-to-pay estimates of the value of life are also used by other government agencies in the US such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture (Miller & Guria, 1991).\n\nDetermining the value of life by the willingness to pay method inherits the strengths and weaknesses of hedonic pricing and contingent evaluation. In addition there are a number of unsettled methodological issues relating to such matters as the ability of people to make informed decisions about small risks, the perception of risk, and whether valuations should be augmented to reflect willingness to pay for someone else's safety. However, the overriding objection to the willingness-to-pay method is that it requires substantial development prior to implementation, thereby limiting efforts to apply it (Rice et al., 1989). Consequently, it has not been used to date in any injury costing studies in Australia.\n\nThere is a major debate within the cost-of injury literature regarding the most appropriate methodology for the determining the indirect cost of injury.\n\nWhile there is dispute about the way productivity losses are measured, there are also ethical objections to its inclusion in costing studies. If the relative economic burden of injury or disease includes productivity losses, and this data is used as the sole determinant for priority setting, then more resources will be devoted to the care of people of working age or of certain occupations. This does not sit well with the notion of equity in health-care (Drummond, 1992). The most recent version of the Australian guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals suggests that results should be presented both with, and without, indirect benefits and costs included, but emphasises that the value of work time gained and lost should be made explicit (Henry, 1992).\n\nWhile recognising the limitations of the human capital approach, it is still considered the most appropriate methodology for this study given the availability and reliability of data, the possibility of comparison with other studies particularly in the road trauma area (eg. BTCE, 1992) and the difficulty of applying other approaches given their current state of development.\n\nIt must be recognised, however, that the human capital approach results in much smaller estimates of the value of life, compared with the willingness to pay approach. This can have a very substantial impact on subsequent benefits/cost analysis and this major issue should not be overlooked in policy decisions. Economic losses to society may be approximated by lost productivity however, the discounted future earnings figure arrived at by the human capital approach generally underestimates the total perceived loss to the individual. Human capital estimates represent the absolute lower boundary of willingness-to-pay estimates, but may only be within a factor of 2 or 3 (perhaps even 5 or 10) of what a person or his/her family feel they actually lose if death or permanent disablement occur as a result of injury (Hartunian, Smart & Thompson, 1975).\n\nSince the willingness-to-pay approach to valuing indirect cost is becoming more common, estimates of this cost in relation to injury in Victoria are provided in Chapter 8 for reference purposes.\n\nLittle work has been done in Australia to develop appropriate estimates. Consequently, the figures presented here have been derived from estimates established in overseas studies.\n\nAlthough the cost of injury imposes an enormous burden on society little has been published on the total economic cost of injury in Australia. A 1986 figure of $11 billion per year is still quoted as the best available estimate (Better Health Commission, 1986) of the total cost of the burden of injury to Australia.\n\nAt least two studies have developed estimates of the direct treatment cost of injury in Australia. A study by Monash University Accident Research Centre (Watson and Ozanne-Smith, 1995) estimated that the treatment costs associated with unintentional injury alone (excluding medical misadventure and the adverse effects of prescription drugs) amounted to $1.79 billion for Australia in 1992-93. This study relied on a \"bottom-up\" approach using injury surveillance data and individual service costs.\n\nRecent estimates by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare suggest that the direct treatment cost for all injury (intentional and unintentional) accounted for around $2.6 billion dollars in 1993-94 (Mathers, Penm, Carter & Stevenson,1997). This study was based on a \"topdown\" approach and estimated the direct cost of health services by taking known recurrent expenditures on health services from the national accounts and apportioning them to disease categories (on the basis of the ICD-9 CM chapters) using data on utilisation of health services by disease type and costs per service. A comparison between different causes of illness in this study showed that injury ranks fourth behind circulatory, musculo-skeletal and mental disorders in terms of direct health care costs (Mathers, Penm, Carter & Stevenson, 1997).\n\nHowever, direct treatment costs account for only a proportion of the total cost of injury. In the US, the total lifetime cost of injuries incurred in 1985 was estimated to be $US 158 billion. The direct cost of injury (includes all medical care costs and selected non-medical costs) accounted for 29% of the lifetime cost of injury, while indirect costs such as morbidity costs (the value of goods and services not produced because of injury-related illness and disability) and mortality costs (losses due to premature death) accounted for 41% and 30% respectively of the total (Rice, MacKenzie & Associates, 1989).\n\nWhile the 1986 figure of $11 billion per year is still quoted as the best available estimate of the total cost of the burden of injury to Australia (Better Health Commission, 1986), the cost of road accidents alone was estimated at $6.1 billion for Australia in 1993 (BTCE, 1994). Estimates by the Industry Commission (1995) of the total cost of workplace injury for 1992-93 was $20 billion. While these estimates vary in the type of costs included, it is clear that the total cost of injury to Australia is considerable.\n\nFundamental to developing estimates of the economic cost of injury are data on incidence by major age, sex and cause categories. Estimates of the numbers and rates of injury are presented in this report for three mutually exclusive groups that broadly reflect the severity of injury : (1) injury resulting in death, (2) injury resulting in hospitalisation with survival to discharge, and (3) injury requiring medical attention without hospitalisation. Injuries for which medical attention was not sought have been excluded from this study since there is no data available on the frequency of such cases. Estimates of incidence and economic cost reported here are for the financial year 1993/94, the most recent year for which reliable incidence data for each level of injury severity were available.\n\nWithin each level of severity (fatal, hospitalised and non-hospitalised), incidence estimates were developed for each of seven age groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74 and 75 years and over), two gender groups and thirteen categories of cause based on the major ICD-9 categories : ten unintentional (motor vehicle traffic, other transport, drowning, poisoning, falls, fire & flames, hit/struck/crushed, cutting, asphyxia and other) and two intentional (self-harm and interpersonal violence), and unknown intent.\n\nBecause important segments such as sporting, home and workplace injuries are concealed by the ICD-9 disaggregation, incidence estimates for each level of injury severity were also developed for the settings in which injury events occur and the activity being undertaken at the time of injury. The eleven setting categories are : manufacturing, commercial, transport, sporting, recreational, residential, institutional, educational, farming, other specified and unspecified settings. Eleven activity categories were also defined. These are : sport, leisure, paid work, other work/household activities, education, personal activities/care, transportation, self-harm, interpersonal violence, other specified activities and unspecified activities.\n\nThe major data sources used in estimating the number of injuries that occurred in Victoria in 1993/94 were the Victorian Coroners Facilitation System (VCFS) for deaths, the Victorian Inpatient Minimum Dataset (VIMD) for live hospital discharges and the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) and the Extended Latrobe Valley Injury Surveillance (ELVIS) for less severe, non-hospitalised injuries.\n\nThese were supplemented by information from the National Injury Surveillance Unit (NISU) for doctor certified deaths and the Victorian Injury Surveillance System (VISS) for non-hospitalised injury. Some minor to moderately severe injury may not present to hospitals or general practitioners. For example, some injuries, particularly musculo-skeletal injuries, generally present to sports medicine or workplace clinics or may present directly to allied health practitioners such as chiropractors, osteopaths or physiotherapists. Such cases have been excluded from this study since there is no data available on the frequency of these attendances. This will result in an underestimation of costs.\n\nThe completeness and validity of injury data are fundamentally important to the accuracy of cost of injury estimates. While some checks were possible within this study, not all data could be validated. Comparison of information between databases often results in more questions than answers since reconciliation of any discrepancies requires more resources than were available to this study.\n\nAge-and gender-specific estimates for the 1993 Victorian resident population are used in calculating rates of injury per 100,000.\n\nThe resident population estimates at 30/6/93 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1993) are included in Appendix Table C1.\n\nThe main source of data for determining the number of injury deaths is the Victorian Coroners Facilitation System (VCFS), a record of all unnatural deaths occurring in Victoria which the State Coroner has investigated and for which a finding has been recorded. An injury death is defined as any death with an underlying cause of injury as defined by the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 CM, Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities, 1986), E-codes 800-999 excluding E870-E879 (misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care) and E930-E949 (drugs, medical and biological substances causing adverse effects in therapeutic use). This definition includes all traumatic injuries, burns, poisonings and drownings (see Appendix Table A1). It should be noted that deaths with injury noted only as a contributing factor and not as the underlying cause are excluded from the definition.\n\nTo establish incidence, the date of the injury event, rather than the date of death, is the preferred criterion for inclusion. In extracting data from the VCFS, cases were included in the analysis on the basis of date of injury (occurring in the base year 1993/94). However, VCFS data is currently only available for deaths occurring up to, and including June 30, 1994. No hard data is currently available on the number of deaths occurring in later years due to injuries inflicted in 1993/94. These were estimated using percentages derived from Max, Rice and MacKenzie (1990).\n\nThe dataset also does not include cases for which the Coroner had not determined a finding at the time the data were released. Around 5 percent of cases for this period were still awaiting a finding. These are published in Unnatural Deaths 1993/94 2 by cause and intent. To determine the numbers in age and gender groups the distribution from the VCFS database was applied and the estimated number of cases in each age and gender group was then added to the deaths in the database. Around 10 percent of injury deaths, mainly cases of elderly falls victims, (which the Coroner is not required to investigate) are certified by doctors. Information on these cases was provided by NISU from death certificate data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These cases are included on the basis of date of death, because NISU does not hold data on the date of injury.\n\nIt has been clear for some time that the recording of falls deaths is problematic. While the addition of NISU/ABS doctor certified deaths to the Coronial data provides a more complete picture, a comparison with hospital data contained in the VIMD suggests that the number of deaths in patients who had sustained a fall may be twice that officially recorded. However, the problem lies in attributing death to the fall. Because falls often occur in the elderly and may result in long hospitalisation, complications of existing conditions and co-morbidity, death may not or can not be officially attributed to the fall. Because of the problems associated with attribution, only those deaths officially attributed to injury have been used in this study and therefore the costs derived maybe underestimated. Restricting the definitions to deaths with an 2\n\nTable CRN 4.5, p. 253, Unnatural Deaths, collated from the findings of the State Coroner, 1993/94. State Coroner's Office, Victoria.\n\nunderlying cause of injury underestimates the total number of injury-related deaths, especially among the elderly and particularly in relation to falls. However, since it is difficult to ascribe the death in these cases to the injury per se, the more conservative definition is used.\n\nIn view of the suspected large number of deaths which may have been ignored, there would be considerable merit in a further study to estimate the number of these cases.\n\nThe incidence of hospitalised injury cases was derived from the Victorian Inpatient Minimum Dataset (VIMD). The VIMD is a prevalence-based collection which records all separations from all Victorian public and private hospitals. Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) holds a subset of the VIMD containing information about all injury hospitalisations in the State.\n\nFor the purpose of this study an injury-related hospitalisation was defined as a live discharge (therefore deaths in hospital are excluded) with an injury cause code between E800 and E999 excluding medical misadventure (E870-E879) and the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in therapeutic use (E930-E949). Cases were selected if admission occurred in the base year (1993/94), the assumption being that admission date is a reliable surrogate for date of injury. Selecting injury admissions in the VIMD solely on this basis however, overestimates the incidence of injury resulting in hospitalisation. This occurs for several reasons.\n\nFirst, re-admissions of a patient to the same hospital for the same external cause of injury will be counted twice. Such cases are identifiable because they have the same encrypted admission number, postcode, E-code gender and date of birth. Almost five percent of injury cases (3,692) were re-admissions to the same hospital within 30 days. These were excluded from the count of injury hospitalisations.\n\nTransfers from one hospital to another will also be counted twice. Although it is not possible to link transfers in the VIMD because patient identification has been removed, a more realistic estimate of the actual incidence of hospitalisations due to injury in the base year can be obtained by excluding those patients where the admission source is identified as the samefoot_0 or another hospital. A further five percent (3,584) of the remaining cases were excluded on this basis.\n\nAnother potentially important source of overestimation is the inclusion of cases who are rehospitalised for follow-up care of a previous injury (which may not have occurred in the base year or may occur more than 30 days after the initial admission). There is presently no way of accurately identifying these cases since, with patient identifiers removed, there is no reliable way of linking episodes of care for individual patients. Hospitalisations classified by principal diagnosis as \" traumatic complications\" (N958) or \"late effects\" of injury (N905-N909) may fall into this group. However, an analysis of the 1993/94 data showed that \"traumatic complications\" of injury accounted for less than 0.3 percent of the 67,402 injury hospitalisations while there were no cases of \"late effects\" of injury recorded.\n\nSince hospitalised injuries are known to account for the greatest proportion of the direct cost of injury (Rice et al., 1989, p.50), these injuries were further disaggregated by nature and body region of injury to provide greater accuracy in assigning costs between causes. Injury data, however, is currently collected differently by different sectors in Victoria. Thus, although the occupational injury database of the WorkCover authority is a rich source of outcome and cost data, its lack of ICD coding created a problem for this study. A mapping process was conducted to overcome this difficulty based on nature of injury and body part so that costs derived from WorkCover data could be applied more sensitively to the available hospitalised injury data. A 13 X 11 matrix of nature of injury by body region was developed based on the ICD-9 CM diagnosis codes for injury (N800-N999) to map onto a similar matrix developed for WorkCover payments data. To develop costings across each injury cause, age and gender group required the generation of 182 matrices (one for each age-group x gender x injury cause cell in the summary tables). An example of the matrix is provided in Appendix Table B3 (overall incidence of injury hospitalisations).\n\nAn estimate of the number of totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) injury cases in Victoria in 1993/94 was derived by applying the percentage of TPI cases in the WorkCover database to cases of working age in the VIMD using the injury matrix.\n\nThe number of patients who were admitted to nursing homes following an injury event resulting in hospitalisation was derived from the VIMD. Only those patients who were admitted to hospital, but who were not institutionalised prior to injury, were included in the incidence figure. It is likely that there were nursing home admissions, especially among the elderly, following nonhospitalised injury events, but there are no data on which to base an estimate.\n\nThe incidence of spinal cord injury resulting in paraplegia and quadriplegia was estimated to provide costings for these major areas of ongoing cost. Data on the age, gender and cause distribution of traumatic spinal cord injury in Victoria for 1996 were provided by Victorian Spinal Cord Services at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre.\n\nEstimates of the number of minor injuries resulting in medical attention without hospitalisation are derived from several sources and consist of two components : hospital Emergency Department presentations and General Practitioner attendances.\n\nThe number of non-hospitalised injury cases presenting to Emergency Departments in Victoria in 1993/94 was estimated using the number of hospital admissions from Emergency Departments recorded in the VIMD as the basis for calculation. This figure was multiplied by the admissions to presentations ratio derived from 1996 data from a sample of 24 Victorian hospitals covered by the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD). The total estimate was then broken down into injury cause categories, age and gender, setting and activity groups using the distributions in the 1996 VEMD presentations data. A comparison of motor vehicle traffic injury attendances at Victorian Emergency Departments established in this study with an estimate of road injury attendances in 1990/91 (O'Connor & KPMG Peat Marwick, 1993) shows similar figures. (26,584 cases estimated in this study for 1993/94 compared to 23,991 in 1990/91).\n\nThere is no statewide database that collects information regarding General Practitioner (GP) attendances.\n\nHowever, information about injuries treated by GPs in the Latrobe Valley was collected for a twelve-month period (7/11/94 to 6/11/95) through the Extended Latrobe Valley Injury Surveillance (ELVIS) system. Information about Emergency Department attendances was collected concurrently by the Victorian Injury Surveillance System through the Emergency Departments of the Latrobe Regional Hospital.\n\nThe ratio of general practice to Emergency Department attendances in the Latrobe Valley is estimated to be 1.2 : 1 (Day, Valuri & Ozanne-Smith, 1997, p. 17).\n\nThis ratio is similar to the 1:1 ratio determined by McClure & Ozanne-Smith (1996) in a study of the epidemiology of injury in the Australian Capital Territory in 1992. By applying a median point between these two studies of 1.1 : 1, the number of injury-related, non-hospitalised GP attendances for Victoria in 1993/94, was derived from the estimated number of Emergency Department attendances. The total number of non-hospitalised GP attendances was then distributed between injury cause, age, gender, setting and activity groups on the basis of the distributions observed in the ELVIS data.\n\nIt should be noted that the Latrobe Valley may not be representative of the rest of Victoria given that the majority of the population reside in Melbourne. However, it is currently the only data available on GP attendances for injury in a Victorian population. As identified by that study (Day, Valuri & Ozanne-Smith 1997), injured persons in the Latrobe Valley were more likely to attend a G.P. rather than a hospital because: they preferred to see a doctor they knew (32%), the injury was not severe enough to attend hospital (25%), the G.P. was closer to home than the hospital (14%) or the waiting time was shorter then the hospital (12%). However, patients transported from the scene of an accident by ambulance, irrespective of the severity of the injury, will always be conveyed to a hospital Emergency Department.\n\nData from the VCFS for 1993/94 were used to establish injury setting and activity at time of injury fatalities.\n\nBecause ICD-9 CM does not categorise injuries into many important settings such as sport, work, school, farm and so on, the VIMD does not provide detail of the setting, or activity being undertaken at the time of injury that results in hospitalisation. Thus indirect means were required to identify the proportion of cases occurring in these settings. Estimates of the number of hospitalised injuries for each setting or activity group were established by applying proportions derived from admitted patients recorded in the VEMD in 1996. Although the WorkCover data is known to represent an underestimate of the total number of hospitalised workplace injuriesfoot_1 , the number of cases injured at work was taken directly from the WorkCover data as this was the best data available (given the large proportion of cases of unknown and unspecified activity in the VEMD).\n\nData from the VEMD and ELVIS were used to establish an estimate of the number of cases for each setting and activity category attending hospital Emergency Departments and general practitioners which were combined to provide the total estimates of non-hospitalised cases in each category\n\nThis study follows the work of the Rice et al. (1989) and the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics (BTCE, 1992) in that it uses the ex-post human capital approach to estimate the indirect costs associated with injury, by assigning an economic value to the loss of life and productive capacity resulting from injury. The total cost estimated using this method depends on the cost elements taken into account and how these elements are calculated.\n\nIn contrast to the BTCE (1992), which used the accident as the basic costing unit, in this study the basic costing unit is the injured person. The framework for estimating the total cost in this study consists of costs relating to the treatment of injury (direct costs), costs relating to the loss, or partial loss, to society of the productive efforts (both paid and unpaid) of injury victims and care-givers in the case of children (indirect costs).\n\nDirect costs are the actual expenditure related to the injury and include medical and non-medical costs such as hospital (inpatient and Emergency Department), medical (general & specialist services) and rehabilitation (rehabilitation services, aids and equipment) costs associated with the treatment of injury. Other direct costs include ambulance transport, pharmaceuticals and treatment by health professionals other than medical doctors. They may also include the cost of caring for an injured person at home such as attendant care or visits by a nursing service. No attempt was made to value the services of family and friends (beyond the productive loss to caregivers of child injury victims) who care for the injured, because of the lack of data available in relation to this area. However, this 'informal care' cost is likely to be significant as indicated by case studies included in the study by Rice et al (1989).\n\nLegal costs and property damage are excluded because they are costs associated with the injury event rather than the injury itself and information about these costs is not available for all causes of injury. That is, the costs are injured person-rather that event-or accident-based. While data for property damage, for example, is probably available for road traffic accidents and house fires in Victoria, it is not available for other injury events. As indicated by the BTCE (1992) study, property damage can account for a significant proportion of the total cost of an injury event (30 percent).\n\nIndirect costs represent the value of lost output due to reduced productivity caused by injury and any resultant disability (morbidity) and losses due to premature death (mortality). Loss or partial loss of future production has been estimated in terms of earnings and labour on-costs of injury victims, the productive but unpaid contribution of victims to their households and communities and the productive time lost by caregivers of child injury victims. Compensation costs relating to pain and suffering have not been included.\n\nThe aforementioned factors comprise the framework for the estimation of injury-related costs. The estimate of the total cost of injury to Victoria in 1993/94 has been generated from the actual or estimated incidence of injury in that year. The estimates will therefore be affected by the accuracy or otherwise of these data. Costs are estimated for three levels of injury severity : fatalities, hospitalised injuries and non-hospitalised injuries. It is reasonable to expect that injury data becomes less reliable as the degree of injury severity decreases since many moderate to minor injuries are self-treated or treated by allied health professionals. As mentioned in the previous chapter, such cases are not identified in the current injury surveillance systems. While the individual cost of such injuries will generally be small, their number is likely to be large and therefore their aggregate cost substantial, resulting in an under-estimation of the total cost of injury.\n\nIn this study payments data have been used as surrogates for resource costs. This approach is commonly used in the cost-of-illness literature (Rice et al., 1989). It is recognised, however, that due to market imperfections in the health sector, payments may not reflect costs completely accurately.\n\nComprehensive payment data (on deaths, hospitalised and non-hospitalised cases) has been provided for this study by the Victorian WorkCover Authority (VWA) and the Transport Accident Commission (TAC). Contained in their databases is information about a range of direct costs including hospital, medical, allied health and rehabilitation treatment as well as attendant care, and ambulance, etc. Information about income support, lump sum payments and long term outcomes is also available. All payments made by these authorities to December 31, 1996 in relation to transport accident and occupational injuries that occurred in 1993/94 have been included in the average costs used for each payment category in this study. While there will still be further costs incurred for those cases which have resulted in permanent or long-term disability, it is assumed that the major part of treatment costs have been incurred during this period.\n\nVery little work has been done in Australia on the long-term cost of injury. For the purpose of this study an estimate of the direct treatment costs for severe spinal cord injury, for which incidence and cost data is available, has been included. An estimate of nursing home costs (based on discharges to nursing homes from acute care hospitals) has also been included in the hospitalisation costs. Morbidity cost estimates for hospitalised patients include those for totally and permanently incapacitated persons, severe spinal cord injury as well as nursing home admissions (adjustments being made to avoid double-counting).\n\nFor non-hospitalised injury cases, the cost data supplied by the TAC and the VWA were supplemented by information about service fees from the Health Insurance Commission's Medicare & Pharmaceutical Benefits Statistical Tables.\n\nData used in establishing lost production values have been derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics publications, on-line information service and from the BTCE (1992) study on the cost of transport accidents in Australia.\n\nAn outline of the estimation procedure for each cost element, for each level of injury severity, is detailed in the following sections.\n\nThe cost of fatal injury consists of direct cost and mortality cost. All injury fatalities are included in this category and not in the hospitalised and non-hospitalised categories.\n\nBecause of the small number of injury-related death claims in the WorkCover database, the average cost of a motor vehicle traffic death (from the TAC) was been applied to all 1993/94 deaths to provide an estimate of the direct costs (medical and non-medical) associated with injuries resulting in death. These costs include : ambulance transport, hospital (inpatient and Emergency Department), medical (general and specialist), pharmaceuticals, allied health, rehabilitation (programs and equipment), personal and domestic assistance, etc. The same estimates were conservatively applied to later year deaths with the hospital component being adjusted to reflect greater length of stay (based on the average length of stay of later year deaths recorded in the VIMD). Applying the same treatment costs and using length of stay data only to 1995/96 will result in an underestimate of total direct costs for fatalities.\n\nThe mortality cost, or the value of foregone productivity due to early death, was also estimated. In addition to the deaths that occurred in the base year, 1993/94, a number of deaths occurred in later years due to injuries sustained in that year.\n\nMortality cost is the value of lost productivity resulting from injury deaths, calculated as the product of the number of injury-caused deaths and the present value of future production. Estimates of the value of future production by age and gender were derived from tables provided in the BTCE (1992) study adjusted by the annual CPI rise to reflect 1993 valuesfoot_2 (see Appendix Table D1). These values represent both paid and unpaid production components. This estimate of paid production (lifetime earnings) was derived from median weekly earnings for full-time employees in their main job plus labour on-costs of 21.2 percent. Earnings specific to age and gender were then applied to the number of years remaining in the labour force as a discounted (7 percent discount rate) earnings stream and adjusted for annual productivity gains (2 percent per annum) over the relevant period to produce an estimate of lost production at present values (1993/94). These figures were further adjusted to take into account the varying labour force participation rates for each age and gender group.\n\nA large amount of unpaid household and voluntary community work is performed by both employed and non-employed persons. When a person dies or is incapacitated this production is also foregone and represents a social cost. The BTCE (1992) used the opportunity cost approach in valuing the unpaid production component of their estimates of the value of future production. This method assumes that the worker has given up paid work in order to perform unpaid work and hence household and community work is valued in terms of earnings foregone, as measured by median weekly earnings by age and gender. The value of foregone family and community work was calculated using the working life tables. The hours of unpaid work were converted to an annual wage and added to the age and gender specific calculation of foregone earnings during working and retired life to produce the total value of future production.\n\nThe cost of hospitalised injury consists of direct cost and morbidity cost. This category represents only live patient discharges. Injured persons who die in hospital are included in the deaths category.\n\nTreatment payment data for motor vehicle traffic injuries was supplied by the Victorian Transport Accident Commission (TAC). This data consisted of the direct treatment and related costs of 5,374 persons hospitalised due to motor vehicle traffic accidents in Victoria in 1993/94 by agegroup and type of payment.\n\nCosts for all other injury causes were derived from payment data supplied by the Victorian WorkCover Authority (VWA) in the form of a matrix of body part by nature of injury. This data consisted of the direct treatment and related costs for 6,717 workers injured in Victoria in 1993/94 by payment type. While the reliability of the average cost derived for some cells is low, due to the small number of cases, because of the variability of injury types that occurs in different age and cause categories, applying costs on the basis of this matrix allows for greater discrimination between injury causes and age-groups than does applying a blanket average to all cases Matrices of injury incidence were derived from the VIMD for each of the 7 age-groups in each of the 13 injury cause groups. These were multiplied by the matrix of average costs for each payment type to establish a total cost for each cell in the age by gender by cause tables provided here. Where there were no payments in the WorkCover data for a particular injury type, the average cost for the relevant body part or nature of injury was applied. A medical excess of $378 applied to all VWA and TAC cases in 1993/94 and this cost was added to each case to arrive at the final costing.\n\nNursing home admissions as a result of injury were identified in the VIMD. Only those cases which were not admitted from a nursing home were included. The annual cost of nursing home care in 1996/97 was supplied by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Servicesfoot_3 . This figure was discounted by the annual CPI increase to provide an estimate of the annual cost in 1993/94. Life expectancy to age 75 was assumed to have been reduced by a factor of 2 as a result of trauma. This may be an overestimation but no data is currently available on life expectancy of trauma-related nursing home admissions. This cost was then applied to all cases on the basis of estimated life years remaining, discounted at 7 percent per annum to obtain 1993/94 values. Because 40 percent of elderly nursing home residents die within the first six months 7 of admission, all cases aged seventy-five years and over (almost 80 percent of cases admitted from hospital) were ascribed only six months of nursing home costs.\n\nNo data is available on the incidence of persisting spinal cord injury (SCI) from traumatic causes in Victoria in 1993/94. However, trend data published in a recent issue of the Australian Injury Prevention Bulletin (O'Connor & Cripps, 1997), indicate that annual age-adjusted incidence rates for Australia have not varied significantly between 1986-90 and 1995-6. Therefore, the incidence of traumatic persisting SCI in Victoria in 1996 was used as the basis for estimating the lifetime treatment costs of SCI from injuries incurred in 1993/94. These data were supplied by the Victorian Spinal Cord Services at the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre. Treatment cost estimates for severe spinal injury from a study by Walsh (1988), adjusted by the annual CPI rise to reflect 1993/94 prices. Given that the life expectancy of people with SCI now approaches that of the general population (Whiteneck et al, 1992), annual ongoing direct costs were applied to each case on the basis of life years remaining to age 75 years, discounted at 7 percent per annum to reflect 1993/94 prices.\n\nWhile an injured person is hospitalised or unable to perform their normal activities, productive capacity is lost to the community. Comprehensive information on the length of the period of total or partial disability as a result of injury is not available. In keeping with other studies, the length of stay in hospital has been used as the basis for estimating the period over which productive capacity is lost or reduced. While the BTCE (1992) assumed only one additional day of production lost for each day in hospital, its calculations are based on an average of 21 hospital bed-days estimated from TAC data for the base year 1988. Data from the VIMD, however, show that in 1993/94, the average length of stay was only 8 days for a motor vehicle traffic injury. While this may indicate some degree of over-counting of cases in the VIMD, because of the difficulty in linking episodes of care for individual patients, dividing the number of bed-days associated with motor vehicle traffic injuries (50,437) by the number of hospitalised TAC claimants in that year (5,374) still results in an average length of stay of only 9 days. Because of this discrepancy and the effect it would have on the total estimates (effectively reducing the total morbidity by a factor of 2.5 in comparison to the BTCE's study), this study follows the work of Collins and Lapsley (1991) in assigning two additional days of lost production for each day of hospitalisation.\n\nThe earnings estimates used in this study for each age and gender were derived from earnings from full-time employees in their main jobs. The figures used were based on median weekly earnings (ABS, 1994a) plus labour on-costs of 21.2 percent. The estimates take into account the labour force participation rate for each age and gender group (ABS, 1994b) assuming that the distribution of injury victims is similar to that of the population at large in terms of employment. For cases of unknown age and/or gender, the average lost earnings of victims of known age and gender were applied.\n\nSeparate calculations were made to estimate the paid production loss of care-givers of children under 15 years of age.\n\nThese figures were based on the median wages and work-force participation rates of women with children in this age range since women primarily undertake this role.\n\nA large amount of productive but unpaid work is performed by both employed and non-employed persons. This includes household work and voluntary community work. When a person is incapacitated this production is also lost to the community. Following the BTCE (1992), this study uses the opportunity cost approach to value unpaid production. It is assumed that the median weekly earnings by age and gender best describes the opportunity cost of performing household and community work. Therefore the value of unpaid production time lost is assumed to be equal that of production time lost in paid work. An estimate of the average time spent on labour force activities in a week by males and females was calculated from figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (1994c). Time spent on unpaid household and community work was taken from the 1992 Time Use Survey conducted by the ABS (1994d). Figures derived from the same sources were also used to calculate the value of unpaid production lost by unemployed victims of injury.\n\nSeparate calculations, based on the BTCE (1992) working life tables, were undertaken for victims of spinal cord injury, total and permanent incapacitation and nursing home admissions. Information about the labour force participation of persons with paraplegia and quadriplegia in Victoria (Murphy et al., 1997) was used to adjust the loss of earnings estimates for this group.\n\nFurther information regarding morbidity calculations and the formulae used to estimate both paid and unpaid production are detailed in Appendix E.\n\nThe cost of non-hospitalised injury consists of direct treatment costs and morbidity costs associated with lost earnings.\n\nBecause a medical excess of $378 applied to all TAC and VWA cases in 1993/94 on top of the average costs of $1,921 and $1,200 respectively, it was apparent the cases in these databases represented the more severe end of the non-hospitalised injury spectrum. The TAC and VWA payments for non-hospitalised injuries were therefore not typical of the majority of cases at this level of severity and therefore could not be applied to all cases.\n\nInformation on the distribution of the first, and one subsequent visit (or referral), to the Emergency Department or General Practitioner, as a result of injury, was available from the VEMD and ELVIS. This data represents the minimum number of medical attendances for injury in Victoria. Each visit was costed using service costs derived from Jackson, Sevil, Tate & Collard (1995), the Health Insurance Commission (1993-94) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners 7 The proportion of Medicare bulk-billing was taken into account when costing General Practitioner and specialist attendances (Health Insurance Commission, 1994, Table 9).\n\nThe average cost of a non-hospitalised injury derived from the TAC and the VWA was conservatively applied to 38.7 percent of specialist referrals 8 since these cases were assumed to represent the more serious end of the spectrum of severity for non-hospitalised cases. (An additional $378 was applied to each case to take into account the medical excess).  The number of non-hospitalised TAC cases as a proportion of the total number of non-hospitalised motor vehicle traffic injuries. It is also estimated that WorkCover (VWA) cases account for almost 40 percent of non-hospitalised, work-related injury.\n\nFollowing the BTCE (1992), only one day of lost earnings was ascribed to each case of nonhospitalised injury. Average daily earnings for each age and gender were derived from the weekly earnings of full-time employees in their main jobs. As described in the hospitalisation section (3.2.2.2), the figures used were based on median weekly earnings (ABS, 1994a) plus labour on-costs of 21.2 percent. The estimates take into account the labour force participation rate for each age and gender group (ABS, 1994b) assuming that the distribution of injury victims is similar to that of the population at large in terms of employment. For cases of unknown age and/or gender, the average lost earnings of victims of known age and gender were applied. Paid lost production was also estimated for care-givers of injured children aged under 15 years. Unpaid production losses were also derived in the manner described in Section 3.2.2.2 and applied on the same basis.\n\nThe cost assigned to each setting or activity category was derived on the basis of the proportion of the number of cases in each category. However, where the category definitions coincide with ICD-9 cause groups, the estimates have been taken directly from those groups and adjustments were then made to the remaining groups to arrive at the known totals. For example, self-harm and interpersonal violence exist as categories in both the ICD-9 classification and the activity coding. In the case of transportation activities, the estimates for the ICD-9 cause groups \"motor vehicle traffic\" and \"other transport\" have been added together and a deduction made for the proportion of work-related injuries (known or estimated from WorkCover data) included in these categories.\n\nWhile the original aim of this study was to provide an estimate of the total economic cost of injury to the Victorian community, it became clear, in the process of developing the methodology, that any costing exercise is dependant entirely on the availability and quality of both incidence and cost data. Consequently, this study, as with most costing exercises in this area, can provide only a partial estimate of the total economic cost, due to the limitations of the available data.\n\nThe cost estimates developed in this study utilise the best available data for developing an estimate of the cost of injury to Victoria. However, several qualifications (most of which are discussed in the preceding chapters on methodology), should be highlighted.\n\nThe incidence estimates are likely to be an underestimate, particularly at the less severe level of non-hospitalised injury because current injury surveillance systems do not pick up important areas of primary care, other than Emergency Departments and general practitioners, such as sports medicine clinics, workplace clinics and allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and chiropractors. The number of deaths associated with falls is also known to be an underestimate.\n\nSeveral known costs are excluded because data are unavailable. No attempt was made to value the services of family and friends (beyond the productive loss to care-givers of child injury victims) who care for the injured, because of the lack of data available in relation to this area. However, this 'informal care' cost is likely to be significant as indicated by case studies included in the study by Rice et al (1989).\n\nSimilarly, costs associated with the injury event (such as property damage), rather than the injury itself, have been excluded on conceptual and practical grounds. Conceptually, the focus of the study is the costs generated by the injury itself, rather than the precipitating event. Practically, data relating to such costs is just not available for all types of injury events. It should be noted, however, that these costs can account for a major part of the cost of an injury event. These costs, as indicated by the BTCE reports (1990,1992) can be quite considerable.\n\nThere are no estimates of the long-term treatment costs (beyond the first 3-4 years) associated with the majority of severely injured cases, because there is no data available except for those with spinal cord injury. Severely injured persons may be institutionalised and an attempt has been made to capture this cost in estimating the lifetime cost of nursing home care. However, there is no data available relating to the ongoing costs associated with medical and other treatment.\n\nMorbidity costs associated with non-hospitalised injury are likely to be an underestimate because of the conservative measure used and the fact that some non-hospitalised injury (eg back injury) can result in long-term disability.\n\nNo attempt has been made to capture the cost of pain and suffering (except as it is reflected in the willingness-to-pay estimates provided in Chapter 8).\n\nOverall, it can be assumed that the estimates presented in this study represent the lower limit of the true lifetime cost of injury in Victoria. As better cost data become available and, with the ongoing progress in the quality of injury surveillance data, refinements and improvements to the approach used here can be made. However, the estimates presented here are based on the best data available at the present time.\n\nBecause of the controversy about the relevance of including indirect costs and because the different components fall within different sectors of the economy, this study reports the direct and indirect costs separately, as well as the total amount. The separate components of the direct costs have also been identified as this may help policy makers and other interested parties identify the sectors on which the major burden falls. An attempt has also been made to identify the major sources of payment for the various types of direct cost incurred (see Chapter 7).\n\nBecause the study is incidence-based, the estimates contained herein represent the current care, or 'do nothing' option, and therefore can provide a baseline against which new interventions can be assessed.\n\nFinally, while the primary focus of this study is the economic cost of injury to Victoria, in the process of developing these costs, an extensive description of the epidemiology of injury in Victoria has been produced (see chapter 5). This represents the first comprehensive epidemiology of injury study published for Victoria and provides information about the frequency, rates, causes and severity of injury as well as disaggregations based on age, gender, activity at time of injury and location of injury event. This data provides an important adjunct to the cost data presented in Chapter 6.\n\nIn Victoria in 1993/94, injuries resulted in at least 1,487 deaths (with an estimated further 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injuries sustained in that year), 67,402 persons hospitalised, and an estimated 397,160 non-hospitalised medically treated injured persons in Victoria in 1993/94 (Table 5-1). In total, over 446,000 people were injured or 10.5 persons injured per year for every 100 Victorian residents (the estimated resident population of Victoria by age and sex is shown in Appendix Table B1). Just over one in 10 persons in this State, in a year, sustain an injury that requires at least an attendance at a hospital Emergency Department or a general practitioner's surgery. Many of these injuries are fatal or serious enough to require hospitalisation and are associated with long-term disability.\n\nOf the total 466,049 persons injured in Victoria in 1993/94, almost 30 percent (134,543) occurred in the 25-44 year age-group (who account for 31 percent of the Victorian population). Persons aged 15-24 comprise almost 16 percent of the Victorian population yet account for more than 20 percent (103,704) of all injuries. While children under the age of 15 account for 21 percent of the total Victorian population, they comprise almost 30 percent of the total injured population (about 131,500 injuries). Overall, persons aged under 45 years sustain almost 80 percent of all injuries.\n\nThe risk of injury is higher among males who sustain almost 62 percent of all injuries yet account for only 49.5 percent of the population. Almost 13 percent of Victorian males incur injuries, whereas for females the risk is lower with about 8 percent sustaining an injury in a year. Among both males and females the largest number of injuries occurs in the 25-44 year age-group. The risk of injury is highest, however, for younger males with more than one in five (or 20 percent of) males aged 15-24 sustaining an injury during a single year. Overall, the leading cause of injury death in Victoria is suicide, followed by motor vehicle accidents, whereas falls are the leading cause of hospitalisation and of all non-fatal injury.\n\nMost injuries occur in the home (36 percent) followed by areas of sport and recreation (12.5 percent) then areas of transport (11.7 percent). In terms of activity being undertaken at the time of injury, most injuries were associated with sport and leisure activities (40.2 percent) followed by work-related injury (11 percent) the transportation injuries (10.8 percent).\n\nThe largest number of injuries of each level of severity is among males. Almost three-quarters (72.5%) of injury deaths and over three-fifths (61.5%) of non-fatal injuries occur among males (Table 5-1 and Figure 5-1).\n\nIt should be noted when comparing the number of cases within age groupings that the size of the groups vary. This has been done to reflect the natural groupings that injury prevention researchers, practitioners and policy-makers are interested in, for example : pre-schoolers (0-4 years), children (5-14 years), young adults (15-24 years) and so on. It also reflects the groupings of, and allows for comparison with, the major US cost of injury study by Rice et al. (1989). However, care should be exercised when making comparisons, between age-groupings which contain disparate ranges. These should be based on rates.\n\nAlthough adults aged 25-44 years have the greatest number of injuries overall, they are not overrepresented in the injury data. This age-group represents 31 percent of the total Victorian population and account for a similar percentage of all injuries (29 percent). They account for 29 percent of deaths due to injury, 27 percent of injury hospitalisations and 29 percent of less severely injured, non-hospitalised persons. However, young people aged 15-24 account for approximately 16 percent of the Victorian population yet comprise 22 percent of the total population of injured persons. Young people in this age-group account for 20 percent of both injury fatalities and hospitalisations and 23 percent of non-hospitalised injuries. Children aged 5-14 are also over-represented as injury victims, accounting for 14 percent of the Victorian population yet comprising 19 percent of all injury cases. Children in this age-group, however, tend to have less severe injuries overall accounting for 20 percent of non-hospitalised cases but only 12 percent of hospitalisations and 2 percent of deaths (Figure 5-2). Overall, children in the 0-4 age-group are also slightly over-represented in the injury data accounting for 7 percent of the total population but just over 9 percent of all injuries. Again, this over-representation occurs at the less severe end of the spectrum accounting for almost 10 percent of non-hospitalised injuries, but only 6 percent of hospitalised cases and 2 percent of deaths. The disparities in age-groupings should be taken into account when interpreting Table 5-1 and Figure 5-2.\n\nUnlike other leading causes of death and hospitalisation (such as cancer and heart disease), nearly 80 percent of the injuries resulting in death or hospitalisation occur among persons less than 65 years of age, with nearly two-thirds occurring among persons less than 45 years of age.\n\nThe risk, or rate, of injury presents a slightly different picture (Figures 5-3, 5-4 and 5-5). Although the number of deaths and hospitalisations due to injury for the elderly aged 75 years and above are lower than the number in the three younger age-groups (15-24, 25-44 and 45-64), the risk of both death and hospitalisation as a result of injury is highest for the elderly aged 75 and older (115 and 4,483 per 100,000 Victorian residents for deaths and hospitalisations, respectively). The elderly aged 75 years and over comprise less than 5 percent of the Victorian population yet account for over 14 percent of all injuries resulting in death or hospitalisation. Young people aged 15-24 rank second in the risk of injury severe enough to result in death or hospitalisation (42 and 1,908 per 100,000 respectively). The death rate for injury is lowest among children aged 5-14 years (4.5 per 100,000) while the hospitalisation rate for injury is lowest among adults aged 45-64 years (1,055 per 100,000 population).\n\nPatterns of injury by age are considerably different for less severe injuries not resulting in hospitalisation. The elderly aged 75 and older have a comparatively low risk of non-hospitalised injury (5,593 per 100,000 population). Children aged 5-14, young people aged 15-24 and children aged 0-4 have the highest risk of minor injury (12,916; 12,870 and 12,197 per 100,000 respectively).\n\nThe risk of injury also varies by gender within each level of injury severity. In every age group except the very young (0-4 years) and the elderly (75 years and older), the injury death rate for males is more than twice that of females. In contrast, males are only 1.7 times as likely as females to sustain a non-fatal injury. Among adults aged 65 years and over, females are almost one and a half times as likely as males to suffer a non-fatal injury.\n\nTable 5-1 : Number and rate of injured persons by sex, age, and injury severity, Victoria, 1993/94 Total Fatalities* Hospitalised Non-hospitalised Age & gender Number Rate per 100,000 persons Number Rate per 100,000 persons Number Rate per 100,000 persons Number Rate per 100,000 persons Total 466,049 10,445 1,487 33.33 67,402 1,511 397,160 8,901 0-4 43,451 13,531 26 8.10 4,256 1,325 39,169 12,197 5-14 88,057 14,174 28 4.51 7,786 1,253 80,243 12,916 15-24 103,704 14,820 292 41.73 13,352 1,908 90,060 12,870 25-44 134,543 9,675 443 31.86 18,134 1,304 115,966 8,340 45-64 54,783 6,114 320 35.71 9,457 1,055 45,006 5,022 65-74 17,958 5,633 131 41.09 4,797 1,505 13,030 4,087 75+ 21,853 10,192 247 115.19 9,613 4,483 11,993 5,593 Missing 1,699 7 1,692 Male 286,742 12,973 1,078 48.77 38,839 1,757 246,825 11,167 0-4 24,539 14,898 15 9.11 2,509 1,523 22,015 13,366 5-14 52,353 16,446 19 5.97 4,985 1,566 47,349 14,874 15-24 72,098 20,241 237 66.54 9,528 2,675 62,333 17,500 25-44 91,064 13,160 343 49.57 12,171 1,759 78,550 11,352 45-64 31,818 7,046 249 55.14 5,500 1,218 26,069 5,773 65-74 7,589 5,134 86 58.18 1,873 1,267 5,630 3,808 75+ 6,237 7,829 129 161.94 2,269 2,848 3,839 4,819 Missing 1,043 4 1,039 Female 179,307 7,963 409 18.16 28,563 1,268 150,335 6,676 0-4 18,912 12,091 11 7.03 1,747 1,117 17,154 10,967 5-14 35,704 11,786 9 2.97 2,801 925 32,894 10,858 15-24 31,606 9,199 55 16.01 3,824 1,113 27,727 8,070 25-44 43,480 6,224 100 14.31 5,963 854 37,417 5,356 45-64 22,965 5,166 71 15.97 3,957 890 18,937 4,260 65-74 10,369 6,064 45 26.32 2,924 1,710 7,400 4,328 75+ 15,616 11,588 118 87.56 7,344 5,450 8,154 6,051 Missing 656 3 653\n\n• Excludes an estimated 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94.\n\n• NOTE : Care should be exercised when comparing frequencies within non-equivalent age-groups.\n\nFigure 5-1 : Distribution of injured persons by gender and severity of injury, 1993/94 72.5% 57.6% 62.1% 37.9% 42.4% 27.5% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Non-hospitalisations Hospitalisations Deaths Females Males Figure 5-2: Distribution of injured persons by age and severity of injury, 1993/94 6.3% 9.9% 1.7% 20.3% 11.6% 1.9% 22.8% 19.8% 19.6% 29.3% 26.9% 29.8% 11.4% 14.0% 21.5% 3.3% 7.1% 8.8% 3.0% 14.3% 16.6% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Non-hospitalisations Hospitalisations Deaths 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65-74 75+ Age group (years) rate per 100,000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 frequency male rate female rate male frequency female frequency Figure 5-4 Number of hospitalised injuries and hospitalised injury rates by age-group and gender 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65-74 75+ Age group (years) rate per 100,000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 frequency male rate female rate male frequency female frequency Figure 5-5 Number of non-hospitalised injuries and non-hospitalised injury rates by agegroup and gender 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 18000 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65-74 75+ Age group (years) rate per 100,000 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 frequency male rate female rate male frequency female frequency\n\nThe distribution of injury by cause varies for deaths, hospitalisations and non-hospitalisations as shown in Table 5-2 and Figure 5-6. The numbers and rates for each cause of injury by age and gender are shown in Appendix Tables C5-C17.\n\nThe leading causes of injury death in Victoria are suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents. They account for 527 and 441 deaths respectively (11.8 and 9.9 per 100,000 population respectively). Together these two causes account for 65 percent of all injury deaths. In contrast, the leading cause of non-fatal injury is falls which account for over 23,000 hospitalisations and over 105,000 non-hospitalised injured persons. Hitting, striking or crushing and motor vehicle traffic accidents are the next most likely causes of injury hospitalisation (6,412 and 6,120 cases respectively) while hitting, striking or crushing and cutting and piercing are the next most likely causes of non-hospitalised injury (81,044 and 43,581 cases respectively). Motor vehicle accidents are the fourth leading cause of non-hospitalised injury accounting for 26,584 injured persons. Self-harm or attempted suicide, on the other hand, account for only 1.7 percent of all non-fatal injury. These differences in distribution by cause and injury severity highlight the lethal nature of injuries involving intentional self-harm and motor vehicles. The rank order of cause varies by age representing exposure and life stage factors (Watt, 1995). (see Appendix Tables C2-C4 ).\n\nInjuries categorised as \"Other\" include a variety of causes (see Appendix Table A1 for category definitions). For deaths, other causes include machinery (13), electrocutions (6), firearms (2) and unspecified (17) and represent just 2.5 percent of all injury deaths. Non-fatal injuries resulting from other causes are mainly those related to foreign bodies, machinery, dog bites and other unspecified causes and comprise 20 percent of all hospitalised injury cases. For less severe nonhospitalised injury, additional common causes categorised as \"other\" include animal and insect bites and over-exertion, and comprise 22 percent of non-hospitalised injuries.\n\nTable 5-2: Number and rate of injured persons by cause of injury and injury severity, Victoria, 1993/94.

The remaining 60 percent of injury deaths were due to unintentional causes mainly motor vehicles (49 percent) and falls (21 percent).. However, this is an under-representation of the true death rate from falls (see Section 3.7.1 Deaths).\n\nIntentional injury was the cause of only about 10 percent of all injury hospitalisations. Of these, almost 55 percent were self-inflicted and 40 percent were due to interpersonal violence. Of the remaining 90 percent of unintentional injury hospitalisations, almost 40 percent were due to falls. At the least severe end of the injury spectrum, it is estimated that only about 6 percent of nonhospitalised cases were intentionally caused. Of these, the majority were due to interpersonal violence (79 percent).\n\nIn terms of injury rates, males are 3.5 times more likely to die from intentional injury than females due mainly to the significantly higher rate of suicide deaths among males (18.82 per 100,000 population compared to 4.93 for females). Whereas females are almost 1.5 times more likely than males to be hospitalised for attempted suicide, males are almost 4 times as likely to be hospitalised for interpersonal violence (see Appendix Tables C12 & C13).\n\nTable 5-3: Number and rate of injured persons by intent and severity of injury, Victoria, 1993/94.

Injury cause groups may include a broad spectrum of injury types and distributing costs on the basis of location and type of injury provides a more sensitive measure of cost between cause groups than applying a blanket average to all cases regardless of location and type of injury.\n\nInjuries to the upper or lower extremities account for nearly 32,500 hospital admissions (17,037 and 15,421 respectively, see Table 5-6) or almost half of all hospitalised injuries. Of these, almost 45 percent are due to falls, 7 percent to motor vehicle accidents and 5 percent to other transport accidents (see Appendix Table B1).\n\nIn 1993/94, over 5,800 Victorians survived a head injury serious enough to warrant hospitalisation. Head injury accounts for around 9 percent of all injury hospitalisations. Of these, 75 percent involved intracranial injury (see Table 567). Although the majority of these injuries are relatively minor and will fully recover, about 20 percent of cases considered minor may continue to experience problems such as dizziness, headache and fatigue, which could interfere with a successful return to a normal life. 9 The Victorian Major Trauma Study (Cameron et al, 1995) indicated that over 500 admissions are cases of severe head injury (AIS = 3-5), the long-term consequences of which are multiple and profound. Falls are the leading cause of head injury hospitalisations in Victoria, accounting for over a third of cases (1992) in 1993/94 while motor vehicles accidents account for a further 21 percent (1236 cases). Data from the Victorian Major Trauma Study (Cameron et al, 1995) however, show that motor vehicle accidents are the major cause of serious head injury.\n\nSpinal cord injury, although relatively rare (about 80 incident cases annually in Victoria 10 ), results in catastrophic physical and psychological changes requiring extensive long-term medical treatment, rehabilitation and extended care. Of the injury cases recorded by the Australian Spinal Cord Injury Surveillance System, almost half were due to motor vehicle accidents (46 percent), with falls (including diving into water) accounting for a further 29 percentfoot_4 .\n\nFractures account for over a third of all injury hospitalisations (see Table 5-7), the majority of which are caused by falls (61 percent), then motor vehicle accidents (11 percent) or being hit, struck or crushed by an object or person (9 percent) (see Appendix Table B2). Just under 5 percent of all fractures were intentionally inflicted.\n\nBruising, haematomas and/or crushing injuries account for 9 percent of all injury hospitalisations while poisoning accounts for another 8.3 percent. Of the poisonings, over half were self-inflicted.\n\n9 Kath Howlett (Burgess & Howlett Consulting) cited in \"What is the extent of ABI in the community?\" Headway News, April/May, 1997.

An estimate of the incidence of injury that occurs in different settings and during different activities is provided here in an attempt to identify areas of concern that may have been concealed by the ICD-9 disaggregation.\n\nMost injuries occur in the home with 35 percent of all injuries being sustained in a private residential setting (Table 56). Injuries that occur in areas of transport are the next most prevalent at 12 percent. Private homes and areas of transport are the most likely setting for injuries of all severities. Together they account for 77 percent of all injury deaths (with 42 percent occurring in the home and 35 percent in transport settings), 58 percent of all hospitalised injuries (43 and 15 percent respectively) and 46 percent of non-hospitalised injuries (35 and 11 percent respectively).\n\nAreas of sport and recreation together account for 12.5 percent of all injuries (9 percent of deaths, 8 percent of hospitalisations and 13 percent of non-hospitalised injury cases).\n\nThe educational setting is the next most likely place for injury to occur (8 percent of all injuries). However, injuries in this setting tend to be less severe (accounting for 9 percent of all nonhospitalised cases , 4 percent of hospitalisations and only 0.3 percent of injury deaths).\n\nIt should be noted that injury setting does not always equate with activity being undertaken at the time of injury (see Table 567). For example, four deaths occurred in areas of sport. However, only one of these was actually involved in a sporting activity at the time of injury. One fell from a ladder and the remaining two were suicides (State Coroner's Office, 1996, Table CRN 2.6). Similarly, while injuries occurring in an educational setting amount to 8.3 percent of all injuries only 0.6 percent of cases were actually involved in an educational activity at the time of injury. Most injuries occur in the playground during recreational breaks. Of the injury deaths recorded in an educational setting, 2 involved drug overdoses and 3 were suicides.\n\nLeisure activities accounted for a third of all injuries (154,078 cases) followed by paid work activities (51,085 cases or 11 percent of the total) and transportation injuries (50,538 or 9.5 percent of all injuries).\n\nIn terms of injury severity, self-harm and transportation injuries account for the greatest number of fatalities (35.4 and 30.8 percent respectively of all deaths). Sports and leisure activities account for the greatest number of injury hospitalisations (32.8 percent) followed by transportation (13.5 percent) and work injuries (10.2 percent). Sports and leisure, work and transportation are the most common sources of non-hospitalised injuries (41.5, 11.1 and 10.3 percent respectively).\n\nIt should be noted that the large percentage of cases in which injury setting or activity at the time of injury was not specified, missing or invalid in the hospitalised and non-hospitalised data means that the numbers estimated here for each category are likely to be underestimates except where data classified by injury cause could be translated directly to activity (eg transportation, self-harm and interpersonal violence).\n\nTable 5-6: Number and percentage of injured persons by setting of injury event and injury severity, Victoria, 1993/94.

The number of hospitalised cases is known to be an underestimate given that there were an additional 5,554 self-insurer claims reported in 1993/94 (Victorian WorkCover Authority, 1994). However, because no data was available on the severity of these cases (hospitalised or non-hospitalised) they have not been allocated here. It should also be noted that self-employed persons (such as farmers) are not covered under WorkCover.\n\nHaving established the incidence by major age, sex and cause categories, an estimate of the economic cost of injury can be developed by applying relevant costs to incidence data. Estimates of the lifetime cost of injury presented in this report consist of three components : a) direct treatment and related costs; b) morbidity costs and c) mortality costs. Costs are presented by gender, age and cause as well as for three mutually exclusive groups that broadly reflect the severity of injury : (1) injury resulting in death, (2) injury resulting in hospitalisation with survival to discharge, and (3) injury requiring medical attention without hospitalisation 12 . Supplementary estimates for categories of injury concealed by the ICD-9 cause disaggregation are also presented by setting and activity at the time of injury.\n\nEstimates of economic cost reported here are for the financial year 1993/94, the most recent year for which reliable incidence data for each level of injury severity were available. The incidence and lifetime cost estimates for injury in Victoria presented in this report are conservative estimates based on currently available data and commonly used methodologies. This study utilised information from various sources, but in some cases estimates are necessarily made on the basis of limited data and the assumptions, caveats, etc. have been clearly indicated in the text. However, the estimates developed in this study represent the lower boundary of the true cost of injury, but the best estimates based on currently available data.\n\nThe total lifetime cost of injury for the 466,200 persons who sought medical treatment for injury in Victoria in 1993/94, is estimated at $2,582.9 million, or an average of $5,541 per injured person. Direct expenditure for treatment of injury including hospital, medical, pharmaceuticals, rehabilitation, attendant and nursing home care and other services amount to almost $759 million or $1,628 per injured person. (Note that average costs are skewed towards the cost of nonhospitalised injury due to the large number of cases in this category).\n\nDisability from injury results in loss of output with individuals generally, unable to attend to their normal activities (eg domestic duties), and members of the labour force, unable to work. In total more than 59,000 life-years (to age 75) are lost (46.5 days per injured person) as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94, valued at $1,010.5 million. The morbidity cost amounts to an average of $2,175 per injured person.\n\nOther losses result from premature injury fatalities. At least 1,487 premature deaths from injury occurred in 1993/94 with an estimated additional 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injury sustained in 1993/94. Premature death is extremely costly, amounting to an estimated annual loss of 48,773 life years (to age 75), or 30 years per death. The mortality cost amounts to $813.5 million at a 7 percent discount rate, or an average cost of $499,378 per death.\n\nIn addition to the reduction in these injured person-based costs, effective injury prevention measures would also provide savings in non-person based costs of injury events such as property damage, fire, police and judicial services, etc.\n\n12 As mentioned previously, injuries for which attention was not sought from either a hospital Emergency Department or a general practitioner have been excluded from this study since there is no data available on the frequency of such cases.\n\nmortality, 8 percent. The high direct cost for the injured elderly (compared to other cost components) reflects the fact that trauma is often associated with complications and comorbidities in the elderly requiring longer stays in hospital and often long-term admissions to nursing homes.\n\nIn contrast, for injured persons aged 15-24, direct costs comprise only 21 percent of total lifetime cost while morbidity and mortality costs represent 43 and 36 percent respectively. The high indirect cost for this age-group reflects their high injury fatality rate, the large number of productive years lost, high labour force participation and high potential lifetime earnings lost.\n\nThe distribution of total lifetime cost by cause shows that the greatest losses are caused by motor vehicles traffic accidents and falls, accounting for $570.5 million and $557.2 million respectively (Table 6-2). Although the injury rate for falls is higher than for motor vehicle accidents, the significantly higher number of motor vehicle fatalities among young people results in higher lifetime costs. Motor vehicle traffic injuries account for 7 percent of total injuries and 22 percent of total economic costs whereas falls account for almost 28 percent of injuries and 21.5 percent of total lifetime costs (Figure 6-4).\n\nSelf-inflicted injury ranks third in economic cost, amounting to $428.4 million, or 16.5 percent of the total cost. Although self-inflicted injury account for only 1.8 percent of all injuries, fatalities at young ages are high (the suicide rate is highest in the 15-24 year-old age-group), resulting in high costs.\n\nInjuries due to other causes number over 99,000, 21 percent of all injuries, and the total lifetime costs amount to $318.8 million or 12 percent of the total cost of injury. Included in this category is a variety of injuries including accidental firearm injuries, exposure, foreign bodies and dog bite. For a list of causes of injury included in the 'other' category, see Appendix A.\n\nDistribution by cause of injury varies among the three cost components (ie direct, morbidity and mortality costs), reflecting differing age, gender, medical treatment usage, morbidity and mortality patterns. Figure 6-5 shows the distribution of each cost component by cause of injury.\n\nAs expected, the mortality cost for injuries with high fatality rates represents a higher proportion of the total than do direct and morbidity costs. For example, 95 percent of the total economic cost of drowning and near drowning is lost lifetime productivity resulting from deaths reflecting the fact that 30 percent of drowning deaths are aged under 5 years (see Appendix Table C7). For falls, which often require lengthy hospitalisation and can result in long-term disability, the direct cost of treatment and the morbidity costs comprise the bulk of the total costs -47 percent and 48.5 percent respectively. The low mortality cost reflects the fact that the majority of deaths (78 percent) occur in the 75+ years age-group (see Appendix Table C9).\n\nLifetime costs per person varies for the different causes. Drowning and near-drowning are the highest, amounting to almost $62,000 per injured person followed by suicide and self-inflicted injury, at $51,500 per injured person (Table 6-2). The high cost per person is due to the fact that these causes often result in death (rather than hospitalisation or non-hospitalisation), and the victims tend to be young so mortality costs predominate.\n\nTable 6-3 presents the total lifetime cost of injury by cause, age and gender. For most causes of injury, the 25-44 year age-group has the highest total costs followed by the 15-24 year age-group. The exceptions are : motor vehicle traffic injuries where the 15-24 year age-group has the highest costs, falls where the 65-74 year age-group is the most costly and asphyxia where the 45-64 year age-group has the highest total costs. While total costs reflect differing age, gender, medical treatment usage, morbidity and mortality patterns within the cause group, it should be noted that part of the higher cost of the 25-44 year age-group can be attributed to the fact that it represents a larger age-grouping. The cost per injured person by cause, age and sex shown in Table 6-4 presents a different picture.\n\nBecause drowning is almost always fatal, the total cost per person is very high. The cost per person drowned is highest for females aged 15-24 at around $203,000 followed by males aged 25-44 at $178,500. The total cost per person injured through self-harm/suicide ranks second and the highest cost is for males aged 45-64 years, at almost $103,000 followed by males aged 15-24 years at almost $81,000. Motor vehicle traffic injuries rank third in total cost per injured person, estimated at around $17,000 with the highest cost for persons aged 25-44 years.\n\nFor most causes of injury the average cost per person is higher for males than females. The most notable exception is for drowning and near-drowning. Females have slightly higher average costs than males for injuries caused by poisoning, falls and interpersonal violence.\n\nWhile intentional injury only accounts for 6.5 percent of all injury cases, it is responsible for about 22 percent of the total cost of injury. Over three-quarters of this cost (76 percent) is due to suicide or self-harm.\n\nThe major part of the total cost of suicide is due to mortality costs reflecting the high fatality rate and the young age-groups of the victims (see Tables 6-2, 6-3 and Figure 6-5). The mortality cost for male suicide deaths is over 3 times that of females reflecting the variation in the death rate from suicide between males and females . The morbidity costs of self-inflicted injury are greater for females (1.7 times that of males) reflecting the fact that females are more likely to be hospitalised for attempted suicide than males. On the other hand, the morbidity costs for males as a result of interpersonal violence are over three times that of females (see Table 6-3).\n\nTable 6-1: Lifetime Cost of Injury by Age, Gender and Type of Cost, 1993/94.

The latter group, although large, involves the least severe injuries with relatively low costs. It is expected that the incidence of injury at this level of severity is under-estimated due to the nature of current injury surveillance systems. The VEMD and ELVIS collections identify injury cases which present to a hospital Emergency department or a general practitioner. Cases whose sole treatment is from an allied health professional such as a physiotherapist, chiropractor or osteopath or who present to a specialist sports or workplace clinic are not included in these estimates.\n\nOf the estimated $2,583 million lifetime cost, $824.7 million or 32 percent is the cost of fatalities.\n\nIncluded is a relatively small amount of direct costs, the majority of the total cost being the mortality costs associated with premature death. More than half of the total lifetime cost is for injuries involving hospitalisation ($1,389 million or 54 percent) with less than 15 percent (or $369 million) for nonhospitalised injury cases (Table 6-5 and 6-6).\n\nThe cost per injured person for each level of injury also reflects severity. The cost per fatality is $506,267, which consists mainly of the present value of foregone earnings (paid and unpaid productivity).\n\nThe cost per hospitalised injury is $20,607, substantially greater than the $929 per non-hospitalised case.\n\nThe distribution of lifetime costs by severity of injury varies by gender and age. Table 6-5 shows the total lifetime cost of injury by age, gender and level of severity.\n\nOf the total 1,629 injury fatalities occurring as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94, 72.5 percent were males and 27.5 percent were females. This is reflected in the lifetime costs for injury fatalities where males account for $276.5 million or 74 percent of the total ($824.7 million). Of the 67,402 hospitalised injured persons, 38,839 or 58 percent were males who accounted for 57 percent ($798.3 million) of the total lifetime costs ($1,389.1 million). Males also incur more minor injuries than females, accounting for 62 percent of non-hospitalised injuries and they incur about the same proportion (61 percent or $225 million) of the $369.2 million cost of non-hospitalised injury.\n\nOf the 1,629 deaths resulting from injury in 1993/94, 29 percent were in the 25-44 year age-group. The total lifetime cost for this group ($363.5 million) comprises 44 percent of the total cost of fatalities.\n\nYoung adults aged 15-24 accounted for around 20 percent of all fatalities and 31 percent of the total cost of fatalities. Deaths in this age-group incur the highest average cost at $819,046 per death. People who die prematurely in this age-group are at the peak of their productivity and the present value of future earnings lost is significant. By contrast, almost 27 percent of injury fatalities are persons aged over 65 years but they account for only 3 percent ($27.4 million) of the lifetime cost of fatalities with an average cost per death of $63,965. It should be noted that the death rate from injury shows a different picture.\n\nThe rate of fatalities per 100,000 persons is highest for the 75 + age-group (115), followed by the 15-24 year-olds (42), the 65-74 year olds (41), the 45-64 year olds (36) and then the 25-44 year olds (32) (see Table 5-1).\n\nInjured persons aged 25-44 years account for 27 percent of all injury hospitalisations and 29 percent of non-hospitalised injury cases and comprise 32 percent and 42 percent of the total lifetime cost respectively. Young adults aged 15-24 year account for 20 percent of injury hospitalisations and 23 percent of non-hospitalised cases and comprise 23 percent and 35 percent of the total lifetime cost respectively. Of the hospitalised cases, persons aged 65-74 years had the highest average lifetime costs at $28,867 possibly reflecting the large number of falls in this age-group resulting in often lengthy hospitalisations, recuperation periods and/or nursing home stays. Young adults aged 15-24 years have the second highest cost per hospitalised injury at $24,396 per person. Persons in this age-group also have the highest average cost per non-hospitalised injury at $1,440.\n\nAgain the injury rates for less severe injury show a different picture to the costs. The rates for hospitalised injury are highest for the elderly over 75 years (4,485 per 100,000), followed by 15-24 year olds (1,908 per 100,000) then the 65-74 year olds (1,505 per 100,000). The non-hospitalised injury rate is highest for 5-14 year olds (12,916 per 100,000) followed by 15-24 year olds (12,870 per 1000,000) then 0-4 year olds (12,197 per 100,000) (see Table 5-1).\n\nTable 6-6 shows total cost and cost per injured person by cause and level of injury severity. For fatalities, suicide ranks highest, totalling almost $329 million, followed by motor vehicle traffic deaths at $293 million. The lowest ranking cost is for asphyxia at $12 million. On the basis of cost per fatality, cutting/piercing and poisoning rank highest at $765,903 and $629,970 respectively. The least costly fatalities are those from falls, estimated at $105,994. Over 80 percent of deaths from falls occur in persons aged 65 years and older. Their labour force participation rate and earnings are low and life expectancy short, resulting in a lower cost per fatality.\n\nFalls account for the greatest cost of hospitalised injuries ($456 million), followed by 'other' injuries ($249 million) and motor vehicle traffic injuries ($199 million). The cost per hospitalised person ranges from $9,199 for near-drownings to $35,164 for fire, flame and burn injuries. The second and third most costly hospitalised injuries are motor vehicle traffic injuries and attempted suicide at $32,544 and $23,863 respectively. As expected the cost per non-hospitalised injury is the lowest ranging from $317 for neardrowning to $2,956 for motor vehicle traffic injuries.\n\nAn estimate of the incidence of injury that occurs in different settings and during different activities is provided here in an attempt to identify areas of concern that may have been concealed by the ICD-9 disaggregation by cause. Caution should be exercised if comparing the estimates presented here with the cause groups because both the incidence of injury and the costs (although based on the same data) have been derived in a different way (see Section 4.8.6 for details of methodology and Section 5.6 for incidence data).\n\nWhen considering setting (Table 67), injuries that occur in private homes account for the greatest proportion of the lifetime cost of injury ($985.5 million), followed by areas of transportation ($708.7 million) then areas of sport and recreation ($212.5 million).\n\nIn terms of activity being undertaken (Table 678), injuries associated with transportation are the most costly at $651.3 million, followed by sport and recreation injuries ($556.2 million), intentional self-harm ($428.4 million) then work-related injuries ($187.8 million). The lifetime cost estimate for work-related injury for 1993-94 is an underestimate of the real cost, given that WorkCover alone paid out a total of $245.645 million in direct treatment costs, income support and lump sum compensation payments to December 31, 1996 (see Chapter 7). This underestimation is probably due to the likely underestimation of long-term costs (direct and morbidity) and of non-hospitalised morbidity costs in this study.\n\nTable 6-5: Total Lifetime Cost of Injury by Age, Gender and Level of Injury Severity, 1993/94 Cost (millions) Cost per Injured Person Age & gender Total Fatalities Hospitalised Non-Hospitalised Total Fatalities Hospitalised Non-Hospitalised Total Table 6-6: Total Lifetime Cost of Injury by Cause and Level of Injury Severity, Victoria, 1993/94 Cost (millions) Cost per Injured Person Cause & gender Total Fatalities* Hospitalised Nonhospitalised Total Fatalities* Hospitalised Nonhospitalised Table 6-7 Total lifetime cost of injury, setting of injury event by injury severity, Victoria, 1993/94.

They include costs such as hospital (inpatient & Emergency Dept. -private and public), medical (general & specialist services), rehabilitation services and nursing home accommodation costs associated with the treatment of injury. Other direct costs include ambulance transport, pharmaceuticals and treatment by health professionals other than medical practitioners and other expenses such as aids and appliances for injured persons. They may also include the cost of caring for an injured person at home such as attendant care or professional home nursing. Non-medical direct costs related to injuries include amounts spent on home modification and road rescue costs in the case of motor vehicle accidents. Since this report focuses on the cost of injury, non-medical costs are limited to those related to the injured person and exclude the costs associated with the damage caused by the event that resulted in the injury.\n\nTotal direct personal medical and non-medical costs of care for persons injured in 1993/94 are estimated at almost $759 million or $1,629 per injured person (Table 6-2). It should be noted that average costs are skewed towards the cost of less severe non-hospitalised injuries since they account for the majority of cases (the average direct cost for a fatality being $6,890; a hospitalisation, $9,591; and a non-hospitalised case, $255). Although hospitalised injuries account for only about 15 percent of all injured persons, they consume the greatest proportion (85 percent) of spending on injury treatment.\n\nUnintentional injury accounts for 90 percent of the direct treatment and related costs ($688.3 million). Of the single causes, falls account for the greatest percentage (36 percent or $270.3 million) followed by motor vehicle traffic accidents (16 percent or $125.7 million) (Table 6789).\n\nHospital costs account for 38 percent of the total ($290 million), followed by medical costs (27 percent or $205.1 million) then allied health professionals (13 percent or $99.3 million) (Table 6-10).\n\nTable 6-9 Estimated total lifetime direct cost of treatment, injury cause by level of severity, Victoria, 1993/94 LEVEL OF SEVERITY CAUSE TOTAL $ FATALITIES $ HOSPITALISED $ NON-HOSPITALISED $ TOTAL 758,970,747 11,223,271 646,439,566 101,307,910 UNINTENTIONAL 688,338,843 7,261,792 587,074,833 94,002,218 Motor vehicle traffic 125,685,535 3,291,970 106,586,362 15,807,203 Other transport 32,234,768 301,266 28,612,331 3,321,171 Drowning/neardrowning 903,922 261,842 595,673 46,407 Poisoning 26,460,925 489,777 23,272,714 2,698,434 Falls 270,322,344 2,147,785 241,566,010 26,608,549 Fire/ flames/ burns 24,169,196 235,170 22,102,737 1,831,289 Hit/ struck/ crush 61,185,488 98,351 43,637,803 17,449,334 Cutting/ piercing 30,179,427 17,034 20,515,183 9,647,210 Asphyxia 2,300,530 139,902 1,967,601 193,027 Other 114,896,708 278,695 98,218,419 16,399,594 INTENTIONAL 70,631,904 3,961,479 59,364,733 7,305,692 Suicide/self-harm 40,400,122 3,512,349 35,473,411 1,414,362 IPV 26,776,345 378,486 20,841,781 5,556,078 Unknown intent 3,455,437 70,644 3,049,541 335,252\n\nTable 6-10 Estimated lifetime direct cost of treatment, type of expenditure by level of severity, Victoria, 1993/94.

To the degree that injuries prevent or reduce an individual's capacity to produce goods and services in the marketplace, the public sector, or the household, the value of these losses is borne by society. Estimates of morbidity cost involve applying earnings to work time lost and imputing a dollar value to housekeeping services for those unable to perform them. Lifetime morbidity costs include not only the short-term losses associated with hospitalisation and convalescence but also the value of output lost in the long-term by persons disabled as a result of injury that occurred in 1993/94.\n\nLifetime morbidity losses for persons injured in 1993/94 amount to 59,216 years or an average of 47 days per injured person. These losses equate to an estimated total morbidity cost of $1,010.5 million, or $2,175 per injured person. Persons aged 25-44 years account for 28 percent of all non-fatal injuries yet comprise 39 percent of total morbidity costs. Similarly, the 15-24 year group account for 22 percent of non-fatal injuries and 30 percent of morbidity costs. These two groups together account for 88 percent of hospitalised and non-hospitalised injury cases of working age (15-64 years) and therefore result in the majority of employment and housekeeping losses. The morbidity cost for the 25-44 year age-group amounts to $396 million, or $2,953 per injured person. For persons aged 15-24 morbidity totals almost $306 million, or $2,958 per injured person (Table 67891011). Again, it should be noted that the injury rate for the 15-24 year old age-group is 1.5 times that of the 25-44 year old group (see Table 5-1).\n\nThe morbidity cost for males is higher than that for females, $594.5 million compared to $416 million reflecting the higher number of non-fatal injuries among males. On the basis of cost per injured person, the morbidity cost for females is higher than that for males ($2,326 compared to $2,081). This may reflect the significantly higher morbidity for females in the 65-74 year age-group in which there is a high number of falls. The average morbidity cost for this age-group is $7,181 for females compared to $1,987 for males. Life years lost for injured males amounts to 38,856 compared to 20,361 for females reflecting the higher number of injuries among males. The number of days lost per injured person is 50 days for males compared to 42 for females.\n\nTable 6-12 shows the morbidity losses by cause of injury. Morbidity losses from falls ranks highest, amounting to $263 million, reflecting the large number of falls resulting in disability. 'Other' causes rank second in total morbidity cost at almost $189 million. Motor vehicle traffic injuries rank third with total morbidity losses of $155 million. Per person costs are highest for self-harm ($8,079) and motor vehicle traffic accidents ($4,751) reflecting the high proportion of younger age-groups affected in each case.\n\nTable 6-11: Injury Morbidity Losses by Age and Gender, Victoria, 1993/94.

Applying estimates of the value of future production by age and gender to deaths resulting from injuries sustained in 1993/94, yields an estimated loss to the Victorian economy of $813.5 million, or an average of $499,378 per death (see Table 678910111213).\n\nFor the 1,173 males who died from injuries, an estimated 37,872 life years were lost (to age 75) or 32 years per death, valued at $604 million or $514,961 per death. There is not a great deal of variation between these measures in that males represent 72 percent of all deaths, 78 percent of life years lost and 74 percent of total mortality costs (Figure 6-6).\n\nThe 456 females who died represent 10,901 life years lost or an average of 24 years per death. The estimated total production loss (paid and unpaid) for female deaths was $209.4 million or $459,291 per death. The difference in mortality costs between males and females is not as pronounced as in some studies (eg. Rice et al., 1990, where males represent 72 percent of deaths and life years lost yet account for 82 percent of mortality costs) because the values of future production used here assume equal value per hour for paid and unpaid work (BTCE, 1992).\n\nThe number of injury deaths, life years lost and the mortality costs vary with age. Most victims are relatively young compared with other causes of death -over half (52 percent) are aged under 45 years. These deaths account for 83 percent of life-years lost (to age 75) to injury and represent 79 percent of total mortality costs.\n\nAlmost 30 percent of all injury deaths occur in the 25-44 year age-group (31 percent of the Victorian population). However, the number of life years lost in this age-group, a function of both age and number of deaths, represent 40 percent of all life years lost to injury. In terms of lost production, this group accounts for 44 percent of the total. However, the 15-24 year-old age-group have the highest mortality cost per death at $813,286. This reflects the high number of deaths, and the comparatively young age of the fatalities, in this group.\n\nIn contrast, 48 percent of injury deaths occur in those aged over 45 years. These account for only 17 percent of life years lost to age 75, and 21 percent of productivity loss (see Figure 67).\n\nMortality losses by cause of injury are summarised in Table 6-14 and Figure 6-8. Suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents are the most devastating in terms of number of deaths. Together they account for 64 percent of all deaths from injuries sustained in 1993/94, 75 percent of life years lost and 76 percent of mortality costs. This reflects the fact that the majority (62 percent) of these injury deaths occur to people under the age of 45 years. Of these, 76 percent are male.\n\nSuicide alone accounts for one third of all injury deaths, 38 percent of lost life years and 40 percent of productivity losses. The average mortality cost per death is $597,906, the typical victim being a young male. In contrast, the lifetime productivity loss per death for falls, where the typical victim is an elderly person with low earnings and short life expectancy, is only $97,119. Drowning has the highest number of years lost per death (46) because of the high proportion of victims aged under 5 years (30 percent) while the average number of life years lost (to age 75) for a fall death is only 5 years because of the very high proportion of elderly victims.\n\nTable 6-13: Injury Mortality Losses by Age and Gender, 1993/94 Fatalities * Life Years Lost (to age 75) Mortality Cost Estimate Age & gender Number Total Per death Total (millions) Per death Total 1,629 48,773 30 $813.486 $499,378 0-4 27 1,974 73 $8.410 $311,526 5-14 29 1,885 65 $15.772 $543,852 15-24 317 17,281 54 $257.812 $813,286 25-44 475 19,445 41 $360.796 $759,569 45-64 346 7,396 21 $147.013 $424,893 65-74 140 792 6 $23.683 $168,165 75+ 295 0 0 $0 $0 Male 1,173 37,872 32 $604.049 $514,961 0-4 16 1,162 73 $4.811 $300,741 5-14 20 1,302 65 $10.181 $509,027 15-24 256 13,970 55 $202.774 $792,083 25-44 369 15,188 41 $273.389 $740,891 45-64 269 5,451 20 $101.449 $377,132 65-74 91 529 6 $11.447 $125,786 75+ 152 0 0 $0 $0 Female 456 10,901 24 $209.437 $459,291 0-4 11 812 74 $3.599 $327,213 5-14 9 583 65 $5.591 $621,241 15-24 61 3,312 54 $55.039 $902,268 25-44 106 4,257 40 $87.407 $824,591 45-64 77 1,674 22 $45.564 $591,749 65-74 49 263 5 $12.237 $249,724 75+ 143 0 0 $0 $0 * Includes an estimated 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94.

Table 7.1 presents the estimated expenditure on direct treatment costs related to injury sustained in 1993/94 up to December 31, 1996 paid for by the TAC, WorkCover and with the balance attributed to 'other sources'. This period accounts for the major part of direct costs since the majority of cases will have recovered with little or no residual disability requiring further treatment (almost 85 percent of hospitalised and 95 percent of nonhospitalised WorkCover cases had been closed at December 31, 1996). This period accounts for 93 percent of the estimated total direct lifetime costs. This is in accord with the study by Rice et al (1989) which suggests that almost 87 percent of direct lifetime treatment costs is incurred in the first year after injury.\n\nTable 7-1 Direct cost of injuries sustained in 1993/94 (to 31/12/96), type of expenditure by source of payment (TAC, WorkCover & other), Victoria.

While the TAC was responsible for $94.064 million or 13 percent of the total direct cost of all injury, it is estimated that the TAC pays for approximately 75 percent of the direct treatment costs of motor vehicle traffic accidents.\n\nWorkCover was responsible for $68.044 million or 9.5 percent of the total direct cost of all injuries sustained in 1993/94. The actual direct treatment cost of work-related injuries is known to be much higher than this since the WorkCover scheme does not cover all workers (in particular, self-employed persons and Commonwealth employees\n\n). And, although WorkCover compensates the majority of more severe, hospitalised cases, only about 40 percent of non-hospitalised work injuries (17,661 cases of an estimated 44,187) are paid through the WorkCover scheme (as distinct from individual employers) 13 . It should also be noted that during the same period the TAC and WorkCover paid out a further $247.076 million in income support and lump sum compensation payments to persons injured in 1993/94. This consisted of $137.096 million in income support ($41.424 million and $95.672 14 million respectively) and $109.98 million in lump sum or common law compensation ($24.051 million and $81.929 million respectively). Self-insurers paid out a further $5.407 million in income support and $9.953 million in lump sum and common law compensation payments for work-related injury in 1993/94.\n\nTable 7-2 presents a more detailed breakdown of the sources of payment by type of expenditure for the estimated direct cost of injury sustained in 1993/94 to December 31, 1996. Apart from the TAC and WorkCover figures (presented as a combined total in the 'Compensation systems' column), which are based on the actual payments to 31/12/96, the payments attributed to the various sectors are based on the proportion of the total health services expenditure for the whole of Australiafoot_7 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 1997, Table 16) adjusted for the greater contribution of the compensation sector for injury-related costs. As such, the distribution of costs between the various sectors presented here should be considered indicative only.\n\n13\n\nIt is estimated that self-insured employers paid out a further $6.269 million for treatment of work-related injury in 1993/94 alone (figures derived from Appendix 3, Victorian WorkCover Authority, 1994).\n\n14\n\nThis figure includes $0.555 million in return-to-work wage support payments by WorkCover. Income support figures quoted here include taxation payments except for a small number of workers compensation recipients who are paid directly from WorkCover rather than via their employer.\n\nEconomists have relied mainly on the human capital approach for valuing the indirect cost, or foregone productivity, as a result of premature death or extended disability. This approach is based on an individual's potential lifetime earnings, discounted back to the year the injury was sustained, as a surrogate measure of his or her future productive worth if the injury had not occurred. This would be entirely appropriate if individuals were considered simply as productive entities. However, societies value the very young and the elderly, as well as the middle-aged, suggesting that attributes other than an individual's level of production are important to human values.\n\nThe willingness-to-pay approach better reflects the value placed on health and life by individuals, and is considered by many economists to be a more appropriate measure, at least from a theoretical viewpoint. This approach measures the total societal value of human life based on the amount individuals or their families are willing to pay for a change that reduces the probability of injury, illness or death (Schelling, 1968). It incorporates all aspects of well-being, including labour and non-labour income, and the value of leisure, pain and suffering. The main objection to the willingness-to-pay method has been that it requires substantial development prior to implementation, which has limited efforts to apply it (Rice et al, 1989).\n\nSince the willingness-to-pay approach to valuing indirect cost is becoming more common, estimates of this cost in relation to injury in Victoria are provided here for reference purposes. Little work has been done in Australia to develop appropriate estimates. Consequently, the figures presented here have been derived from estimates established in overseas studies. In the first case, estimates of what people are willing to pay to avoid death, serious (hospitalised) and minor injury in New Zealand were adjusted (using international exchange rates and CPI adjustments) from those established by Jagadish Guria and associates (1993) at the New Zealand Land Transport Safety Authority (see Table 8-1). When applied to the incidence of injury in Victoria, it is estimated that Victorians may be willing to pay almost $2.45 billion a year (see Table 8-2) to prevent all injury deaths and $10.5 billion to prevent all non-fatal injuries, a total of $12.95 billion annually.\n\nIn comparison, willingness-to-pay figures derived from work by Miller (BTCE, 1994) in the United States, yields an estimate of $5.7 billion annually to prevent all injury deaths in Victoria and almost $21.6 billion to prevent all non-fatal injuries, a total of $27.3 billion.\n\nTable 8-1 : Adjusted person costs -willingness-to-pay Level of injury Willingness-to-pay estimates (adjusted to 1993 $A) Guria (1993) Miller, (BTCE 1994) Killed $1,503,860 $3,499,000 Hospitalised $120,310 $147,440 Medical treatment only $6,015 $29,290\n\nTable 8-2: Total indirect cost estimates -willingness-to-pay Level of injury Willingness-to-pay estimates (1993 $A billion) Guria (1993) Miller (BTCE 1994) Killed $2.450 $5.700 Hospitalised $8.109 $9.938 Medical treatment only $2.389 $11.634 TOTAL $12.948 $27.272\n\nIt is clear that the human capital approach yields significantly lower estimated values of human life than does the willingness-to-pay method. Economic losses to society may be approximated by lost productivity. However, the discounted future earnings figure arrived at by the human capital approach generally underestimates the total perceived loss to the individual. Human capital estimates represent the absolute lower boundary of willingness-to-pay estimates, but may only be within a factor of 2 or 3 (perhaps even 5 or 10) of what a person or his/her family feel they actually lose if death or permanent disablement occur as a result of injury (Hartunian, Smart & Thompson, 1975). Both sets of estimates are presented in this report to provide the reader with the best estimates available using each approach.\n\nOverall, it is estimated that a total of 107,989 life-years (to age-75) were lost as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94. Of these, 45 percent were lost as a result of premature death (mortality) with the remaining 55 percent lost as a result of hospitalisation, recuperation and disability due to injury (morbidity) (see Table 8-3).\n\nMales accounted for the greater proportion of total life-years lost (71 percent), more than 2.5 times that of females. In terms of life-years lost due to premature death (mortality), males accounted for almost 3.5 times that of females. Males also accounted for almost twice as many life-years lost as a result of morbidity due to injury.\n\nOverall, motor vehicle traffic accidents account for the greatest number of potential life-years lost (26, 795) followed by suicide/self-harm (21,740) and falls (15,917). Suicide/self-harm accounts for the greatest number of life-years lost due to premature death (18,509) because of the high number of deaths and the relatively young age of victims. Falls account for the greatest number of life-years lost to disability (14,605) due to the large number of cases and the high proportion of elderly victims who often require lengthy hospitalisation and recuperation.\n\nThe estimated value of foregone quality of life can be described by a measure of health status such as the \"quality adjusted life year, or QALY. QALYs (and variants such as the World Health Organisation and World Bank's \"disability adjusted life years - Murray, 1994;Murray & Lopez, 1994) are scales that value a year in any given health state between death (with value 0) and perfect health (with value 1), based on a representative individual's preferences among different health states. QALYs reflect not only years of life saved but also the degree of functioning and health during those years. A dollar value can be placed on these measures for the purpose of cost benefit analysis (Miller & Levy, 1997).\n\nTable 8-3 Potential life-years lost by severity of injury, age and gender, Victoria, 1993/94.

This study utilised information from various sources, but in some cases estimates are necessarily made on the basis of limited data and the assumptions, caveats, etc. have been clearly indicated in the text. However, the estimates developed in this study are the best estimates based on currently available data.\n\nIt is clear from the results of this study that injuries have a significant impact on the Victorian community, health care system and economy in general. The impact of disability due to injury on the individual and his/her family can be personally and economically devastating. The cost of injury is also a significant burden to the community with the lifetime cost for persons injured in a single year (1993/94) totalling $2,583 million. Direct treatment and related costs alone account for at least $759 million with indirect costs (mortality and morbidity) accounting for a further $1,824 million and almost 108,000 life-years (to age 75). All sectors of the Victorian economy share this burden, including federal, state and local governments, the private sector and individuals.\n\nLifetime direct or treatment costs are considerable at $759 million. This figure is not incompatible with estimates by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for Australia in 1993/94 (Mathers, Penm, Carter & Stevenson, 1997). This study estimated the direct cost of health services by taking known recurrent expenditures on health services and apportioning them to disease categories (on the basis of the ICD-9 CM chapters) using data on utilisation of health services by disease type and costs per service. It estimated that the total treatment cost of injury and poisoning 16 for Australia in 1993/94 was $2,571 million. If we assume that one-quarter of those costs were incurred in Victoria (on the basis of population), the estimate for Victoria is about $643 million for that year. This figure includes the cost of medical misadventure and the adverse effects of prescription medication which have been excluded from the current study. The lifetime cost of treatment estimate of $759 million from the current study is not unreasonable in comparison.\n\nThe BTCE (1992) estimated that the total cost of road accidents in Australia in 1988 was $6.1 billion. This figure has remained stable with 1993 costs estimated at the same value (Lynch, 1994). However, this estimate includes costs associated with vehicle damage ($1.868 billion), pain and suffering ($1.463 billion) and insurance administration ($571 million). When these costs are factored out to approximate the costs included in this study, the remainder (consisting of direct treatment costs, lost earnings and family and community losses) totals $2.232 billion. If again, we assume that one quarter of these costs were incurred in Victoria, the cost of motor vehicle accidents in Victoria is estimated at $558 million. This corresponds well with the estimate from this study of $571 million.\n\nDespite variations in the methods used to calculate the different types of cost between this study and the US study (Rice et al, 1989), direct cost, morbidity and mortality account for similar proportions of the total lifetime costs in each case. In this study, direct costs account for 29 percent of the total, morbidity for 39 percent and mortality for 31 percent. In the US study, direct costs accounted for 29 percent of the total with morbidity accounting for 41 percent and mortality for 30 percent.\n\n• In terms of activity, sports and leisure activities are responsible for the greatest number of non-fatal injuries.\n\nWhile economic cost provides another measure of the impact of injury on the community, cost alone should not be used to determine whether or not more resources should be allocated to the prevention of injury in general or in determining priorities within the injury area.\n\nThis study provides several measures of the burden of injury which should be used in conjunction with each other to compare the impact of injury relative to other health issues and to determine priorities within injury prevention. Chapters 5 and 6 provide comprehensive epidemiological and cost data for the major injury cause categories as well as detailed disaggregations by age and gender.\n\nAs indicated in the previous section, preventability is an important factor in determining priorities for injury prevention. Future decisions on the allocation of health-care resources for injury prevention should depend on the availability of prevention options, their cost and effectiveness. This study provides baseline data against which interventions can be assessed as it provides incidence-based cost estimates which model the current care option. Resources for injury prevention are also required from those sectors in which the injuries are incurred and within whose jurisdiction action is required to implement interventions.\n\nSince there are concerns about the validity of considering productivity losses (indirect costs) as an economic consequence of disease (see Chapter 2), total lifetime costs have also been disaggregated by type : direct, morbidity and mortality. The separate components of the direct costs have also been identified as this may help policy makers and other interested parties identify the sectors on which the major burden falls.\n\nThe cost of injury data presented here is of relevance, not only to the health sector and to other sectors which pay the costs but also, to those in which the costs are incurred. Arguably, the costs result from failures in those sectors which have the responsibility as well as the jurisdiction for prevention.\n\nIt should be pointed out that considered investment in safety has already been shown to be cost effective in the road transport area. The benefits of a concerted, targeted and multi-faceted approach to road safety has been demonstrated through the progressive reduction in traffic fatalities in Victoria during the past 27 years, including a dramatic reduction of 49 percent between 1989 and 1992, which has been maintained since. Evaluations of the effectiveness of programs directed at drink driving and excessive speed during 1989-92 have shown benefits in terms of reductions in the cost of serious casualty crashes considerably more than ten times the program costs (Cameron, 1995).\n\nThis report provides an overview of the data prepared for this study. The complete dataset, held at Monash University Accident Research Centre, provides a wealth of detailed information on which additional studies could be based. The methodology developed could be applied to more specific areas such as the costs of dog bite, playground, farm, horse-riding injuries and so on.\n\nJournal articles based on this study will be submitted to international journals in 1998. Papers will also be presented at national and international conferences. Major findings from the study will also appear in the 1998 Victorian Year Book published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n• It is recommended that the possibility of linking hospital accounts data to VIMD data be investigated and made available to researchers to enable the comprehensive costing of injury within the hospital sector.\n\n• The Victorian WorkCover Authority and the Transport Accident Commission both provide a rich source of cost data for injury. It is recommended that a cost matrices (type of injury by body part) for both motor vehicle traffic injuries and all other injuries, using several years of data for robustness, be developed to provide a tool for costing studies in the future. Adjustment factors for multiple versus single injuries could also be determined. This could be updated annually by returning to the data sources or applying an adjustor based on the CPI or the movement in average payments within the payment authorities.\n\n• Payments data for children and the elderly are only available for motor vehicle injuries. It is recommended that alternate sources of data be explored to fill this gap. Alternate sources of cost data such as the Australian Army which maintains complete medical records (including costs) for all personnel and their dependants is a possible source of comprehensive cost data for child injury.\n\nVeterans Affairs may also be able to provide relevant costing for elderly patients. However, this may not reflect the general elderly population due to Veterans Affairs eligibility criteria.\n\n• Non-hospitalised injury, although usually relatively inexpensive in terms of treatment cost and morbidity represents the majority of injury cases. The costing of non-hospitalised injury is particularly difficult given that the WorkCover and Transport Accident Commission data apply to the more serious end of the spectrum due to the application of a medical excess. It is recommended that a study be conducted to investigate alternative methods of estimating the treatment costs associated with nonhospitalised injury and to determine the real extent of morbidity given that the measures used in this study were particularly conservative.\n\n• In view of the suspected large number of deaths in the elderly due to falls, which may have been omitted in this study, it is recommended that a further study be undertaken to estimate the true magnitude of this issue.\n\n• The breakdown provided in Table 6-8 indicates that sport and recreational activities result in a high number of injuries. A separate study on sports and active recreation is recommended, to identify the costs of such injury, since these categories are hidden within the thirteen cause groups specified here.\n\nAs shown in Table 6-8, the data is capable of separate analyses to identify sporting and recreational injuries, however there is a need to include specialist sports medicine clinics in the injury surveillance to develop a more complete estimate of the incidence of sports injury.\n\n• While this study provides an estimate of the total economic cost of, and life-years lost to, injury in Victoria, a study based on alternative measures such as QALYs or DALYs is recommended to complete the picture by providing information about quality of life aspects of the total societal burden of injury.\n\nInternal transfers are recorded when a change of care type occurs (eg when a patient is moved from an acute care ward to nursing home-type care or a rehabilitation unit within the same hospital).\n\nWorkCover does not include self-employed persons (such as small businessmen and farmers) and large employers who are self-insured.\n\nMethod used by BTCE to adjust values for application in later years(personal communication, Joe Motha,  BTCE)\n\npersonal communication, John Patrone, Commonwealth Dept. of Health & Family Services.\n\nNational Injury Surveillance Unit (1997) Spinal cord injury.

NOTE : Caution is required in interpreting costs for non-equivalent age-groups. However, cost per injured person can be directly compared. Totals may not add exactly due to rounding error.\n\n*Based on 1629 deaths, including an estimated 142 deaths occurring in later years as a result of injuries sustained in 1993/94.

It is therefore indicative only of the contributions of sectors other than compensation systems. 1. The Transport Accident Commission and the Victorian WorkCover Authority. 2. The proportions for each sector (apart from compensation systems) were assumed to be the same as aids and appliances. 3. Other direct costs include mainly non-medical costs paid by the TAC and to a lesser extent by WorkCover. The remainder of the estimate has been assumed to be paid by individuals. Overall, the total is likely to be an underestimate due to variations in what is covered by the two compensation systems as the majority of cases were costed using WorkCover unit costs.\n\nTotal direct costs attributed to injury and poisoning for Australia in the financial year 1993/94 was almost $2,607 million. For comparative purposes we have deducted the cost of research (estimated at $35.558 million) since this cost category was not included in this study."
