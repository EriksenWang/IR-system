    "full_text": "It is well known that the evolution of an image Ž . under certain partial differential equation PDE opw x erators is an image processing operation 1-3 . Correspondingly, an image processing operation, under appropriate restrictions, can be regarded as action of w x a PDE operator 4 . This link between PDEs and image processing has stimulated much interest in Ž . both fields. The use of linear PDE operators in image processing began with the diffusion operator and has its roots in the theory of multiscale analysis and Gaussian smoothing initiated by Rosenfeld and w x w x Thurston 1 and others 2,3 . It can be proved that the heat equation satisfies the maximum and minimum principles, which means the maximum and minimum can only be attained for the initial image w x data or at the boundary of an image 5 . Hence, the edges of an image may lose definition under the action of the diffusion operator.\n\nw x Perona and Malik 6 addressed the edge loss Ž . problem by introducing a non-linear anisotropic w x diffusion operator 6 . Such a formalism has stimuw x lated a great deal of interest 7-20 . It is commonly believed that the Perona-Malik algorithm provides a potential means for noise removing, edge detection, image segmentation and enhancement. The basic idea behind the Perona-Malik algorithm is to regard Ž . an original image I r as evolving under an edgestopping diffusion operator Eu r ,t Ž .\n\nŽ< <. where d =u is a generalized diffusion coefficient which is so designed that it limits the diffusion near edges while allowing lots of diffusion in regions where the noise is to be suppressed. The edges of an image are automatically detected by using a diffusion rate based on approximating the norm of the gradient across edges with the norm of the full image gradient. Examples of such coefficients, as suggested originally by Perona and Malik, include\n\nwhere h is a threshold value. It is well-known w x 7,9,11,13 that this anisotropic diffusion algorithm may break down when the gradient generated by noise is comparable to image edges and features. In Ž mathematical terms, the Perona-Malik equation Eq. Ž .. 1 is ill defined. This problem may be alleviated Ž . through a regularizer R r which serves both as a low-pass filter for removing high-frequency noise and as a smoother for the possible discontinuity in the original image function Eu r ,t Ž .\n\nEt 4 Ž .\n\nŽ .

Mathematically, this scheme provides a weak solution of the original Perona-Malik equation.\n\nThe purpose of this Letter is to introduce generalized reaction-diffusion equations for treating noisy images. Such equations can be derived from conservation laws and can be regarded as generalizations of Ž Ž .. the Perona-Malik equation Eq. 1 . Statistical information is used for automatic edge-stopping and noise-level estimation. A time-dependent threshold is introduced to handle possible break down due to a noise-generated gradient. A recently developed w x quasi-interpolating wavelet algorithm 21 is utilized for the numerical integration of generalized reaction-diffusion equations. The efficiency and robust-ness of the present algorithm are illustrated by its Ž . application to magnetic resonance images MRI .\n\nIn many physical situations, the edges of an image may be degraded for various reasons. In other cases, the resolution of an image can be very low; for example, X-ray breast mammogram images, where the difference in X-ray attenuation between normal and cancerous tissues is very small. Similar cases can appear in MRIs. Therefore, a direct feature enhancement is often required. We propose a realvalued edge-enhancing functional\n\nwhere N e N-`is bounded up and below. It is appropriately chosen so that a certain image feature andror the contrast of image edges are enhanced during the time propagation. This leads to a generalized reaction-diffusion equation\n\nEu r ,t Ž .\n\nŽ . For constant d and a simple form of e, Eq. 6 reduces to the inhomogeneous diffusion equation. The maximum and minimum principles are important for proving uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data for the solution of initial and boundary value problems for the diffusion equation. A strong maximum or minimum principle is known for the inhomogeneous diffusion equation and a weak maximum or minimum principle is known for the w x homogeneous diffusion equation 5 . Perona-Malik argued that their anisotropic diffusion equation has Ž . no additional maxima minima which do not belong to the initial image data. Since the source term in the Ž Ž .. generalized reaction-diffusion equation Eq. 6 is effectively non-zero only at image edges or at a feature, it retains the strong maximum or minimum principle and thus preserves image features. Ž The derivation of the diffusion equation heat . equation is based on Fourier's law for heat flux j r,t syD =u r ,t . 7\n\nHere D is a constant. This, from the point of view 1 of kinetic theory, is a simplified approximation to a quasi-homogeneous system which is near equilib- Letters 303 1999 531-536 533 rium.

Eq. 9 is an interesting reaction-diffusion equation which includes not only the usual diffusion and production terms, but also a 'super'-diffusion term.\n\nŽ . The case of second-order super-diffusion, j r,t s 2 Ž .\n\n2 Ž . yD =u r,t qND N == u r,t , has been used for 1 2 the decription of a number of physical phenomena, such as pattern formation in alloys, glasses, polymer, combustion and biological systems.\n\nIn image systems, the distribution of image pixels can be highly inhomogeneous. Hence, the general-Ž Ž .. ized reaction-diffusion equation Eq. 6 can be made more efficient for image segmentation and noise removing by incorporating an edge-sensitive super-diffusion term Eu r ,t Ž .\n\nr ,t , =u r ,t .\n\nŽ .

Obviously, these local statistical variances can be optimized for a given problem. However, we have not implemented this optimization in this work. The appropriate use of time delay t can effectively prevent the noise-break 0 down of the original Perona-Malik equation. Certainly, this concept can be implemented in a variety of ways.

Our quasi-interpolating wavelet algorithm is a discrete singular convolution method which provides a weak solution to a partial differential equation. The additional regularization operation as indicated in Ž . Eq. 4 is no longer necessary in our approach. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for the time discretization of the Perona-Malik equation and its generalizations. A reflecting boundary condition is used in time integration.\n\nŽ .

The in-Ž . crease in PSNR is quite large 20 dB with the use of the autothreshold technique and the quasi-interpolating wavelet algorithm. Fig. 1d is obtained by the combined use of the edge-enhancing functional and Ž the Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion operator Eq. Ž .. 6 . Obviously, the edge of the image is effectively enhanced by the edge-enhancing functional as indicated by an increase of PSNR of 29 dB. The performance of the full generalized Perona-Malik equation Ž Ž .. Eq. 11 is given in Fig. 1e. In this case, the PSNR is increased by 35 dB. Comparing them with the Ž . degraded image Fig. 1b , it is clearly seen that the present algorithms can effectively remove noise while simultaneously preserving the edges. The image boundary is also effectively preserved, which shows the success of the present reflecting boundary treatw x ment. As pointed out in Ref. 14 , for noisier images the Perona-Malik equation may produce some noise echoes that are larger than the threshold value and thus cannot be removed. However, increasing the threshold value leads to edge-blurring. Using the various techniques presented in this Letter and in w x Ref. 21 , we can effectively avoid the problem by accurately detecting the edges using the quasi-orthogonal wavelets. Since our quasi-interpolating wavelets are functions of the Schwartz class, the present algorithm of time integration automatically avoids having to apply an additional smoothing operation to the argument of the diffusion coefficient. We have also tested our algorithm for even nosier images and have found that it can increase the PSNR enormously.\n\nIn conclusion, we propose generalized reactiondiffusion equations for edge-detected image processing. An edge-enhancing functional is introduced for direct image enhancement. Such a term is very useful for enhancing low contrast images and edgeblurred images. We also introduce edge-detected super-diffusion operators for highly inhomogeneous images. The super-diffusion operators are very efficient for noise-removing. Statistical information is used for the automatical choice of edge-stopping threshold and for determining diffusion amplitudes. A time delay concept is used in edge-stopping coefficients for preventing high noise-level breakdown. A newly developed quasi-interpolating wavelet techw x nique 21 is used for the time integration of the PDE system. Numerical experiments on a noisy MRI sample show that the present algorithm is very effective for noise-removing and simultaneously edge-preserving. While the application addressed in this work is MRI restoration, we note that the present generalized reaction-diffusion equations have great potential for theoretical modeling of various physical phenomena, such as boundary-restricted diffusion, multiphase chemical reaction and reaction-diffusion in porous media. These aspects are under investigation."
