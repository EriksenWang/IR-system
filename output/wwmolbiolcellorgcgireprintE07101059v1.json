    "abstract": "Heterochromatic chromosomal regions undergo large-scale reorganization and progressively aggregate, forming chromocenters. These are dynamic structures that rapidly adapt to various stimuli that influence gene expression patterns, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. Np95-ICBP90 (m-and h-UHRF1) is a histone binding protein expressed only in proliferating cells. During pericentromeric heterochromatin (PH) replication, Np95 specifically relocalizes to chromocenters where it highly concentrates in the replication factories that correspond to less compacted DNA. Np95 recruits HDAC and DNMT1 to PH and depletion of Np95 impairs PH replication. Here we show that Np95 causes large-scale modifications of chromocenters independently from the H3:K9 and H4:K20 tri-methylation pathways, from the expression levels of HP1, from DNA methylation and from the cell cycle. The PHD domain is essential to induce this effect. The PHD domain is also required in vitro to increase access of a restriction enzyme to DNA packaged into nucleosomal arrays. We propose that the PHD domain of Np95-ICBP90 contributes to the opening and/or stabilization of dense chromocenter structures to support the recruitment of modifying enzymes -like HDAC and DNMT1 -required for the replication and formation of PH.",
    "full_text": "The chromosomal regions that carry constitutive heterochromatin tend to undergo largescale reorganization and to progressively aggregate to form clusters called chromocenters (Hochstrasser and Sedat, 1987). The biological significance of chromocenters is not yet fully understood. These structures, produced by the higher order conformation of various heterochromatic areas, might represent regions of permanently silenced chromatin (Polo and Almouzni, 2006). They are not static or inaccessible, but dynamic and display the potential to rapidly adapt to various stimuli that influence gene expression patterns, cell cycle progression, and cell differentiation (Cheutin et al., 2003;Festenstein and Aragon, 2003). Alterations in chromocenter number, dimension, and nuclear distribution have been observed during terminal differentiation and studies in various organisms have convincingly demonstrated a relationship between nuclear topology and transcriptional silencing (Kosak and Groudine, 2004).\n\nThese highly compacted chromatin structures are easily detectable in mouse cells; they form the characteristic nodules stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and are mainly constituted of pericentromeric heterochromatin (PH). In mammals, PH is characterized by repeated DNA sequences, by high levels of specifically methylated forms of histone H3 and H4, by deacetylated histone H4, and by methylated DNA. These epigenetic modifications represent binding substrates for chromatin modifiers, like HP1 and MeCP2, that are thought to contribute both to the highly silent environment and to the structural organization of this chromatin compartment (Maison and Almouzni, 2004;Brero et al., 2005). Apparently, the high content of repeated DNA sequences in heterochromatin enhances the condensation and aggregation properties that characterize these heterochromatin regions (Barr and Ellison, 1972).\n\nDuring middle S phase, these highly compacted structures must be opened to allow the replication machinery to proceed along DNA, and to reconstitute the epigenetic marks and the silent state of this chromatin area. It has been proposed that these events occur at the pericentromeric duplication body (pHDB) (Quivy et al., 2004), in which parental chromatin from the interior is pulled out to the periphery, becomes transiently disrupted during replication, reassembled to form new chromatin, and finally pushed back inside the domain. The molecular mechanisms that produce the dynamic conformational changes of chromocenters are poorly understood although a role for some proteins has been proposed (Brero et al., 2005).\n\nNp95 is a cell cycle regulated and histone binding protein expressed only in proliferating cells and involved in PH replication and formation (Papait et al., 2007). At the time of PH replication, Np95 specifically relocalizes to chromocenters where it gets highly concentrated in the areas of active replication known as PH duplication body (pHDB) (Quivy et al., 2004). These areas correspond to less compacted DNA where the parental DNA is pulled out from the central core of the chromocenter and replicated. Newly synthesized nucleosomes are then deposited and epigenetically modified to allow the formation of new heterochromatin domains. Np95 is part of the PH duplication body (pHDB) and its ablation in the cell strongly reduces both DNA duplication of this area and PH reformation. This involves modification of the acetylation status of lysines 8, 12 and 16 of histone H4 and the silencing of major satellite repeats. Very recent studies show that UHRF1 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells by recruiting DNMT1 to hemi-methylated DNA (Bostick et al., 2007;Sharif et al., 2007), adding more evidence for a key role of Np95 in PH replication and in the maintenance of the epigenetic modifications required for PH formation.\n\nIn this article, we investigated the possibility that Np95 might have a role in the control of large-scale reorganization of chromocenters, thereby possibly contributing to the dynamic changes of these dense chromatin areas that occur during PH replication.\n\nNIH-3T3 cells was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). The Np95 adenovirus (Ad-Np95), and adenovirus Track (Ad-Track) have been described previously (Bonapace et al., 2002).\n\nMouse Suv39h1/2 double-null (Peters et al., 2001), dnmt1, 3a and 3b triple knock-out (dnmt TKO) embryonic stem cells (Tsumura et al., 2006) and wild-type mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (SEROMED).\n\nNIH-3T3 cells were transfected with vectors expressing myc-tagged Np95 using FuGENE 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN-USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. For experiments in Figure 5, 2μg of pcDNA3.1-myc-his tag (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA-USA) recombinant plasmids containing the wt, and the deletion mutants indicated in Figure 5 were transfected into NIH3T3 and Suv39h1/2 dn cells using (Lipofectamine -Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA-USA). 48h later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 10 min or pre-treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min on ice before fixation. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by incubation in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. dnmt TKO ES cells were transfected using FuGene HD (Roche) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions For RNA interference, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA duplex using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA-USA). Two rounds of transfection were done for all experiments. Cells were analysed 24 h after the last transfection. siRNA oligos were from Ambion (Ambion, Austin, TX-USA) and the targeting sequences were: RNAi ctrl: AAAACGAGGCAGGAAAGGCGGTT; RNAi Np95: AACGCGGCTTCTGGTATGATGTT.\n\nProteins were extracted as described previously (Citterio et al., 2004). Triton X-100 extraction was performed by treating with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min on ice, followed by three washes in PBS, before lysis or immunofluorescence.\n\nImmunofluorescence procedures were as described previously (Citterio et al., 2004).\n\nAntibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonals anti: Np95 (Bonapace et al., 2002); HP1α, β and γ (Euromedex, Strasbourg -F); Goat polyclonal anti lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotech., Inc.). anti-MeCP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis -MO), anti-H:K9met3 and anti-H4:K20 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-5mC (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Secondary antibodies: Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine-USA).\n\nNuclear counterstaining was performed with DAPI. Samples for DNA-FISH were mounted in Vectashield antifade (Vector Laboratories) whereas for immunofluorescence, with Mowiol (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany).\n\nFISH with a mouse major satellite-specific probe was performed as described in (Weierich et al., 2003). In brief, NIH-3T3 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS 36h after DNA transfection. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/1x PBS followed by incubation in 20% glycerol and a repeated freezing/thawing step in liquid nitrogen. Finally, incubated in 0.1N HCl for 5 min. Until hybridization, coverslips with fixed and pretreated cells were stored in 50% formamid/2x SSC at 4°C.\n\nThe probe was generated by PCR using 5'-GACGACTTGAAAAATGACGAAATC-3' (MajF1-for) and 5'-CATATTCCAGGTCCTTCAGTGTGC-3' (MajR1-rev) as primers and pCR4-MajSat9-2 plasmid as template (kind gift from T. Jenuwein) and labeled by nick translation using Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN-USA).\n\nLabeled DNA was coprecipitated with salmon sperm DNA and mouse Cot-1. Hybridization mixture in all cases consisted of 50% formamid/10% dextran sulfate/2x SSC. Cells and probe DNA were denatured simultaneously at 75°C for 2 min and hybridization was performed for 2 or 3 days at 37°C on a hot-block in humid condiction. Post-hybridization washes were performed with 2x SSC at 37° C and 0.1x SSC at 60°C, respectively. Bio-16-dUTP in major satellite probe was detected by two layers of avidin-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) and FITC-conjugated goat-anti-avidin antibodies (Vector Laboratories).\n\nCells were analyzed with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with 100X plan. Pictures were acquired with a colour camera (Olympus DP50). Blots were digitalized with an EPSON scan system (EPSON expression 1600 Pro, Long Beach, CA).\n\nAll pictures were managed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA-USA) and Canvas (Deneba Software, Miami, FL-USA). Quantitative analysis of chromocenters of Figure 1 were done with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nNucleosome arrays were reconstituted on 2.8kb plasmid pFM218-H5 by high-salt dialysis using a modification of published methods (Baumann et al., 2003). Briefly, plasmid DNA and histones extracted from CV1 cells were mixed in 2M NaCl/TE buffer plus 0.05% Np40.\n\nThe Histone:DNA weight ratio was usually 1.5:1. Reconstitution mixes were reduced by dialysis at 26°C from 2M to 50 mM NaCl/TE/Np40 buffer. For each accessibility assay, arrays contained 25ng of DNA. Assays were performed for 3 hours at 30°C in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Hcl (pH7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 4 MgCl2, 4 mM ATP (pH8), 2μg of GST, 1 or 2μg GST-Np95, or 200ng of Brg1, or 200ng of Drosophila nuclear extracts and 4 units of Sfc1 restriction enzyme. Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized by hybridization with radiolabled pFM218-H5 plasmid DNA.\n\nNp95 relocalization to chromocenters at the time of PH replication leads to a high concentration of the protein in these areas. Specific colocalization of Np95 with replication factories, that always corresponds with a less compacted DNA, suggested to us a possible role of the protein in chromocenter dynamics. We reasoned that if Np95 has a role in this process, we would expect that quantitative variations of the protein in the cell would lead to major changes in chromocenter structure.\n\nTo this end, we treated NIH-3T3 cells with small interfering RNA against Np95, which resulted in a reduction of Np95 protein. This caused clustering of PH, visualized by a reduction in the number (Fig. 1A; compare picture 3 with 4; Fig. 1B: compare picture 7 with 8) and an increase in the size (Fig. 1B; compare picture 7 with 8) of the intense DAPI spots corresponding to chromocenters. We performed a quantitative analysis with ImageJ software (NIH; 1,32j version) to calculate the number and the size of chromocenters in RNAi-ctrl and RNAi-Np95 treated cells (Fig. 1B, pictures 9 and 10). The analysis of approximately 200 cells per experiment per treatment is visualized in Fig. 1C and D. In RNAi-Np95 experiments, 88% of the cells display 20 or less chromocenters, while in RNAictrl experiments less than 42% of cells display this number of chromocenters (Fig. 1C), as shown previously for NIH-3T3 cells (Cerda et al., 1999). The differences become more obvious when counting the number of cells that display 15 or less chromocenters: more than 57% in the RNAi-Np95 treated cells and around 13% in RNAi-ctrl treated cells. The average size of the chromocenters in RNAi-Np95 treated cells is more than double with respect to the RNAi-ctrl cells (Fig. 1D).\n\nClustering of chromocenters (present results) and impairment of PH replication in the absence of Np95 (Papait et al., 2007), together with the specific relocalization of Np95 to PH in middle S phase and association to the areas of less dense chromatin (Papait et al., 2007), argue in favour of a role of the protein in chromocenter dynamics.\n\nClustering of PH is independent from alterations of HP1, histone H3:K9 and H4:K20 methylation.\n\nWe next checked if this clustering was accompanied by modifications of H3:K9 and H4:K20 tri-methylation levels, two of the most relevant epigenetic modifications of this chromatin compartment. We also monitored the distribution and expression level of HP1, a key protein for PH organisation.\n\nAs Fig. 2 shows, no significant alterations of these three pericentromeric markers are observed in RNAi-Np95 experiments. The increased size of HP1, H3:K9met3 and H4:K20met3 dots observed in the absence of Np95, in fact, parallels the variations observed for the DAPI staining (compare in Fig. 2A pictures b, e, h, k, n, and q respectively with c, f, i, l, o, r). Western blots performed on protein extracts obtained from Np95 depleted or control cells indicate no major alterations of these markers, even when cells were pre-treated with Triton-X100 to extract proteins weakly bound to chromatin (Fig. 2B). A slight increase in HP1alpha and H4:K20met3 was observed.\n\nA recent study by Wong and co-workers (Karagianni et al., 2008) has shown that ICBP90 and Np95 specifically bind to H3:K9met3 and that in Suv39h1/2dn cells Np95 is delocalized. We performed a detailed analysis of the cell cycle distribution of Np95 in Suv39h1/2dn cells (a kind gift of Dr. T. Jenuwein) (figure 3). We found that i) Suv39h1/2dn cells grow much slower than NIH-3T3 cells, and in the majority of the asynchronous growing cells Np95 appears as diffused as H3:K9met3 (Fig. 3A; arrows indicate the cells in which Np95 colocalizes with chromocenters), a typical well known pattern of Np95 in G1 cells (Uemura et al., 2000;Miura et al., 2001;Papait et al., 2007); ii) in synchronized Suv39h1/2dn cells, as expected, Np95 appears diffused at the G1/S boundary, but shows a higher concentration at the chromocenters at the onset of S phase and clearly relocalizes to the dense DAPI dots at the time of heterochromatin replication with a pattern indistinguishable from NIH-3T3 cells (Uemura et al., 2000;Papait et al., 2007) (Fig. 3B, lanes Middle S -II and IIIA) and it is part of the pHDB (Quivy et al., 2004) (Fig. 3C). We conclude that Np95s distribution is independent from the tri-methylation status of lysine 9 of histone H3.\n\nAltogether, these experiments indicate that in the absence of Np95 the clustering of PH we detect occurs independently from the nuclear distribution pattern and methylation status of H3:K9 and H4:K20 and from the expression levels of HP1. These results suggest that chromocenter aggregation observed in the absence of Np95 is due to mechanisms that are independent from the known epigenetic markers that are critical for gene silencing and PH organization. They also show that lower amounts of Np95 induce the clustering of PH, suggesting that this protein might have a role in the regulation of chromocenter number and size.\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, we over-expressed Np95-ICBP90 in NIH-3T3 cells. In Figure 4, we show that infection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing Np95 (AdNp95, (Bonapace et al., 2002)), but not the control adenovirus (AdTRACK), causes an alteration of the immunofluorescence distribution of HP1 in a dose dependent manner (see Fig. 4C for the over-expression levels of Np95 after infection). HP1 is displaced from the heterochromatic DAPI spots and becomes diffused in the nucleoplasm (compare pictures b with e, h and m in Fig. 4A and 4B). The effect on HP1 was confirmed by transfection experiments, which showed that over-expression of recombinant myc-tagged Np95-wt protein displaced all three forms of endogenous HP1 (HP1-α, -β, and -γ) from PH (Fig. 4D; compare pictures b, h and p, respectively with e, m and s). Confocal microscopy corroborated the results (Fig. 4E; compare pictures b with e). The same outcome was obtained with transfection of myc-tagged ICBP90-wt protein, indicating that higher cellular levels of either the human and the murine proteins displace HP1 from PH (Fig. 4F; compare pictures b with e).\n\nindependently from the H3:K9 tri-methylation pathway, from DNA methylation and from the cell cycle. Surprisingly, we also observed major changes in size, form and distribution of the chromocenters that seemed to gradually dissolve after over-expression of both Np95 and the human orthologue ICBP90 (Fig. 4A and 4B; compare picture c with f, i and n; Fig. 4D;  compare pictures c, i and q, respectively with f, n and t). At moderate levels of Np95 over-expression (MOI 60), DAPI nodules begun to change their characteristic 'spot' pattern by assuming a more diffuse distribution in the nucleus. At higher levels of expression (MOI 120), DAPI spots became completely dispersed and the chromocenters were no longer distinguishable in the nucleus.\n\nFluorescent in situ hybridization with a major satellite probe showed that dispersion of DAPI-bright chromocenters is accompanied by a similar decondensation of pericentromeric statellite DNA (Lehnertz et al., 2003) (Fig. 4G, compare picture b with e).\n\nImmunodecoration of over-expressed and fixed cells with antibodies against tri-methylated H3:K9 and H4:K20 shows that the distribution of these PH markers mirrors the altered DAPI staining (Fig. 5A; compare respectively pictures 4 and 6 with 13 and 15; and 7 and 9 with 16 and 18). Strikingly, the decondensation effect of chromocenters is observed also in Suv39h1/2dn double null cells, which lack H3:K9met3, and in dnmt TKO ES cells, which lack DNA methylation. (Tsumura et al., 2006) (Fig. 5A; compare respectively pictures 19 and 21 with 22 and 24 for the Suv39h1/2dn cells, in this case the specific Ab utilized is anti-5methyl-cytosine; and 26 with 28 for TKO cells). MeCP2 has been shown to play a relevant role in chromocenter dynamics, and to induce chromocenter clustering during terminal differentiation and in over-expression independently from the H3:K9 trimethylation pathway (Brero et al., 2005). Fig. 5A (pictures 10, 11 and 12) shows that overexpression of Np95 delocalizes MeCP2, which also mirrors the altered DAPI staining. This suggests that over-expression of Np95 is able to counteract the chromocenter clustering effect of MeCP2.\n\nWestern blot experiments conducted on protein extracts from cells over-expressing Np95 showed no significant variations in the overall methylation state of H3:K9 or H4:K20 or in the level of expression of HP1 or MeCP2 (Fig. 5B, left panel). At very high levels of overexpression and after pre-treatment with Triton-X100, however, a slight decrease of the tightly chromatin-bound levels of HP1 and MeCP2 are seen (Fig. 5B, right panel).\n\nNevertheless, at a multiplicity of infection 60 (MOI-60), which is sufficient to induce largescale chromocenter modifications (see Fig. 4A), the levels of H3:K9met3, H4:K20met3, MeCP2 and HP1 are comparable to controls (compare in Fig. 5B lanes Ad-Np95 60 -all antibodies -with Track 120).\n\nThe delocalization of HP1 and the dissolving effect on chromocenters was also independent of the cell cycle. Over-expression of Ad-Np95 in serum starved NIH-3T3 cells, a cell cycle phase in which the protein is completely absent, had the same effect than in asynchronously growing cells (Fig. 5C).\n\nThe pattern of BrdU incorporation in growing cells after transfection of recombinant myc-tagged Np95-wt reflected the altered DNA organization. No specific replication foci were observable and the BrdU was distributed homogenously throughout the nucleus (Fig. 5D)although it resulted less intense -, once more indicating that higher amounts of Np95 profoundly modified chromatin organization.\n\nAltogether, these results indicate that large-scale chromocenter modifications induced by the over-expression of Np95 are independent of the H3:K9met3-H4:K20met3-HP1 pathways, DNA methylation, the clustering activity of MeCP2 and from the cell cycle.\n\nThe PHD domain is essential for the large-scale changes in chromocenter structure.\n\nTo investigate which domain of Np95-ICBP90 is involved in large-scale chromocenter modifications, we performed over-expression experiments in NIH3T3, Suv39h1/2dn and TKO cells with various recombinant Np95 deletion mutants.\n\nNp95 contains several protein domains. Progressing from the N to the C terminus, these are: a Ub-like domain, a putative nuclear localization signal, a PHD domain, an SRA-YDG domain and a RING finger domain (Fig. 6B). In a previous study, we showed that Np95 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (Citterio et al., 2004). The SRA-YDG domain has been implicated in the control of DNA methylation (Unoki et al., 2004;Bostick et al., 2007;Johnson et al., 2007;Sharif et al., 2007), the recruitment of HDAC (Unoki et al., 2004), and transcriptional silencing of major satellites (Papait et al., 2007). We constructed deletion mutants of each of these domains (Fig. 6B) and evaluated the effects of their expression on the stability of chromocenters by immunoflurescence with antibodies against HP1α and by staining the PH areas with DAPI. Only those constructs retaining the PHD domain (Fig. 6B, Np95-wt, -1-719, 1-590, 1-419, 82-782, Δ-SRA) were able to disaggregate chromocenters and to delocalized HP1α from PH regions (Fig. 6A; for HP1 compare images N° 12,13 ,14,15,17 and 18 with 16,19 and 20;for DAPI compare images N° 22,23,24,25 and 27 with 26,29 and 30). Deletion of the PHD domain only (Fig. 6A, Δ During PH replication in middle S phase, the bulk of Np95 specifically re-localizes to and gets highly concentrated in the chromocenters where it occupies the areas of less compacted DNA that correspond to \"replication factories\". The disaggregating effects we observe on chromocenters in over-expression experiments suggest that, in living cells, Np95 might contribute to the opening and/or stabilization of the dense chromatic structure to support the access and recruitment of modifying enzymes required for replication and formation of PH.\n\nWe therefore used in vitro experiments to investigate if Np95 is able to facilitate the access to modifying enzymes (restriction enzyme Sfc1) to DNA (pFM218-H5 plasmid) packaged into nucleosome arrays (Fig. 7A). This type of assay has been used by various authors to assess the chromatin accessibility activity of various protein complexes in vitro (Almer et al., 1986); (Varga-Weisz et al., 1997); (Shen et al., 2000); (Boyer et al., 2000); (Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002). Recombinant GST-Np95 was incubated with reconstituted chromatin in the presence or absence of the restriction enzyme Sfc1, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized by hybridization with radio-labelled pFM218-H5 plasmid DNA. Figure 7B shows that 1 or 2 μg of GST-Np95, (Fig. 7B, lanes 6 and 7), 2μg of ICBP90 (Fig. 7B, lane 14) and 200ng of the positive control (Drosophila nuclear extracts) (Fig. 7B, lane 5), but not 2μg of GST alone (Fig. 7B, lane 4), increase access of a restriction enzyme to packaged DNA (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 6). Figure 7 further shows that deletion of the PHD domain, but not of the SRA domain strongly reduces this activity, although it does not abolish it (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 6-7 with 8-9, 10-11 and 12-13).\n\nAltogether, these experiments indicate that Np95, by means of its PHD domain, is able to disaggregate chromocenters in vivo and to facilitate the access to DNA modifying enzymes in vitro. We suggest that Np95-ICBP90, when it specifically relocates to PH in middle S phase and becomes highly concentrated in the pHDB, could actively participate to render the chromatin of chromocenters more dynamic and potentially more accessible to modifying enzymes, such as HDAC and DNMT1.\n\nIn this article, we provide evidence that Np95 determines large-scale modifications of chromocenters and that the PHD domain is required for this process. Depletion of Np95 leads to a reduction in the number and a size increase of chromocenters, while overexpression of Np95-ICBP90 induces decondensation of chromocenters.\n\nRemarkably, the dissolving effect on chromocenters is independent from the H3:K9/K4:K20met3/HP1 pathway, from DNA methylation and from the cell cycle. In Suv39h1/2dn and in dnmt TKO cells, indeed, over-expression of Np95 leads to the disappearance of the DAPI nodules. In NIH-3T3 cells, neither the histone tri-methylation pattern in PH nor the expression levels of HP1 are significantly affected after Np95 depletion or over-expression. This, however, is not surprising because several studies show that the H3:K9 methylation pathway is not involved in chromocenter dynamics.\n\nAccumulation of HP1 in PH regions does not cause large-scale chromocenter modifications (Mateos-Langerak et al., 2007). The number and size of chromocenters in Suv39h1/2dn cells are comparable to control cells (Peters et al., 2001). Large-scale rearrangements of PH induced during terminal differentiation of muscle cells and by overexpression of MeCP2 are independent from H3:K9met3 and from HP1 levels (Brero et al., 2005). In plants, the methyltransferase suvh4 mutant has normal chromocenters although H3:K9met2 is strongly reduced (Jasencakova et al., 2003;Naumann et al., 2005;Zemach et al., 2005).\n\nIt has also been suggested that extensive DNA methylation is not necessary for PH clustering. The DNA-methyl-binding protein MeCP2 was shown to assemble secondary chromatin structures independently from the methylated DNA-binding domain and from DNA methylation (Georgel et al., 2003). However, during muscle terminal differentiation the MBD domain of MeCP2 and of other MBD containing proteins seems to be necessary and sufficient to increase percientromeric clustering (Brero et al., 2005). In plants, disruption of chromocenter structures during dedifferentiation of specialized mesophyll cells into undifferentiated protoplasts is not accompanied by changes in DNA or H3:K9 methylation and in transcriptional reactivation of silent genomic elements (Tessadori et al., 2007). The severe DNA hypomethylation mutants ddm1-5, ddm1-2, met1-1, and hog1 only show a limited decondensation of chromocenter heterochromatin (Mittelsten Scheid et al., 2002;Probst et al., 2003). Deletion of Np95 results in a drastic reduction of DNA methylation levels in mouse ES cells and embryos (Bostick et al., 2007;Sharif et al., 2007). Our results indicate that loss of Np95 increases chromocenters size and that overexpression of Np95 in TKO cells disaggregates chromocenters, once more suggesting that the chromocenter dynamics we observe is independent from DNA methylation.\n\nAlterations in chromocenter structure by Np95 must, therefore, depend on different processes. We show that PHD is the domain required in vivo for the profound alterations of chromocenters structure following over-expression of Np95-ICBP90. It has been shown that a RING point domain, but not ICBP90wt causes large-scale chromocenter changes (Karagianni et al., 2008). Our experiments in at least three type of mouse cells (NIH-3T3, Suv39h1/2dn and TKO) indicate that over-expression of Np95-ICBP90wt or of the deletion mutants Δ-SRA, Δ-RING, Δ-ubiquitin-like domain (82-782), but not Δ-PHD always causes large-scale chromocenter modifications. Significant sequence differences have been found in PHD domains and, accordingly, various activities have been assigned to this domain (Bienz, 2006). The PHD domain is an important chromatin-binding module and is crucial for the function of proteins within chromatin-associated complexes that display chromatin-modifying activities, like Dnmt3L (Jia et al., 2007), BHC80 (Lan et al., 2007), ACF-1 (Eberharter et al., 2004), BPTF (Wysocka et al., 2006). The deletion or functional impairment of the C-terminal PHD finger of ACF1 profoundly affected the nucleosome mobilization capability of associated SNF2H in trans. Some of these complexes have been implicated in DNA replication (Corona and Tamkun, 2004) and the ACF1-SNF2H complex specifically in PH replication (Collins et al., 2002).\n\nOur in vitro experiments show that the PHD of Np95 is required to facilitate the access of a restriction enzyme (Sfc1) to DNA packaged into nucleosome arrays, suggesting that in vivo this domain might enhance Np95s chromatin binding ability and favour the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. Indeed, the PHD domain of Np95 has a role in chromatin binding, although the SRA is critical (Citterio et al., 2004). Although a recent publication (Karagianni et al., 2008) shows that the PHD and SRA domains of Np95 are required for preferential binding to H3:K9met3 and that Np95 in Suv39h1/2dn cells does not bind heterochromatin, our experiments performed on those cells clearly show that the protein distribution is not affected by that genetic background (Fig. 3). In synchronized Suv39h1/2dn cells, Np95 exhibits foci of PH staining over a more diffuse pattern at the onset of S phase, relocalizes to chromocenters at the time of PH replication and is part of the pHDB, as it does in NIH-3T3 cells. A possible interpretation of this discrepancy is that Suv39h1/2dn cells grow slower and most cells are in G1, a cell cycle phase in which Np95 is well known to appear diffused in the nucleoplasm (Uemura et al., 2000;Miura et al., 2001;Papait et al., 2007).\n\nThe PHD mediated large-scale PH reorganization, might reflect changes that occur at a yet unknown level of chromatin organization and disrupts the structure of chromocenters, producing an open chromatin configuration. This view is reinforced by our FISH experiments that show that major satellite DNA is disaggregated along with chromocenters. At the time of PH replication, the bulk of Np95 re-localizes to the chromocenters and always associates with the pHDB, which corresponds to the less dense chromatin areas. In these partially disaggregated chromocenter areas, parental DNA is pulled out and duplicated by the replication machinery (Quivy et al., 2004). We propose the hypothesis that the PHD domain of Np95 is involved in PH replication and formation by contributing to the 'opening' of this chromatin compartment during replication.\n\nThe SRA domain would recruit HDAC1 (Unoki et al., 2004;Papait et al., 2007), contributing to the establishment of the repressive environment that produces major satellite transcriptional repression (Papait et al., 2007). Our results showing chromocenter clustering and impairment of PH replication following Np95 depletion, are an indirect confirmation of this hypothesis.\n\nThe results described here, together with our previous studies, tend to suggest that higher amounts of this protein would contribute to a 'proliferating' competence of the cells, This is consistent with the observation of Np95-ICBP90 over-expression in many tumours (Mousli et al., 2003;Crnogorac-Jurcevic et al., 2005;Jenkins et al., 2005). Indeed, large-scale positional or structural modifications of heterochromatin have key roles in cellular transformation (Zink et al., 2004) and may involve epigenetic regulation of gene expression (van Driel et al., 2003).\n\nIn conclusion, we propose that Np95-ICBP90 has an important role for chromocenter dynamics that is accomplished independently from the H3:K9-H4:K20-HP1 pathway and from DNA methylation, and that the PHD domain has an important role for chromocenter dynamics and might actively participate to the replication and reformation of PH domains in middle S phase.   replication sites was classified into the five major types of patterns during S-phase that have been shown to be identical in primary, immortalized and transformed mammalian cells: IA and IB, Early S and euchromatin replication; II and IIIA, Middle S, pericentromeric heterochromatin replication; IIIB, Late S, replication of centromeric heterochromatin and other structures (Ma et al., 1998;Dimitrova and Berezney, 2002).
