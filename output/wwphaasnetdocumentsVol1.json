The Armstrong Laboratory Environics Directorate (AL/EQ), an element of the Air Force Human Systems Center, began its research and development program in bioventing in 1988 with a study at Hill Air Force Base (AFB), Utah. Follow-on efforts included field research studies at Tyndall AFB, Florida, Eielson AFB, Alaska, and F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, to monitor and optimize process variables. Results from these research efforts led to the Bioventing Initiative and are discussed in this document. The AFCEE's Bioventing Initiative has involved conducting field treatability studies to evaluate bioventing feasibility at more than 125 sites throughout the United States. At those sites where feasibility studies produced positive results, pilot-scale bioventing systems were installed and operated for 1 year. Results from these pilot-scale studies have culminated in production of this document. The U.S. EPA's Bioremediation Field Initiative was established to provide the U.S. EPA and state project managers, consulting engineers, and industry with timely information regarding new developments in the application of bioremediation at hazardous waste sites. This program has sponsored field research to enable the U.S. EPA laboratories to more fully document newly developing bioremediation technologies. As part of the U.S. EPA Bioremediation Field Initiative, the U.S. EPA has contributed to the Air Force Bioventing Initiative in the development of the test plan for conducting the pilot-scale bioventing studies and assisted in the development of this manual. The results from bioventing research and development efforts and from the pilot-scale bioventing systems have been used to produce this -volume manual. Although this design manual has been written based on extensive experience with petroleum hydrocarbons (and thus, many examples use this contaminant), the concepts here should be applicable to any aerobically biodegradable compound. The manual provides details on bioventing principles; site characterization; field treatability studies; system design, installation, and operation; process monitoring; site closure; and optional technologies to combine with bioventing if warranted. This first volume describes the basic principles of bioventing. The second volume focuses on bioventing design and process monitoring.\n\nBioventing is the process of aerating soils to stimulate in situ biological activity and promote bioremediation. Bioventing typically is applied in situ to the vadose zone and is applicable to any chemical that can be aerobically biodegraded, but to date has been implemented primarily at petroleumcontaminated sites. Through the efforts of the U.S. Air Force Bioventing Initiative and the U.S. EPA Bioremediation Field Initiative, bioventing has been implemented at more than 150 sites and has emerged as one of the most cost-effective and efficient technologies currently available for vadose zone remediation of petroleum-contaminated sites. This document is a culmination of the experience gained from these sites and provides specific guidelines on the principles and practices of bioventing.\n\nMuch of the hydrocarbon residue at a fuel-contaminated site is found in the vadose zone soils, in the capillary fringe, and immediately below the water table (Figure 1-1). Seasonal water table fluctuations typically spread residues in the area immediately above and below the water table.\n\nConventional physical treatment in the past involved pump-and-treat systems where groundwater was pumped out of the ground, treated, and either discharged or reinjected. Although useful for preventing continued migration of contaminants, these systems rarely achieved typical cleanup goals. Bioventing systems are designed to remove the contaminant source from the vadose zone, thereby preventing future and/or continued contamination of the groundwater.\n\nA typical bioventing system is illustrated in Figure 1-2. Although bioventing is related to the process of soil vacuum extraction (SVE), the primary objectives of these two bioremediation technologies are different. Soil vacuum extraction is designed and operated to maximize the volatilization of lowmolecular-weight compounds, with some biodegradation occurring. In contrast, bioventing is designed to maximize biodegradation of aerobically biodegradable compounds, regardless of their molecular weight, with some volatilization occurring. The major distinction between these technologies is that the objective of soil venting is to optimize removal by volatilization, while the objective of bioventing is to optimize biodegradation while minimizing volatilization and capital and utility costs. Although both technologies involve venting of air though the subsurface, the differences in objectives result in different design and operation of the remedial systems.\n\nThe following chapters provide an overview of the principles of bioventing in relation to physical, chemical, and microbial processes occurring in the field. An overview of the development of bioventing, including development of the Bioventing Initiative is provided as a basis for the data September 29, 1995 presented in this document. Data from Bioventing Initiative sites are used throughout this document to illustrate principles of bioventing as determined from field testing.\n\nThis chapter is intended to provide a framework for this document, describing the development and structure of the Bioventing Initiative and, ultimately, this document. This chapter provides an overview of bioventing, covering oxygen supply in situ -the dominant issue in the evolution of bioventing, early bioventing studies which led to development of the Bioventing Initiative, the final structure of treatability studies and bioventing system design used for the Bioventing Initiative and, finally, emerging techniques that are being investigated as modifications to the conventional bioventing design described in this document.\n\nOne of the main driving forces behind the development of bioventing was the difficulty in delivering oxygen in situ. Many contaminants, especially the petroleum hydrocarbons found in fuels, are biodegradable if oxygen is available. Traditionally, enhanced bioreclamation processes used water to carry oxygen or an alternative electron acceptor to the contaminated zone. This was common whether the contamination was present in the groundwater or in the unsaturated zone. Media for adding oxygen to contaminated areas have included pure oxygen-sparged water, air-sparged water, hydrogen peroxide, and air.\n\nIn all cases where water is used, the solubility of oxygen is the limiting factor. At standard conditions, a maximum of 8 to 10 mg/L of oxygen can be obtained in water when aerated, while 40 to 50 mg/L can be obtained if sparged with pure oxygen, and up to 500 mg/L of oxygen theoretically can be supplied utilizing 1,000 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide. Using the stoichiometric equation shown as Equation (2-1)foot_1 , the quantity of water which must be delivered to provide sufficient oxygen for biodegradation can be calculated.\n\nAn example of calculating the mass of water that must be delivered for hydrocarbon degradation\n\nTable 2-1 summarizes oxygen requirements based on the supplied form of oxygen. September 29, 1995\n\nDue to the low aqueous solubility of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide has been tested as an oxygen source in laboratory studies and at several field sites (Hinchee et al., l991a;Aggarwal et al., 1991;Morgan and Watkinson, 1992). As shown in Table 2-1, if 500 mg/L of dissolved oxygen can be supplied via hydrogen peroxide, the mass of water that must be delivered is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Initially, these calculations made the use of hydrogen peroxide appear to be an attractive alternative to injecting air-saturated water.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is miscible in water and decomposes to release water and oxygen as shown in\n\nMany substances commonly present in groundwater and soils act as catalysts for the decomposition of peroxide. Important among these are aqueous species of iron and copper, and the enzyme catalase (Schumb et al., 1955), which has significant activity in situ (Spain et al., 1989). If\n\nTable 2-1. Oxygen Requirements Based on Supplied Form of Oxygen Oxygen Form Oxygen Concentration in H 2 O Volume to Degrade 1 lb Hydrocarbon Air-saturated H 2 O 8 to 10 mg/L 47,000 gallons (180,000 L) Oxygen-saturated H 2 O 40 to 50 mg/L 11,000 gallons (42,000 L) Hydrogen peroxide Up to 500 mg/L 1,600 gallons (6,100 L) Air NA (21 % vol/vol in air) 170 ft 3 (4,800 L)\n\nthe rate of oxygen formation from hydrogen peroxide decomposition exceeds the rate of microbial oxygen utilization, gaseous oxygen may form due to its limited aqueous solubility. Gaseous oxygen may form bubbles that may not be transported efficiently in groundwater, resulting in ineffective oxygen delivery.\n\nPhosphate is commonly used in nutrient formulations in an effort to decrease the rate of peroxide decomposition in groundwater applications (Britton, 1985). However, the effectiveness of phosphate addition in stabilizing peroxide injected into an aquifer has not been well established and conflicting results have been reported by different researchers (American Petroleum Institute, 1987;Brown et al., 1984;Downey et al., 1988;Huling et al., 1990;Morgan and Watkinson, 1992).\n\nA field experiment was conducted by Hinchee et al. (199la) to examine the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide as an oxygen source for in situ biodegradation. The study was performed at a JP-4 jet fuel-contaminated site at Eglin AFB, Florida. Site soils consisted of fine-to coarse-grained quartz sand with groundwater at a depth of 2 to 6 ft (0.61 to 1.8 m). Previous studies by Downey et al. (1988) and Hinchee et al. (1989) at the same site had shown that rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurred, even with the addition of phosphate as a peroxide stabilizer. In subsequent studies, hydrogen peroxide was injected at a concentration of 300 mg/L both with and without the addition of a phosphate-containing nutrient solution. As in previous studies, hydrogen peroxide decomposition was rapid, resulting in poor distribution of oxygen in groundwater. Addition of the phosphate-containing nutrient solution did not appear to improve hydrogen peroxide stability.\n\nOther attempts have been made using hydrogen peroxide as an oxygen source. Although results indicate better hydrogen peroxide stability than achieved by Hinchee et al. (1989), it was September 29, 1995 concluded that most of the hydrogen peroxide decomposed rapidly (Huling et al., 1990). Some degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons appears to have occurred; however, no change in total hydrocarbon contamination levels was detected in the soils (Ward, 1988).\n\nIn contrast to hydrogen peroxide use, when air is used as an oxygen source in unsaturated soil, 170 ft 3 (4,800 L) of air must be delivered to provide the minimum oxygen required to degrade 1 lb (0.45 kg) of hydrocarbon (Table 2-1). Since costs associated with water-based delivery of oxygen can be relatively high, the use of gas-phase delivery results in a significant reduction in the cost associated with supplying oxygenfoot_2 .\n\nAn additional advantage of using a gas-phase process is that gases have greater diffusivity than liquids. At many sites, geologic heterogeneities cause fluid that is pumped through the formation to be channeled into the more-permeable pathways (e.g., in an alluvial soil with interbedded sand and clay, all of the fluid flow initially takes place in the sand). As a result, oxygen must be delivered to the lesspermeable clay lenses through diffusion. In a gaseous system (as found in unsaturated soils), this diffusion can be expected to take place at rates at least three orders of magnitude greater than rates in a liquid system (as is found in saturated soils). Although it is not realistic to expect diffusion to aid significantly in water-based bioreclamation, diffusion of oxygen in a gas-phase system is a significant mechanism for oxygen delivery to less-permeable zones.\n\nGiven the advantages of using air rather than water as the oxygen source, several investigators began exploring the feasibility of an air-based oxygen supply system as a remedial option. A summary of the results of these investigations is presented in Section 2.2.\n\nFigure 2-1 provides a historical perspective of bioventing research and development. To the authors' knowledge, the first documented evidence of unsaturated zone biodegradation resulting from forced aeration was reported by the Texas Research Institute, Inc., in a 1980 study for the American Petroleum Institute. A large-scale model experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of a surfactant treatment to enhance the recovery of spilled gasoline. The experiment accounted for only 8 gallons (30 L) of the 65 gallons (250 L) originally spilled and raised questions about the fate of the September 29, 1995 gasoline. Subsequently, a column study was conducted to determine a diffusion coefficient for soil venting. This column study evolved into a biodegradation study in which it was concluded that as much as 38% of the fuel hydrocarbons were biologically mineralized. Researchers concluded that venting not only would remove gasoline by physical means, but also would enhance microbial activity and promote biodegradation of the gasoline (Texas Research Institute , 1980; 1984).\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, the first actual field-scale bioventing experiments were conducted by Jack van Eyk for Shell Research. In 1982, at van Eyk's direction, the Shell Laboratory in Amsterdam,\n\nThe Netherlands initiated a series of experiments to investigate the effectiveness of bioventing for treating hydrocarbon-contaminated soils. These studies were reported in a series of papers (Anonymous, 1986;Staatsuitgeverij, 1986;van Eyk and Vreeken, 1988;1989a;and 1989b). Wilson and Ward (1986) suggested that using air as a carrier for oxygen could be 1,000 times more efficient than using water, especially in deep, hard-to-flood unsaturated zones. They made the connection between oxygen supply via soil venting and biodegradation by observing that \"soil venting uses the same principle to remove volatile components of the hydrocarbon.\" In a general overview of the soil venting process, Bennedsen et al. (1987) concluded that soil venting provides large quantities of oxygen to the unsaturated zone, possible stimulating aerobic degradation. They suggested that water and nutrients also would be required for significant degradation and encouraged additional investigation into this area.\n\nBiodegradation enhanced by soil venting has been observed at several field sites. Investigators claim that at a soil venting site for remediation of gasoline-contaminated soil, significant biodegradation occurred (measured by a temperature rise) when air was supplied. Investigators pumped pulses of air through a pile of excavated soil and observed a consistent rise in temperature, which they attributed to biodegradation. They claimed that the pile was cleaned up during the summer primarily by biodegradation (Conner, 1989). However, they did not control for natural volatilization from the aboveground pile, and not enough data were published to critically review their biodegradation claim.\n\nResearchers at Traverse City, Michigan, observed a decrease in the toluene concentration in unsaturated zone soil gas, which they measured as an indicator of fuel contamination in the unsaturated zone. They assumed that advection had not occurred and attributed the toluene loss to biodegradation.\n\nThe investigators concluded that because toluene concentrations decayed near the September 29, 1995 oxygenated ground surface, soil venting is an attractive remediation alternative for biodegrading light volatile hydrocarbon spills (Ostendorf and Kampbell, 1989).\n\nThe U.S. Air Force initiated its research and development program in bioventing in 1988 with a study at Site 914 1 , Hill AFB, Utah. This site initially was operated as a soil vapor extraction unit, but was modified to a bioventing system after 9 months of operation because there was evidence of biodegradation and in an effort to reduce costs by reducing off-gas. Moisture and nutrient addition were studied at this site; however, while moisture addition appeared to improve biodegradation, nutrient addition did not. Final soil sampling demonstrated that benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) levels were reduced to below regulatory levels, and this site became the first Air Force site that was closed through in situ bioremediation. During this study, it became apparent that bioventing had great potential for remediating JP-4 jet fuel-contaminated soils. It also was apparent that additional research would be needed before the technology could be applied routinely in the field.\n\nFollowing the Site 914, Hill AFB study, a more controlled bioventing study was completed at\n\nTyndall AFB 2 , Florida. This study was designed to monitor specific process variables and the subsequent effect on biodegradation of hydrocarbons. Several important findings resulted from this work, including the effect of air flowrates on removal by biodegradation and volatilization, the effect of temperature on biodegradation rates, the lack of microbial stimulation from the addition of moisture and nutrients, and the importance of natural nitrogen supply through nitrogen fixation. In addition, initial and final contaminant measurements showed over 90% removal of BTEX. Although this study was short-term, it illustrated the effectiveness of bioventing.\n\nThe studies conducted at Hill and Tyndall AFBs provided valuable information on bioventing.\n\nHowever, it was apparent that long-term, controlled bioventing studies were necessary to fully evaluate and optimize the technology. In 1991, long-term bioventing studies were initiated at Site 280, Hill AFB, Utah and at Site 20, Eielson AFB, Alaska 3 . These studies were joint efforts between the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Air Force Environics Directorate of the Armstrong Laboratory. These studies were joint efforts between the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Air Force Environics Directorate of the Armstrong Laboratory. These studies have involved intensive monitoring of several process variables, including the effect of soil temperature on biodegradation rates, surface emission analyses, and optimization of flowrate.\n\nBased on the success of these previous studies, in 1992, AFCEE initiated the Bioventing Initiative where pilot-scale bioventing systems were installed at 125 contaminated sites located throughout the continental United States and in Hawaii, Alaska, and Johnston Atoll (Figure 2-2). The 1 Refer to Section 4.1 for a detailed discussion of this study.\n\n2 Refer to Section 4.2 for a detailed discussion of this study.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995 sites varied dramatically in climatic and geologic conditions. Contaminants typically were petroleum hydrocarbons from JP-4 jet fuel, heating oils, waste oils, gasoline, and/or diesel; however, some fire training areas also were studied where significant concentrations of solvents were present. This manual is a product of this study and represents the culmination of data collected from these sites and other projects.\n\nIn addition to these studies, other bioventing studies have been conducted by several researchers.\n\nA summary of some sites where bioventing has been applied is shown in\n\nTable 2-2foot_4 . The scale of application and contaminant type is given, as well as the biodegradation rate, if known. The studies listed in Table 2-2 are limited to those where the study was conducted in situ, where no inoculum was added to site soils, and flowrates were optimized for biodegradation, not volatilization. It is important to distinguish between bioventing and SVE systems. Bioventing systems operate at flowrates optimized for biodegradation not volatilization, although some volatilization may occur. SVE systems operate at flowrates optimized for volatilization, although some biodegradation may occur. Therefore, flowrates and configuration of the two systems are significantly different. The following section describes the basic structure for field studies conducted as part of the Bioventing Initiative. Data from these studies were used to generate this two-volume document. 3 Refer to Sections 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, for detailed discussions of these studies. 1 Only select Bioventing Initiative sites are included in this table. A presentation of data from all Bioventing Initiative sites is provided in Section 4.1. September 29, 1995\n\nThe design of the field treatability studies and final bioventing system was developed based on experience at previous studies at Hill, Tyndall, and Eielson AFBs. The Test Plan and Technical Protocol for a Treatability Test for Bioventing (Hinchee et al., 1992) was written to standardize all field methods from treatability tests to well installations. The document allowed for collection of consistent data from 125 sites, which provided a strong database for evaluating bioventing potential. At all sites, the following activities were conducted:\n\n• site characterization, including a small-scale soil gas survey and collection of initial soil and soil gas samples for analysis of BTEX, TPH, and soil physicochemical characteristics;\n\n• field treatability studies, including an in situ respiration test and a soil gas permeability test;\n\n• identification of a background, uncontaminated area for comparison with the contaminated area of background respiration rates and nutrient levels;\n\n• installation of a blower for 1-year of operation (typically configured for air injection), if results of field treatability studies were positive;\n\n• conduct of 6-month and 1-year in situ respiration tests at sites where a blower had been installed; and\n\n• collection of final soil and soil gas samples for analyses of BTEX and TPH.\n\nOf particular significance were the use of the in situ respiration test to measure microbial activity and the use of air injection instead of extraction for air delivery.\n\nThe in situ respiration test was developed to rapidly measure aerobic biodegradation rates in situ at discrete locationsfoot_5 . Biodegradation rates calculated from the in situ respiration test are useful (1) for assessing the potential application of bioremediation at a given site, (2) for estimating the time required for remediation at a given site, and (3) for providing a measurement tool for evaluating the effects of September 29, 1995 various environmental parameters on microbial activity and ultimately on bioventing performance. The actual effect of individual parameters on microbial activity is difficult to assess in the field due to interference and interactions among these parameters. The in situ respiration test integrates all factors to simply assess whether the microorganisms are metabolizing the fuel. Data from the in situ respiration test and site measurements were used to conduct a statistical analysis of the observed effects of the site measurements on microbial activity in the field. The statistical analysis was constructed to account for parameter interactions. These results are discussed in detail in Section 5.0.\n\nAlso of note is that 120 of the 125 bioventing systems installed were configured for air injection.\n\nPrior to the bioventing studies conducted at Hill (Site 280) and Eielson AFBs, bioventing systems typically were operated in the extraction configuration, similar to SVE systems. However, research at Hill and Eielson AFBs demonstrated that air injection is a feasible and more efficient alternative to air extraction, resulting in a greater proportion of hydrocarbon biodegradation rather than volatilization and reduced air emissions 1 . Therefore, the air injection configuration was selected for the basic bioventing system at Bioventing Initiative sites.\n\nThe results generated from the Bioventing Initiative are summarized in detail in Section 5.0 and are used to illustrate the basic principles of bioventing and microbial processes discussed in Section 3.0.\n\nThe design guidelines presented in this manual have culminated primarily from the experience of installing and operating the 125 Bioventing Initiative sites. These design guidelines represent the basic bioventing system, which is applicable to the majority of sites suitable for bioventing. The following section addresses emerging techniques for modifications to the basic bioventing system described in this document for sites that are not amenable to standard bioventing methods.\n\nSeveral techniques are being investigated as a means of modifying the conventional bioventing system described in this document. These techniques have not been tested extensively in the field; therefore, their potential feasibility is unknown. They are briefly presented in this section to illustrate their potential application.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995\n\nThe bioventing modifications being investigated are designed to address specific challenges in bioventing:\n\n• Injection of pure oxygen instead of air for treatment of low-permeability soils. Because only low flowrates are possible in low-permeability soils, injection of pure oxygen may be useful for providing larger oxygen concentrations for a given volume than is possible with air injection.\n\n• Soil warming for bioventing in cold climates. Soil warming can be used to increase biodegradation rates, thus decreasing remediation times. This technique has been studied in detail at Site 20, Eielson AFB, Alaska 1 , but would be an option only in extreme environments.\n\n• Remediation of recalcitrant compounds through ozonation. Ozonation may be used to partially oxidize more recalcitrant contaminants, making them more susceptible to biodegradation. This technique would not be necessary at petroleum-contaminated sites, but may be considered at sites contaminated with compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or pesticides.\n\n• Remediation of contaminated saturated soils through air sparging. Air sparging is being investigated as a means of aerating saturated soil to enhance biodegradation, as well as volatilization. However, studies to date have been inconclusive concerning its effectiveness due to a lack of adequate controls and measurement techniques.\n\nThe techniques described above represent potential future areas of investigation in the bioremediation field. The following chapters describe the principles of bioventing, which also apply to the techniques described in this section.\n\n1 Refer to Section 4.4 for a discussion of this site and the cost benefits of soil warming.\n\nIn this chapter, basic principles fundamental to the bioventing process are discussed to provide a clear understanding of the many physical, chemical, and biological processes that impact the ultimate feasibility of bioventing. Recognizing the significance of these different processes will lead to more efficient bioventing design and operation. Specific topics to be considered in this chapter include:\n\n• soil gas permeability, contaminant diffusion and distribution, and zone of oxygen influence (Section 3.1);\n\n• subsurface distribution of an immiscible liquid (Section 3.1);\n\n• environmental factors which affect microbial processes, such as electron acceptor conditions, moisture content, pH, temperature, nutrient supply, contaminant concentration, and bioavailability (Section 3.2);\n\n• compounds targeted for removal through bioventing (Section 3.3); and\n\n• BTEX versus TPH removal during petroleum bioventing (Section 3.4).\n\nFour primary physical characteristics affect bioventing. These include soil gas permeability, contaminant diffusion in soil, contaminant distribution, and zone of oxygen influence. Each of these parameters is discussed in the following sections\n\nAssuming contaminants are present that are amenable to bioventing, geology probably is the most important site characteristic for a successful bioventing application. Soils must be sufficiently permeable to allow movement of enough soil gas to provide adequate oxygen for biodegradation, on the order of 0.25 to 0.5 pore volumes per day.\n\nSoil gas permeability is a function of both soil structure and particle size, as well as of soil moisture content. Typically, permeability in excess of 0.1 darcy is adequate for sufficient air exchange.\n\nBelow this level, bioventing certainly is possible, but field testing may be required to establish feasibility.\n\nWhen the soil gas permeability falls below approximately 0.01 darcy, soil gas flow is primarily through either secondary porosity (such as fractures) or through any more permeable strata that may be present (such as thin sand lenses). Therefore, the feasibility of bioventing in low permeability soils is a function of the distribution of flow paths and diffusion of air to and from the flow paths within the contaminated area.\n\nIn a soil that is of a reasonable permeability, a minimum separation of 2 to 4 ft (0.61 to 1.2m) between vertical and horizontal flow paths and contaminant may still result in successful treatment due to oxygen diffusion. However, the degree of treatment will be very site-specific.\n\nBioventing has been successful in some low-permeability soils, such as a silty clay site at Fallon Naval Air Station (NAS), Nevada (Kittel et al., 1995), a clayey site at Beale AFB, California (Phelps et al., 1995), a silty site at Eielson AFB, Alaska (Leeson et al., 1995), and a silty clay site in Albemarle County, Virginia (Leeson et al., 1994), and at many Bioventing Initiative sites. Grain size analysis was conducted on several samples from each site in the Bioventing Initiative. The relative distribution of fine-grained soils is illustrated in Figure 3-1. Sufficient soil gas permeability has been demonstrated at many sites with silt and clay contents exceeding 80% by weight. Approximately 50% of the sites tested contained greater than 50% clay and silt fractions. Oxygen distribution has generally been adequate in soils where permeability values exceeded 0.1 darcy, with oxygen detected at ambient levels in all nine of the monitoring points installed. Few sites had permeability less than 0.1 darcy; therefore, data for analysis are limited. The greatest limitation to bioventing at Bioventing Initiative sites has been excessive soil moisture. A combination of high soil moisture content and fine-grained soils has made bioventing impractical at only three of the 125 test sites.\n\nIn general, our calculated soil gas permeability values have exceeded suggested literature values reported in Johnson et al. (1990) for silt and clay soils. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of most soils, which contain lenses of more permeable material or fractures which aid in air distribution.\n\nAnother important factor affecting the feasibility of bioventing is the contaminant distribution throughout the site. Because bioventing is in essence an air delivery system designed to efficiently provide sufficient oxygen to contaminated soils, it is important to have a clear understanding of subsurface contaminant distribution. Many of the sites at which bioventing can be applied are contaminated with immiscible liquids, such as petroleum hydrocarbons. When a fuel release occurs, the contaminants may be present in any or all of four phases in the geologic media:\n\n• sorbed to the soils in the vadose zone;\n\n• in the vapor phase in the vadose zone;\n\n• in free-phase form floating on the water table or as residual saturation in the vadose zone;\n\nand/or\n\n• in the aqueous phase dissolved in pore water in the vadose zone or dissolved in the groundwater.\n\nOf the four phases, dissolved petroleum contaminants in the groundwater frequently are considered to be of greatest concern due to the risk of humans being exposed to contaminants through drinking water. However, the free-phase and sorbed-phase hydrocarbons act as feedstocks for groundwater contamination, so any remedial technology aimed at reducing groundwater contamination must address these sources of contamination. Also, hydrocarbons in the vadose zone can produce a volatile organic carbon (VOC) threat in subsurface buildings or structures.\n\nImmiscible liquids are classified as less dense, nonaqueous-phase liquids (LNAPLs) if their density is less than water or dense, nonaqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs) if their density is greater than water. In general, most petroleum hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, are LNAPLs, whereas most chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), are DNAPLs. Due to these differences in densities, subsurface spills of LNAPLs and DNAPLs will behave differently at a given site, with LNAPLs distributed primarily in the vadose zone and DNAPLs distributed in both the unsaturated and saturated zone. Given that bioventing is primarily a vadose zone treatment process, this discussion will focus on the behavior of LNAPLs.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995\n\nWhen a large enough fuel spill occurs, the fuel is retained within approximately 10 to 20% of the pore volume of the pore volume of the soil and eventually may come to rest on the water table.\n\nContaminants then partition among the various phases existing within the subsurface environment. Fluids can move through the subsurface via various mechanisms, such as advection and diffusion. LNAPLs are likely to migrate through the vadose zone relatively uniformly until the capillary fringe is reached. The LNAPL will then spread laterally along the saturated zone. Water table fluctuation may result in LNAPL below the water table; however, an LNAPL will not permeate the water-saturated zone unless a critical capillary pressure is exceeded, which is a function of the porous medium pore sizes.\n\nIn the vadose zone, components of the LNAPL may partition into the vapor phase or the aqueous phase (pore water), sorb onto solids, or remain in the free product. Contaminants in free product may partition into the vapor phase, depending in their vapor pressures at the temperature and pressure existing in the vadose zone. Once in the vapor phase, these contaminants can migrate in response to advection and diffusion. Raoult's law is used to describe partitioning at equilibrium between an immiscible phase and vapor phase.\n\nWhere: C V = volumetric concentration of the contaminant (X) in the vapor phase (g x /L vapor ); χ = mole fraction of the contaminant (dimensionless); and\n\nC vsat = saturated vapor concentration of the contaminant (g x /L vapor ).\n\nC vsat is defined further as :\n\nT abs = absolute temperature (°K).\n\nFree product in contact with groundwater may leach contaminants into the groundwater or contaminants may dissolve into pore water in the vadose zone, depending on the solubility of specific components. Once in the groundwater, contaminants can migrate through the subsurface in response to a gradient in the aqueous-phase total potential (i.e., advection) or by a difference in the aqueous phase chemical concentrations. The equilibrium relationship between the aqueous and the immiscible phases is described as:\n\nwhere:\n\nC w = volumetric concentration of contaminant x in the aqueous phase (g x /L aqueous ); S X = solubility of pure contaminant x in water (g X /L water ). Sorption of contaminants is a complex process involving several different phenomena including coulomb forces, London-van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, ligand exchange, dipoledipole forces, dipole-induced dipole forces, and hydrophobic forces (Wiedemeier et al., 1995). In the case of hydrocarbons, due to their nonpolar nature, sorption most often occurs through hydrophobic bonding to organic matter. Hydrophobic bonding often is a dominant factor influencing the fate of organic chemicals in the subsurface (DeVinny et al., 1990). The degree of sorption generally is empirically related by the organic content of the soil and by the octanol-water partition coefficient of a particular compound.\n\nSorption isotherms generally follow one of three shapes: Langmuir, Freundlich, or linear (Figure 3-2). The Langmuir isotherm describes the sorbed contaminant concentration as increasing linearly with concentration then leveling off as the number of sites available for sorption are filled. This isotherm accurately describes the situation at or near the contaminant source where concentrations are high. The Freundlich isotherm assumes an infinite number of sorption sites, which would accurately describe an area some distance from the contaminant source where concentrations are dilute. The mathematical expression contains a chemical-specific coefficient that may alter the linearity of the isotherm. The linear isotherm is relatively simple and is valid for dissolved September 29, 1995 compounds at less than one-half of their solubility (Lyman et al., 1992). This isotherm is typically valid to describe hydrocarbon sorption. The linear isotherm is expressed mathematically as:\n\nwhere: C s = quantity of contaminant x sorbed to the solid matrix (g x /g soil );\n\nThe sorption coefficient may be determined experimentally, estimated based on values published in the literature, or estimated using the octanol/water partition coefficient (K ow ) and the organic carbon fraction (f oc ) of the soil. The sorption coefficient can be estimated using the following mathematical expression:\n\nSome values for K ow are provided in Table 3-1. In practice, at equilibrium, the concentration of most petroleum hydrocarbon compounds of interest in the aqueous or vapor phases is driven by the immiscible phase, if present, and the sorbed phase, if the immiscible phase is not present. If no immiscible phase is present, and all sorption sites on the solid soil matrix are not occupiedfoot_7 , the vapor or aqueous phase concentration is a function of the sorbed concentration. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 3-3. This relationship typically follows a Langmuir type curve. If the concentration in the soil is in excess of the sorption capacity of the soilfoot_8 , the aqueous-phase and vapor-phase concentrations are Raoult's law-driven and are independent of the hydrocarbon concentration in the soil. This is an important concept in attempting to interpret soil gas or groundwater data. For example, in a sandy September 29, 1995 site at which free product has been detected, the highest soil hydrocarbon concentrations may exceed 25,000 mg/kg. Yet 99% remediation to 250 mg/kg may not affect the equilibrium soil gas or groundwater hydrocarbon concentrations.\n\nIn terms of contaminant distribution, difficulties in applying bioventing arise when significant quantities of the contaminant are in the capillary fringe or below the water table due to groundwater fluctuations. Treatment of the capillary fringe is possible and screening of venting wells below the water table is recommended to ensure treatment of this area 1 . However, the ability of bioventing to aerate the capillary fringe and underlying water table has not been evaluated. Limited oxygenation is anticipated due to water-filled pore space. If significant contamination exists below the water table, dewatering should be considered as a means of exposing any contaminated soil to injected air. Alternatively, a combination of air sparging and bioventing may provide more efficient air delivery to the capillary fringe; however, air sparging has not been well-documented and many parameters are still unknown concerning its applicability and effectiveness.\n\nAn estimate of the oxygen radius of influence (R I ) of venting wells is an important element of a full-scale bioventing design. This measurement is used to design full-scale systems, specifically to space venting wells, to size blower equipment, and to ensure that the entire site receives a supply of oxygen-rich air to sustain in situ biodegradation.\n\nThe radius of oxygen influence is defined as the radius to which oxygen has to be supplied to sustain maximal biodegradation. This definition of radius of influence is different than is typically used for SVE, where radius of influence is defined as the maximum distance from the air extraction or injection well where vacuum or pressure (soil gas movement) occurs. The oxygen radius of influence is a function of both air flowrates and oxygen utilization rates, and therefore depends on site geology, well design, and microbial activity.\n\nThe radius of influence is a function of soil properties, but also is dependent on the configuration of the venting well, extraction or injection flowrates, and microbial activity, and it is altered by soil stratification. In soils with less-permeable lenses adjacent to more-permeable soils, injection into the permeable layer will produce a greater radius of influence than could be achieved in homogeneous 1 Refer to Section 2.5, Volume II for a discussion of vent well construction.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995 soils. On sites with shallow contamination, the radius of influence also may be increased by impermeable surface barriers such as asphalt or concrete. Frequently, however, paved surfaces do not act as vapor barriers. Without a tight seal to the native soil surfacefoot_9 , the pavement will not significantly impact soil gas flow. Microbial activity will impact the oxygen radius of influence. As microbial activity increases, the effective treated area will decrease. Therefore, it is desirable to estimate the oxygen radius of influence at times of peak microbial activity and to design the bioventing system based on these measurements.\n\nBiological treatment approaches rely on organisms to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants. The advantages of chemical and physical treatment approaches generally are outweighed by the ability of microorganisms to mineralize contaminants, thereby eliminating the process of transferring contaminants from one medium (i.e., soil and soil vapor) into another (i.e., activated carbon) that will still require treatment. In addition, through microbial processes, it is possible to treat large areas relatively inexpensively and with relatively noninvasive techniques. This section discusses kinetics of microbial metabolism and environmental parameters which affect the microbial processes bioventing is dependent upon, thereby potentially affecting the efficacy of bioventing.\n\nIn biological processes, microorganisms degrade organic compounds either directly to obtain carbon and/or energy, or fortuitously in a cometabolic process with no significant benefit to the microorganism. As an example, a stoichiometric equation describing degradation of n-hexane is shown:\n\nIn the case of bioventing, where microorganisms are stimulated in situ, the microorganisms are at equilibrium, and little net biomass growth occurs. In other words, biomass decay approximately balances biomass growth. Consequently, where no net biomass is produced, Equation (3-6) will reduce to:\n\nBased on Equation (3-7), 9.5 moles of oxygen are required for every mole of hydrocarbon consumed, or, on a weight basis, approximately 3.5 g of oxygen are required for every 1 g of hydrocarbon consumed.\n\nTo predict the amount of time required to bioremediate a site, it is necessary to understand the microbial kinetics of substrate (contaminant) utilization. Most substrate utilization falls under the heading of primary substrate utilization, in which growth on a carbon source supplies most of the carbon and energy for the microorganism. In cases where a contaminant does not supply the primary source or cannot be used for carbon and energy, secondary substrate utilization or cometabolism may occur. During the bioventing process, primary substrate utilization generally describes the kinetics of the reactions taking place; however, in some instances, cometabolic processes also may occur. For example, at sites contaminated with both fuels and solvents such as TCE, cometabolic bioventing may account for degradation of TCE.\n\nPrimary substrate utilization has been described through an empirical approach by the Monod expression:\n\nSeptember 29, 1995 K S = Monod half-velocity constant (g S /L).\n\nAt high substrate concentrations (S > > K S ), the rate of substrate utilization is at a maximum, limited by some other factor such as oxygen, nutrients, or the characteristics of the microorganism. In this instance, the rate of substrate utilization will be first-order with respect to cell density, but zero-order with respect to substrate concentration. Conversely, when the primary substrate concentration is very low (S < < K S ), the substrate utilization rate will be first-order with respect to both cell density and substrate concentration. In a well-designed bioventing system, kinetics based on oxygen utilization are zero-order.\n\nHowever, the rate based on petroleum or other contaminant removal may be described by Monod or inhibition kinetics.\n\nMonod kinetics have been widely applied to conventional wastewater treatment where the compounds being treated generally are bioavailable and readily degradable. Bioventing typically is applied to aerobically biodegradable compounds; however, the maximum rate of biodegradation (k) is much lower than for most wastes in conventional wastewater treatment. For example, Howard et al.\n\n(1991) estimated that benzene has an aerobic half-life (dissolved in groundwater) of 10 days to 24 months, whereas ethanol (a compound more typical of conventional wastewater treatment) is estimated to have a half-life of 0.5 to 2.2 days. Bioventing kinetics are further complicated by bioavailability of the contaminants, driven at least in part by solubilization. Since microorganisms exist in pore water, contaminants must partition into the pore water to be available to be degraded. Although high soil contaminant concentrations may be present, the actual concentration of hydrocarbon dissolved in the pore water and available to the microorganisrns may be low.\n\nIn practice, oxygen utilization rates tend to decline slowly with time during remediation. At many sites, this trend may be difficult to follow over periods of less than 1 to 3 years because of other variables affecting the rate, such as temperature and soil moisture. This decline may not be indicative of true first-order kinetics, but simply may be the result of selective early removal of more degradable compounds such as benzene.\n\nBioventing is dependent upon providing microorganisms optimal conditions for active growth.\n\nSeveral factors may affect a microorganism's ability to degrade contaminants, including:\n\n• availability and type of electron acceptors;\n\n• moisture content;\n\n• soil pH;\n\n• soil temperature;\n\n• nutrient availability; and\n\n• contaminant concentration.\n\nEach of these parameters was measured at Bioventing Initiative sites. The actual effect of individual parameters on microbial activity is difficult to assess in the field due to interference and interactions among these parameters. The in situ respiration test was used as a measurement tool that integrates all factors to assess whether the microorganisms are metabolizing the fuel. Data from the in situ respiration test and site measurements were used to conduct a statistical analyses of the observed effects of the site measurements on microbial activity in the field. The statistical analysis was constructed to account for parameter interactions. These results are discussed in detail in Section 5.0. A more general discussion of the significance of each of these parameters and its affect on microbial activity is provided in Sections 3.3.2.1 through 3.3.2.7.\n\nOne of the most important factors which influences the biodegradability of a compound is the type and availability of electron acceptors. For example, following a hydrocarbon spill, as a result of the hydrocarbon biodegradability, anaerobic conditions typically predominate in the subsurface because of oxygen depletion from microbial activity. While hydrocarbons may undergo limited biodegradation under anaerobic conditions (Bilbo et al., 1992;Mormile et al., 1994), in general, aerobic conditions are most suitable for relatively rapid remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Therefore, oxygen supply is critical to the success of a bioventing system. In field studies, oxygen has been found to be the most important factor in determining the success of a bioventing system (Hinchee et al., 1989;Miller et al., 1991). This has been confirmed by the Bioventing Initiative. At these sites, oxygen has been found to the primary factor limiting microbial activity at all but three sites (Miller et al., 1993).\n\nSeptember 29, 1995\n\nSoil moisture content may impact the bioventing process by its affect on microorganisms or soil gas permeability. Microorganisms require moisture for metabolic processes and for solubilization of energy and nutrient supplies. Conversely, soil moisture content directly affects the soil permeability, with high moisture contents resulting in poor distribution of oxygen. In practice, soil moisture has been found\n\nto directly limit biodegradation rates only where bioventing has been implemented in very dry desert environments. A more common influence of moisture is that excess moisture has led to significant reductions in soil gas permeability. One of the major objectives of the Bioventing Initiative was to assess the effects of moisture on biodegradation.\n\nThe range of soil moisture content measured at Bioventing Initiative sites is shown in Figure 34.\n\nThe lowest soil moisture content measured was 2% by weight, and microbial activity still was observed in these soils. Figure 3-5 illustrates the observed relationship between soil moisture and oxygen utilization rates. To date, a strong correlation has not been recorded between moisture content and oxygen utilization rate, although a slight positive relationship has been observedfoot_10 .\n\nAt a desert site at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twenty-nine Palms, California, soil moisture content appeared to detrimentally affect microbial activity. Soil moisture content ranged from 2 % to 4 % by weight and, although the site was contaminated with jet fuel, significant oxygen limitation was not observed. An irrigation system was installed at the site in an effort to enhance microbial activity. The site was irrigated for 1 week, then bioventing was initiated for 1 month before conducting an in situ respiration test. In situ respiration rates measured after irrigation were significantly higher than those measured prior to irrigation (Figure 3456). In addition, prior to irrigation, oxygen was not consumed below approximately 17% before microbial activity stopped. After irrigation, activity continued until oxygen was completely consumed to less than 1%. These results demonstrated that, in extreme cases, moisture addition may improve the performance of bioventing systems through enhanced microbial activity.\n\nIt may be assumed that air injection bioventing will dry out the soil to a point what would be detrimental to microbial growth, necessitating humidification of the injection air. However, a simple calculation as shown in Example 3-1 illustrates that over a 3-year period, moisture loss is minimal.\n\nDrying and moisture loss as a result of bioventing usually are a problem only very near the vent well or if very high air injection rates are used (typically no the case in properly designed bioventing systems).\n\nSites typically have several moisture sources that also make drying due to air injection negligible, such as rain and snow, and water as a byproduct of mineralization (generated at a rate of 1.5 kg water for every 1 kg of hydrocarbon degraded 1 ).\n\n1 Refer to Equation (3-7) for the stoichiometry of this calculation.\n\nSoil pH also may affect the bioremediation process, since microorganisms require a specific pH range in order to survive. Most bacteria function best in a pH range between 5 and 9 with the optimum being slightly above 7 (Dragun, 1988). A shift in pH may result in a shift in the makeup of the microbial population, because each species will exhibit optimal growth at a specific pH. Throughout the Bioventing Initiative, pH has not been found to limit in situ bioremediation, and is probably only of concern where contamination has radically altered the existing pH.\n\nFigure 3-7 illustrates the range of soil pH found at the Bioventing Initiative sites to date. In general, the majority of sites have fallen within the \"optimal\" pH range for microbial activity of 5 to 9.\n\nHowever, microbial respiration based on oxygen utilization has been observed at all sites, even in soils where the pH was below 5 or above 9. Figure3-8 illustrates the observed relationship between pH and oxygen utilization rates. Based upon these observations, it appears that pH is not a concern when bioventing at most sitesfoot_11 .\n\nSoil temperature may significantly affect the bioremediation process. Microbial activity has been reported at temperatures varying from -12 to 100°C (10 to 212°F) (Brock et al., 1984); however, the optimal range for biodegradation of most contaminants is generally much narrower. An individual microorganism may tolerate a temperature peak of up to approximately 40°C (104°F). However, a microorganism's optimal growth temperature will vary depending on climate. For example, microorganisms in a subarctic environment may exhibit optimal growth at 10°C (50°F), whereas microorganisms in a subtropical environment may exhibit optimal growth at 30°C (86°F).\n\nIt has generally been observed that biodegradation rates double for every 10°C (50°F)\n\ntemperature increase, up to some inhibitory temperature. The van't Hoff-Arrhenius equation expresses this relationship quantitatively as:\n\nSeptember 29, 1995\n\nHeat addition may improve bioventing processes. Solar warming, warm water infiltration, and buried heat tape have been used to increase soil temperature. Their use has resulted in increased microbial activity and contaminant degradation (Leeson et al., 1995). Selection of a soil warming technique will depend on cost considerations versus remediation time requirementsfoot_12 . While warm water infiltration or heat tape can significantly increase biodegradation rates, the cost is significantly higher than simply using surface insulation or no heating method. The use of warm water infiltration, although effective, is limited to very permeable soils, to ensure that adequate drainage of the applied water will occur. The use of soil heating to increase biodegradation rates may prove cost effective only in cold regions, such as Alaska.\n\nIn order to sustain microbial growth, certain nutrients must be available at minimum levels. The following nutrients/cofactors are known to be required in order to support microbial growth: calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulfur, and zinc. Nitrogen and phosphorus are required in the greatest concentrations and are the nutrients most likely to be limiting. The remaining chemicals are considered micronutrients, because they are required in only small quantities and generally are available in excess in nature.\n\nNutrients are required as components of the microbial biomass. The need for these nutrients is very different from the need for oxygen (or other electron donors) and the carbon source.\n\nNutrients are not destroyed, but are recycled by the ecosystem. Thus, like oxygen, a steady input of nutrients is not required.\n\nAn approach to estimation of nutrient requirements, suggested by John T. Wilson of the U.S. EPA Ada Laboratory, can be made based on microbial kinetics. Starting with:\n\nLittle is known about the in situ cell yields or endogenous respiration rates of hydrocarbon-degrading organisms, but these parameters can be estimated based on ranges reported in the wastewater treatment literature (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979). An example for calculating required nutrients is shown in Example 3-3. Therefore, although the addition of nutrients may be desirable in hopes of increasing biodegradation rates, field research to date does not indicate the need for these additions (Dupont et al., 1991;Miller et al., 1991). Therefore, although nutrients are often added to bioremediation projects in anticipation of increased biodegradation rates, field data to date do not show a clear relationship between increased rates and supplied nutrients.\n\nConcentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus at the Bioventing Initiative sites and the corresponding relationship between oxygen utilization rates are shown in Figures 3-10 through 3-13. Although optimal ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were not available at all sites, the natural nutrient levels were sufficient to sustain some level of biological respiration at all sites when the most limiting element, oxygen, was provided.\n\nIn controlled nutrient additions at Tyndall and Hill AFBs 1 , no apparent increase in microbial activity was observed. Therefore, there appeared to be no benefit of nutrient addition. The relationship between oxygen utilization rates and TKN and total phosphorus are shown in Figures 3-11 and 3-13, respectively. As is illustrated in these figures, there is no correlation between phosphorus and oxygen utilization rates and only a weak relationship between TKN concentrations 1 Refer to Sections 4.1 and 4.2 for detailed discussions of these sites.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995 and oxygen utilization rates, again emphasizing that natural ambient nutrient levels seem sufficient for microbial activity 1 .\n\nFigure 3-14 illustrates the range of iron concentrations measured at Bioventing Initiative sites. Iron concentrations varied greatly, with concentrations from less than 100 mg/kg to greater than 75,000 mg/kg. Soils in Hawaii and Alaska exhibited the highest iron contents. Although iron is a nutrient required for microbial growth, iron also may react with oxygen to form iron oxides. Theoretically, if a significant amount of iron oxidation occurs, the observed oxygen utilization rate 2 would not reflect microbial activity only. Therefore, calculated biodegradation rates would be an overestimate of actual biodegradation rates.\n\nThus, background wells in uncontaminated areas are recommended in bioventing applications in areas of high iron concentrations. To date, this study has shown no correlation between iron content and oxygen utilization rates (Figure 3-15).\n\nContaminant concentration also may affect biodegradation of the contaminant itself. Excessive quantities of a contaminant can result in a reduction in biodegradation rate due to a toxicity effect.\n\nConversely, very low concentrations of a contaminant also may reduce overall degradation rates because contact between the contaminant and the microorganism is limited and the substrate concentration is likely below S min .\n\nIn practice, petroleum hydrocarbons in fuel mixtures do not generally appear to be toxic to the bioventing process. Other more soluble (i.e., phenolics) or less biodegradable compounds (i.e., TCE) may exhibit a toxicity effect and it has been reported that pure benzene may be toxic. Although a general relationship between bioventing rates and concentration no doubt exists, the relationship is complex and not fully understood. At sites where NAPLs are present (soil concentrations above the 100 to 1,000 mg/kg range), the bioavailable hydrocarbon is most probably limited by solubilization, which is linked to Raoult's law and, to an extent, is independent of total hydrocarbon concentration. Certainly, the NAPL distribution can affect the proportion of the soil in a site in which biodegradation 1 Refer to Section 5.2 for a discussion of the statistical relationship between nutrients and oxygen utilization rates. 2 As measured by in situ soil gas oxygen concentrations. is occurring, and at lower concentrations less soil may be in direct contact with NAPLs. It is likely that the reduction in biodegradation rates observed over time on many sites is due at least in part to changes in the hydrocarbon makeup as the more degradable and more mobile compounds (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) are removed. At lower hydrocarbon concentrations where NAPLs are not present, a decline in rate would be expected with time as the available substrate is removed.\n\nAnother critical parameter affecting the extent of in situ bioremediation is bioavailability of the contaminant(s) of concern. Bioavailability is a general term to describe the accessibility of contaminants to the degrading populations. Bioavailability consists of (1) a physical aspect related to phase distribution and mass transfer, and (2) a physiological aspect related to the suitability of the contaminant as a substrate (U.S. EPA, 1993, EPA/540/S-93i501). Compounds with greater aqueous solubilities and lower affinities to partition into NAPL or to sorb onto the soil generally are bioavailable to soil microorganisms and are more readily degraded. For example, BTEX is preferentially degraded relative to the larger alkanes found in fuels. The most likely explanation for this is that BTEX is more mobile and more soluble in pore water and therefore is more bioavailable.\n\nAny aerobically biodegradable compound, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, potentially can be degraded though bioventing. To date, bioventing has been applied primarily to petroleum hydrocarbons (Table 2-2); however, bioventing of PAHs (Lund et al., 1991;Hinchee and Ong, 1992;Alleman et al., 1995) and bioventing applied to an acetone, toluene, and naphthalene mixture (Leeson et al., 1994) have been implemented successfully.\n\nThe key to bioventing feasibility in most applications is biodegradability versus volatility of the compound. If the rate of volatilization greatly exceeds the rate of biodegradation, bioventing is unlikely to be successful, as removal occurs primarily through volatilization. This will occur most often in those cases where the contaminant is a fresh, highly volatile fuel. An unsuccessful bioventing application is unlikely to occur due to a lack of microbial activity. If bioventing is operated in the injection mode as recommended by this manual, volatilized contaminants may be biodegraded before reaching the surface, unlike during an extraction operationfoot_13 . Figure 3-16 illustrates the relationship between a compound's physicochemical properties and its potential for bioventing.\n\nIn general, compounds with a low vapor pressure 2 cannot be successfully removed by volatilization, but can be biodegraded in a bioventing application if they are aerobically biodegradable.\n\nHigh vapor pressure compounds are gases at ambient temperatures. These compounds volatilize too rapidly to be easily biodegraded in a bioventing system, but typically are a small component of fuels and, due to their high volatility, will attenuate rapidly. Compounds with vapor pressures between l and 760 mm Hg may be amenable to either volatilization or biodegradation.\n\nWithin this intermediate range lie many of the petroleum hydrocarbon compounds of greatest regulatory interest, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes. As can be seen in Figure 3-16, various petroleum fuels are more or less amenable to bioventing. Some components of gasoline are too volatile to easily biodegrade, but, as stated previously, typically are present in low overall concentrations and are attenuated rapidly. Most of the diesel constituents are sufficiently nonvolatile to preclude volatilization, whereas the constituents of JP-4 jet fuel are intermediate in volatility.\n\nTo be amenable to bioventing, a compound must (l) biodegrade aerobically at a rate resulting in an oxygen demand greater than the rate of oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere, and (2) biodegrade at a sufficiently high rate to allow in situ biodegradation before volatilization. Practically, this means that low vapor pressure compounds need not biodegrade as rapidly as high vapor pressure compounds for bioventing to be successful. Figure 3-17 illustrates this relationship. The actual feasibility of bioventing is very site-specific and Figures 3-16 and 3-17 should not be used as absolutes, but rather as general guidelines.\n\nBioventing generally is not considered appropriate for treating compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. However, through a cometabolic process, it may be possible to enhance the degradation of compounds such as TCE through September 29, 1995 bioventing. In laboratory studies, it has been shown that if toluene is present to provide the primary source of carbon, organisms that grow on toluene may be able to cometabolize TCE (Wackett and Gibson, 1992). More recently, Hopkins et al. (1993) demonstrated TCE degradation in situ through the injection of oxygen and phenol into an aquifer. TCE removal of 88 % was observed in the field indicating the potential for cometabolic degradation of chlorinated compounds in situ.\n\nBTEX generally are the compounds that are regulated most stringently. Typically, these compounds degrade very rapidly during bioventing, and at most sites, are degraded to below detection limits within 1 year of operation of a bioventing system. This trend was illustrated in a study at Tyndall AFBfoot_15 and has been confirmed at 81 sites completing the 1-year testing under the Bioventing Initiative. At Tyndall AFB, two test plots were studied with initial hydrocarbon concentrations of 5,100 and 7,700 mg/kg. After 9 months of bioventing, TPH was reduced by 40% from the initial concentration. However, the low-molecular-weight compounds such as BTEX were reduced by more than 90% (Figure 3-18). The low-molecular-weight compounds were preferentially degraded over the heavier fuel components, which is consistent with previous research (Atlas, 1986).\n\nIf a risk-based approach to remediation is used that focuses on removing the soluble, mobile, and more toxic BTEX components of the fuel, remediation times can be reduced significantly, making bioventing an attractive technology for risk-based remediations. In addition, the BTEX compounds often are initially at relatively low levels at many fuel-contaminated sites as illustrated by results from the Bioventing Initiative. Data collected from the majority of the Bioventing Initiative sites demonstrate that more than 85 % of initial soil samples contained less than 1 mg/kg of benzene (Figure 345678910111213141516171819). An exception to this may be gasoline-contaminated sites; the majority of sites included in the Bioventing Initiative were contaminated with heavier weight contaminants. Only 19 of 125 Bioventing Initiative sites were contaminated by gasoline or AVGAS.\n\nFour of the first well-documented bioventing studies are presented in this section to illustrate significant results which have contributed to the development of bioventing, the Bioventing Initiative, and this document. The development of the Bioventing Initiative was based largely upon the results from these four early studies, which are discussed in detail in this section. Site 914, Hill AFB, Utah, was one of the first bioventing systems studied. This study was designed to examine the feasibility of biodegradation through air injection, and also to investigate the effect of nutrient and moisture addition on biodegradation. The second site was a bioventing system at Tyndall AFB, Florida, initiated in 1990. This study was short-term (9 months), but was designed to examine process variables in more detail than was possible at Site 914, Hill AFB. The third site discussed in this chapter was conducted at Site 280, Hill AFB, Utah. This study was initiated in 1991 as a bioventing site and was operated for approximately 3 years. Research on air flowrates and injection depth was carried out at this site. The fourth study presented in this chapter was conducted at Eielson AFB, Alaska. This study was initiated in 1991 as a bioventing system and was operated for 3 years. This study was conducted to examine the feasibility of bioventing in a subarctic climate as well as to evaluate the effects of soil warming on biodegradation rates.\n\nA case history of the Fire Training Area, Battle Creek Air National Guard Base (ANGB) also is presented in this chapter. This site was included in the Bioventing Initiative, but additional samples were collected at the end of the 1-year study as part of a separate project. The results from this study illustrate typical installations and results from a Bioventing Initiative site, and provide additional data on BTEX contamination after 1 year of bioventing. These case histories are not presented as design examples, because they were designed as research efforts. In fact, these studies have been the basis for development of current design practice as presented in Volume II of this document. Details of each of these studies are presented in the following sections.\n\nA spill of approximately 27,000 gallons of JP-4 jet fuel occurred at Site 914 when an automatic overflow device failed. Contamination was limited to the upper 65 ft (20 m) of a delta outwash of the Weber River. This surficial formation extends from the surface to a depth of approximately 65 ft (20 m) and is composed of mixed sand and gravel with occasional clay stringers. Depth to regional groundwater is approximately 600 ft (180 m); however, water occasionally may be found in discontinuous perched zones. Soil moisture averaged less than 6% by weight in the contaminated soils.\n\nThe collected soil samples had JP-4 jet fuel concentrations up to 20,000 mg/kg, with an average concentration of approximately 400 mg/kg (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1989). Contaminants were unevenly distributed to depths of 65 ft (20 m). Vent wells were drilled to approximately 65 ft (20 m) below the ground surface and were screened from 10 to 60 ft (3 to 20 m) below the surface. A background vent well was installed in an uncontaminated location in the same geologic formation approximately 700 ft (210 m) north of the site.\n\nThis system originally was designed for SVE, not for bioventing. During the initial 9 months of operation, it was operated to optimize volatilization, while biodegradation was merely observed. After this period, air flowrates were greatly reduced, and an effort was made to optimize biodegradation and limit volatilization.\n\nSoil vapor extraction was initiated in December 1988 at a rate of approximately 25 cubic ft per minute (cfm) (710 L/min). The off-gas was treated by catalytic incineration, and initially it was necessary to dilute the highly concentrated gas to remain below explosive limits and within the incinerator's hydrocarbon operating limits. The venting rate was gradually increased to approximately 1,500 cfm (4.2 x 104 L/min) as hydrocarbon concentrations dropped. During the period between December 1988 and November 1989, more than 3.5 x 108 ft3 (9.9 x 10 l ° L) of soil gas were extracted from the site.\n\nIn November 1989, ventilation rates were reduced to between approximately 300 and 600 cfm (8,500 to 17,000 L/min) to provide aeration for bioremediation while reducing off-gas generation. This change allowed removal of the catalytic incinerators, saving approximately $13,000 per month in rental and propane costs. Hinchee and Arthur (1991) conducted bench-scale studies using soils from this site and found that, in the laboratory, both moisture and nutrients appeared to become limiting after aerobic conditions had been achieved. These findings led to the addition of first moisture and then nutrients in the field.\n\nMoisture addition clearly stimulated biodegradation, whereas nutrient addition did not (Figure 4-1). The failure to observe an effect of nutrient addition could be explained by a number of factors:\n\n1. The nutrients failed to move in the soils, which is a problem particularly for ammonia and phosphorus (Aggarwal et al., 1991).\n\n2. Remediation of the site was entering its final phase and nutrient addition may have been too late to result in an observed change.\n\n3. Nutrients simply may have not been limiting.\n\nDuring extraction, oxygen and hydrocarbon concentrations in the off-gas were measured. To quantify the extent of biodegradation at the site, the oxygen was converted to an equivalent basis. This was based on the stoichiometric oxygen requirement for hexane mineralizationfoot_16 . Hydrocarbon concentrations were determined based on direct readings of a total hydrocarbon analyzer calibrated to hexane. Based on these calculations, the mass of JP-4 jet fuel as carbon removed was approximately 1,500 pounds volatilized and 93,000 pounds biodegraded (Figure =1). After a 2-year period, cleanup and regulatory closure were achieved (Figure 4-2).\n\nThe results of this study indicated that aerobic biodegradation of JP-4 jet fuel did occur in the vadose zone at Site 914. Biodegradation was increased by soil venting at this site because, prior to venting, biodegradation appeared to have been oxygen limited. The SVE system, designed to volatilize the fuel, stimulated in situ biodegradation with no added nutrients or moisture. In this study, approximately 15% of the documented field removal observed at the site was the result of microbial-mediated mineralization to carbon dioxide. Additional biological fuel removal by conversion to biomass and degradation products no doubt occurred, but was not quantified.\n\nFrom this study, it was apparent that further studies of field biodegradation in unsaturated soils were needed to develop a better understanding of the effects of such variables as oxygen content, nutrient requirements, soil moisture, contaminant levels, and soil type on the limitation and optimization of bioventing of contaminated field sites. Also, further studies of gas transport in the vadose zone were needed to ensure adequate design of air delivery systems.\n\nFurther details of this study may be found in Dupont et al. (1991) and Hinchee et al. (199lb).\n\nA more controlled study than was possible at Site 914, Hill AFB was designed at Tyndall AFB as a follow-up to the Hill AFB research. The experimental area in the Tyndall AFB study was located at a site where past JP-4 jet fuel storage had resulted in contaminated soils. The nature and volume of fuel spilled or leaked were unknown. The site soils were a fine-to medium-grained quartz sand. The depth to groundwater was 2 to 4 ft (0.61 to 1.2 m).\n\nThe field study was designed with the following objectives:\n\n• to determine whether bioventing enhanced biodegradation of JP-4 jet fuel at this site;\n\n• to determine whether moisture addition coupled with bioventing enhanced biodegradation rates;\n\n• to determine whether nutrient addition coupled with bioventing enhanced biodegradation rates;\n\n• to evaluate flowrate manipulation to maximize biodegradation and minimize volatilization; and\n\n• to calculate specific biodegradation rate constants from a series of respiration tests conducted during shutdown of the air extraction system.\n\nFour test cells were constructed to allow control of gas flow, water flow, and nutrient addition.\n\nTest cells V1 and V2 were installed in the hydrocarbon-contaminated zone; test cells V3 and V4 were installed in uncontaminated soils. Test cells were constructed and operated in the following manner:\n\n• V1 (uncontaminated): Venting for approximately 8 weeks, followed by moisture addition for approximately 14 weeks, followed by moisture and nutrient addition for approximately 7 weeks.\n\n• V2 (uncontaminated): Venting coupled with moisture and nutrient addition for 29 weeks.\n\n• V3 (uncontaminated): Venting with moisture and nutrient addition at rates similar to V2, with injection of hydrocarbon-contaminated off-gas from V1. Operation was conducted at a series of flowrates and retention times.\n\n• V4 (uncontaminated): Venting with moisture and nutrient addition at rates similar to V2.\n\nInitial site characterization indicated the mean soil hydrocarbon levels were 5,100 and 7,700 mg of hexane-equivalent/kg in treatment plots V1 and V2, respectively. The contaminated area was dewatered, and hydraulic control was maintained to keep the depth to water at approximately 5.25 ft (1.6 m). This exposed more of the contaminated soil to aeration. During normal operation, air flowrates were maintained at approximately one air-filled void volume per day.\n\nBiodegradation and volatilization rates were much higher at the Tyndall AFB site than those observed at Hill AFB. These higher rates were likely due to higher average levels of contamination, higher temperatures, and higher moisture content. Biodegradation rates during bioventing ranged from approximately 2 to 20 mg/kg-day, with average values of 5 mg/kg-day. After 200 days of aeration, an average hydrocarbon reduction of approximately 2,900 mg/kg was observed. This represented a reduction in total hydrocarbons of approximately 40%.\n\nAnother important observation of this study was the effect of temperature on the biodegradation rate. Miller (1990) found that the van't Hoff-Arrhenius equation provided an excellent model of temperature effects. In the Tyndall AFB study, soil temperature varied by only approximately 7°C (44.6°F), yet biodegradation rates were approximately twice as high at 25°C (77°F) than at 18°C (64.4°F).\n\nOperational data and biodegradation rates indicated that soil moisture and nutrients were not limiting factors in hydrocarbon biodegradation for this site (Figure 4-3). The lack of moisture effect contrasts with the Hill AFB findings, but most likely is the result of contrasting climatic and hydrogeologic conditions. Hill AFB is located in a high-elevation desert with a very deep water table.\n\nTyndall AFB is located in a moist, subtropical environment, and at the site studies, the water table was maintained at a depth of approximately 5.25 ft (1.6 m). The nutrient findings support field observations at Hill AFB that the addition of nutrients does not stimulate biodegradation. Based on acetylene reduction studies, Miller (1990) speculated that adequate nitrogen was present due to nitrogen fixation. Both the Hill and Tyndall AFB sites had been contaminated for several years before the bioventing studies began, and both sites were anaerobic. It is possible that nitrogen fixation, which is maximized under these conditions, provided the required nutrients. In any case, these findings show that nutrient addition is not always required.\n\nIn the Tyndall AFB study, a careful evaluation of the relationship between air flowrates and biodegradation and volatilization was made. It was found that extracting air at the optimal rate for biodegradation resulted in 90% removal by biodegradation and 10% removal by volatilization. It was also found that passing the contaminants volatilized in the off-gas through clean soil resulted in complete biodegradation of the volatilized vapors.\n\nIn situ respiration tests documented that oxygen consumption rates followed zero-order kinetics and that rates were linear down to 2 to 4% oxygen. Therefore, air flowrates can be minimized to maintain oxygen levels between 2 and 4% without inhibiting biodegradation of fuel, with the added benefit that lower air flowrates will increase the percent of removal by biodegradation and decrease the percent of removal by volatilization.\n\nThe study was terminated because the process monitoring objectives had been met; biodegradation was still vigorous. Although the TPH had been reduced by only 40% by the time of study termination, the low-molecular-weight aromatics-the BTEX components-were reduced by more than 90% (Figure 3-18). It appeared that the bioventing process more rapidly removed the BTEX compounds than the other JP-4 fuel constituents.\n\nResults from this study demonstrated the effectiveness of bioventing for remediating fuelcontaminated soils, the ineffectiveness of moisture or nutrient addition for increasing in situ biodegradation rates, and the importance of air flowrates for optimizing biodegradation over volatilization. However, it was evident from this study that a long-term bioventing study was necessary to examine process variables. This led to the initiation of the Site 280, Hill AFB and the Site 20, Eielson AFB projects described in the following sections.\n\nFurther details of the Tyndall AFB study may be found in Miller (1990) and Miller et al. (1991).\n\nA key objective of the study at Site 280 was to optimize the injection air flowrates. These efforts were intended to maximize biodegradation rates in JP-4 jet fuel-contaminated soils while minimizing or eliminating volatilization. The site studied was a JP-4 jet fuel spill at Hill AFB that had existed since sometime in the 1940s (Figure 4-4). The geology was similar to that of Site 914, but the average contaminant levels were slightly higher (Figure 4-5). Vent wells were installed to a depth of approximately 110 ft and groundwater was at a depth of approximately 100 ft.\n\nFrom November 1992 through January 1995, a number of studies were conducted to evaluate low-intensity bioremediation at Site 280. These efforts included (1) varying the air injection flowrates in conjunction with in situ respiration tests, and (2) surface emissions testing to provide information for system optimization.\n\nFive air flowrate evaluations were conducted at Site 280 from 1991 through 1994 (28, 67, 67, 40, and 117 cfm [790, 1,900, 1,900, 1,100, and 3,300 L/min]). Each evaluation was followed by in situ respiration testing. The 67 cfm (1,900 L/min) study was repeated to include additional soil gas monitoring points added to the site. Monthly soil gas monitoring was conducted at Site 280 to measure the concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and TPH at each sampling point following system operation at each of the different air flowrates.\n\nSurface emissions tests were conducted during each air injection test and while the air injection system was turned off. In each of the surface emissions tests, no significant differences were found between the periods of air injection and no air injection. TPH soil gas levels measured during the air injection periods averaged approximately 70 ppmv, while TPH soil gas levels during resting periods averaged 42 ppmv. These averages were not found to be statistically different. Likewise, surface emissions rates were not significantly different at different flowrates. concentrations decreased at all depths within the 25-ft radius from the vent well, with the exception of the samples collected at a depth of 90 to 100 ft. Samples taken from this depth are located at the capillary fringe, and it is likely that adequate aeration was not possible at that location. Samples collected beyond the 25-ft radius were less conclusive, indicating that this area was not aerated.\n\nFurther details of the Site 280, Hill AFB study may be found in Sayles et al. (1994b).\n\nThe objective of the Eielson AFB study was to install and operate an in situ soil bioremediation system to investigate the feasibility of using bioventing to remediate JP-4 jet fuel contamination in a subarctic environment and to actively increase soil temperature to determine to what degree increased soil temperature can enhance the biodegradation rates of JP-4 contaminants in soil. This study comprised four test plots: (1) one in which heated groundwater was circulated through the test plot (active warming test plot); (2) one in which plastic sheeting was placed over the ground surface of the test plot during the spring and summer months to capture solar heat and passively warm the soil (passive warming test plot); (3) one in which heat tape was installed in the test plot to heat the soil directly (surface warming test plot); and (4) a control test plot, which received air injection but no soil warming (control test plot). In addition, an uncontaminated background location also received air injection but no soil warming to monitor natural background respiration rates. The site soils were a sandy silt, with increasing amounts of sand and gravel with depth. Groundwater was typically at approximately the 7-ft depth.\n\nFigure 4-8 illustrates site geologic features and typical construction details of site installations.\n\nDifferences in soil temperatures were significant among the four test plots (Figure 456789). When in operation, the active warming test plot consistently maintained higher temperatures than the other test plots during the winter months. In the passive warming test plot, plastic sheeting increased soil temperature, with average soil temperatures as high at 18°C (64.4°F) during the summer months, compared to average temperatures of approximately 10°C (50°F) in the control test plot. A significant feature of this soil warming technique was that the addition of plastic sheeting in the spring caused a rapid increase in soil temperature, nearly 6 to 8 weeks sooner than in the unheated test plots. The early heating significantly increased the period of rapid microbial degradation. During the winter months, the passive warming test plot remained warmer than the control test plot.\n\nRespiration rates were measured quarterly in each test plot. Of particular interest were rates measured in the control test plot. It was expected that no substantial microbial activity would occur during the winter months in unheated test plots due to the extreme temperatures. However, significant microbial activity was consistently measured in the control test plot, even at soil temperatures just below freezing (Figure 4-10). Respiration rates in the passive warming test plot were observed to increase nearly one order of magnitude as soil temperature increased during the summer months, indicating the success of the use of plastic sheeting to promote soil warming (Figure 4-10). Respiration rates measured in the active warming test plot were higher than those measured in the passive warming or control test plot when warm water circulation was operating. Warm water circulation was discontinued in fall 1993, and as the soil temperature dropped, no significant microbial activity could be measured in the test plot during winter months. This phenomenon is interesting in that it suggests that during the 2 years of soil heating, microorganisms adapted to growth at higher temperatures, yet lost the ability to remain active in colder soils. In order to determine whether the microbial population could adapt to cold temperatures given time, a final in situ respiration test was conducted in January 1995. Significant microbial activity was measured, comparable to the control test plot, indicating either readaptation or recolonization by the microbial population.\n\nThe surface warming test plot has shown promise as a form of soil warming. Soil temperatures and respiration rates were higher than temperatures or rates in either the passive warming or control test plot and were similar to those measured in the active warming test plot during warm water circulation.\n\nThese results indicate that the use of heat tape may prove to be a more efficient means of soil warming than hot water circulation, because the problem of high soil moisture content is avoided.\n\nAn evaluation of cost versus remediation time was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of soil warming. Costs for the basic bioventing system in Table 4-1 were based on costs calculated by Downey et al. (1994). Given that average biodegradation rates were higher in the actively warmed plots, overall remediation time would be more rapid than in the unheated test plots (Table 4-1). Although capital costs were higher in the active and surface warming test plots, the rapid remediation time results in lower total costs for power and monitoring. Final costs based on $/yd 3 bioremediated illustrate that costs are comparable between the four treatment cells. These results indicate that implementation of a soil warming technology over basic bioventing is not necessarily based on cost, but on desired remediation time and funds available for operation and maintenance relative to capital costs.\n\nFinal soil sampling at this site was conducted in August 1994. Results of initial and final BTEX and TPH samples are shown in Figure 4-11 and 4-12, respectively. A dramatic reduction in BTEX was observed at all sample locations, while TPH on average was reduced by approximately 60%.\n\nSpatial variability in contaminant distribution and biodegradation rates makes quantitative comparison between the test plots difficult; however, the results from the active, surface, and passive warning test plots clearly demonstrate that these forms of soil warming have increased biological activity in these areas. In the active and surface warming test plot, despite problems due to high soil moisture content, biodegradation rates consistently have been higher than those measured in either the passive warming or the control test plot, even though the control test plot appears to be more heavily contaminated than the active warming test plot. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of bioventing in a subarctic climate and the potential advantages of soil warming to accelerate remediation.\n\nFurther details of the Site 20, Eielson AFB study may be found in Leeson et al. (1995) and Sayles et al. (1994a).\n\nThe Fire Training Area, Battle Creek ANGB, was included as part of the Bioventing Initiative. It was estimated that approximately 54,000 to 74,000 gallons of mixed waste fuels, oils, and solvents were burned at this site during fire training exercises. Soils at the site consist of fine to coarse silty sand interbedded with gravel and cobbles . Groundwater is at a depth of approximately 30 ft.\n\nAs dictated by the Bioventing Initiative protocol, one vent well and three monitoring points were installed at this site. The vent well was installed to a depth of 30 ft with 20 ft of 0.04-inch slotted screen.\n\nThe monitoring points were three-level, with screens located at depths of 8, 17, and 27 ft and were located at distances of 15, 30, and 50 ft away from the vent well.\n\nInitial treatability tests-an in situ respiration test and a soil gas permeability test-were conducted to determine the feasibility of bioventing. Oxygen utilization rates ranged from 2.9 to 22 %/day (2.0 to 15 mg/kg-day), with higher rates associated with more contaminated locations. Soil gas permeability testing demonstrated an average permeability of approximately 230 darcys and a radius of influence of greater than 50 ft. These results indicated that both the microbial activity and the permeability were conducive to an effective bioventing operation.\n\nInitial soil and soil gas samples were collected and a 1-hp regenerative blower was installed at the site for continuous air injection in September 1992. The blower was operated for 1 year and in October 1993, final soil and soil gas samples 1 were collected. Although the number of soil and soil gas samples collected was not sufficient to allow for statistically significant comparison of the data, 1 Blower operation was discontinued for 1 month prior to collecting soil gas samples to allow time for soil gas equilibration.\n\nSeptember 29, 1995 certain trends were observedfoot_17 . Final BTEX and TPH soil gas concentrations were significantly lower than the concentrations measured initially . Soil BTEX concentrations were significantly lower after 1 year of bioventing, whereas soil TPH concentrations changed little, as expected . In addition, in situ respiration rates declined from rates in the initial treatability test, which is an indication of decreased contaminant levels 2 . These results illustrate the effectiveness of bioventing at this site.\n\nBecause Michigan uses a risk-based standard for site closure, the Battle Creek site is likely to be closed based on these results.\n\nFurther details of the Fire Training Area, Battle Creek ANGB study may be found in Engineering-Science (1992).\n\nIn May 1992, the U.S. Air Force began the Bioventing Initiative to examine bioventing at 55 contaminated sites throughout the country. In December 1992, the program was increased to more than 130 sites due to increased demand by Air Force managers. To date, data have been collected from 125 contaminated sites at a total of 50 Air Force bases, one Army base, one Naval installation, and one Department of Transportation installation. Sites are located in 35 states and in all 10 U.S. EPA regions.\n\nFigure 2-2 illustrates the locations of Bioventing Initiative sites to date. The selected sites represent a wide range of contaminant types and concentrations, soil types, contaminant depths, climatic conditions, and regulatory frameworks. Sites were selected based on contamination level (preferably > 1,000 mg/kg TPH). The selections were not biased with regard to factors such as soil type or climatic conditions, in order to properly evaluate bioventing potential under both favorable and unfavorable conditions.\n\nA Bioventing Test Protocol was developed which provided strict guidelines for treatability testing and bioventing system design. The Bioventing Test Protocol was peer reviewed and was reviewed by U.S. EPA Headquarters and the U.S. EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory. Using the Bioventing Test Protocol, initial testing was conducted at each site to determine whether bioventing was feasible. Based on the initial testing, a decision was made whether to install a bioventing system for 1 year of operation. At the majority of sites (95%), a bioventing system was installed for the 1-year operational period. At the end of this time period, each Air Force base could either elect to keep the bioventing system in operation or remove it if the site were deemed to have been remediated sufficiently.\n\nAt each site in which a bioventing system was installed, a series of data was collected as described in Section 2.3: initial site characterization data consisting of soil and soil gas sampling, in situ respiration rate testing results, and soil gas permeability testing results; 6 month in situ respiration testing results; and 1-year soil and soil gas sampling and in situ respiration testing results. Data from the initial testing are summarized in Appendix B and have been used in the statistical analyses as described in Section 5.2. A summary of the results to date with potential implications is presented in the following sections.\n\nAt all Bioventing Initiative sites in which a blower was installed and operated for 1 year, initial and final soil and soil gas BTEX and TPH concentrations were measured. The approach was to compile a limited number of samples from each site and statistically analyze for trends to avoid known spatial variability. Distributions of soil and soil gas BTEX and TPH concentrations from the initial and l-year sampling events are shown in Figures 5-1 through 54, respectively. The average soil and soil gas BTEX and TPH concentrations across all sites are shown in Figure 5-5. In general, the most dramatic reductions were observed in BTEX removal in both soil and soil gas samples. As an example, soil results from Site 3 at Battle Creek ANGB are shown in Figure 56. After 1-year of bioventing operation the BTEX concentrations are very low and are no longer a source of groundwater contamination; therefore, site closure is now a viable option for this site.\n\nThe objective of the 1-year sampling event was not to collect the large number of samples required for statistical significance for a single site. Rather, the objective was to give a qualitative indication of changes in contaminant mass. Soil gas samples are somewhat similar to composite samples in that they are collected over a wide area. Thus, they provide an indication of changes in soil gas profiles (Downey and Hall, 1994). Blower operation was discontinued 30 days prior to sample collection to allow for soil gas equilibration. In contrast, soil samples are discrete point samples subject to large variabilities over small distances/soil types. Given this variability, coupled with known sampling and analytical variabilities, a large number of samples at a single site would have to be collected to conclusively determine real changes in soil contamination. Due to the limited number of samples, these results should not be viewed as conclusive indicators of bioventing progress or evidence of the success or failure of this technology.\n\nIf a risk-based approach to remediation is used which focuses on removing the soluble, mobile, and more toxic BTEX component of the fuel, remediation times can be significantly reduced. As discussed in the Tyndall AFB case historyfoot_19 , the BTEX fraction was removed preferentially over TPH.\n\nThe potential for bioventing to preferentially remove BTEX makes this technology suitable for risk-based remediations. In addition, the low levels of BTEX that have been encountered at the majority of the September 29, 1995 Bioventing Initiative sites further support an emphasis on risk-based remediation (Figure 567). Over 85% of the initial soil samples contained less than 1 mg/kg of benzene.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of the Bioventing Initiative was to develop a large database of bioventing systems from which it could be determined which parameters are most important in evaluating whether to implement bioventing. This effort is the largest field effort to date where data have been collected in a consistent manner to allow for direct comparison of results across sites. Results of the statistical analyses can be used to evaluate which soil measurements should be taken and, if bioventing performance is poor, which parameters may be adjusted to improve performance.\n\nData generated from the Bioventing Initiative were subjected to thorough statistical analyses to determine which parameters most influenced observed oxygen utilization rates. Procedures used for conducting the statistical analyses and the results of these analyses are presented in the following sections.\n\nData collected from 125 Bioventing Initiative sites have been analyzed for this study. The study involved in situ respiration test data, soil gas permeability test data, and soil chemistry and nutrient data from each site. Several parameters were measured in the soil samples. The statistical analyses had five specific objectives:\n\n• To develop a consistent statistical approach for calculating the oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production rates from the in situ respiration data.\n\n• To characterize the oxygen utilization rate as a function of parameters measured during initial testing.\n\n• To determine the relationship between carbon dioxide production rate and pH or alkalinity by characterizing the ratio of oxygen utilization rate to carbon dioxide production rate as a function primarily of pH and alkalinity.\n\n• To characterize soil gas permeability as a function of particle size and moisture content.\n\n• To compare TKN concentrations at contaminated sites with those at uncontaminated background areas.\n\nAverages for oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production rates and soil parameters were computed for each site. All subsequent analyses were performed on the site averages. Table 5-1 displays the parameters included in the statistical analyses, their units, and transformations performed on these parameters whenever necessary.\n\nData were stored in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) databases and all statistical manipulations and analyses were conducted using the SAS software package. Methods used for characterizing the data and the final regression model are presented in the following sections for each of the listed objectives.\n\nA statistical analysis was conducted to consistently calculate oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production rates. A linear, time-related change in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels that is characterized by a constant (or zero-order) rate is typical of most of the sites. However, in some sites, a two-piecewise linear change is observed. An initial rapid rate is observed followed by a leveling off. This change in rates generally occurs once oxygen becomes limiting, typically below to 10% oxygen.\n\nThe two-piecewise regression model, with a slope change at time t o , was fitted to the oxygen (and carbon dioxide) versus time data obtained at every monitoring point. The piecewise regression model is presented below:\n\n(5-2)\n\n2,..., # of observations at each monitoring point, and where: R i = measured i th oxygen or carbon dioxide level at time t i (%); α = oxygen or carbon dioxide level at initial time (%); β = rate of change of oxygen or carbon dioxide level with time (%/hr); δ = increase or decrease in the rate of change at time t o (%/hr); t 0 = time at which the slope change occurs (hr).\n\nThe piecewise regression model was implemented using the NLIN procedure (nonlinear regression procedure) in the SAS software package.\n\nThe parameter δ in the above model measures the increase or decrease in the slope at time to.\n\nTherefore, the statistical significance of δ confirmed the suitability of a two-piecewise model fitted to the data. The rate of oxygen utilization (or carbon dioxide production) was estimated from the slope of the first linear piece, β, whenever δ was statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level. For example,\n\nFigure 5-8 presents the piecewise linear model fitted to oxygen data at a monitoring point at Site FSA-1, Air Force Plant (AFP) 4, Texas, where ,β was estimated to be -1.1 %/hr.\n\nIn cases where δ was not significant at the 0.05 level, a linear regression model of the following form was fitted to the data: R i = α +βt i for all t i (5-3)\n\nwhere: the rate of oxygen utilization (or carbon dioxide production) was determined from the slope of the straight line, β.\n\nFor cases in which six or fewer observations were available at a monitoring point, or when the oxygen levels exhibited virtually no change over a short initial time period followed by a linear change, the piecewise analysis was not attempted. In such cases, a linear regression model, as described above, was fitted. In these cases, the suitability of the linear model was confirmed by inspection of the model-fit to observed data.\n\nA preliminary analysis of the untransformed data was performed in which a regression model was fitted to the oxygen utilization rate using forward stepwise regression. This model accounted for the effects of the soil parameters and their interactions. In order to reduce the effect of multicollinearity among the parameters on the fitted model, soil gas BTEX levels and gravel were excluded from the modeling. In other words, soil gas BTEX was highly correlated with soil gas TPH, and therefore it was concluded that the effect of soil gas BTEX levels on the oxygen utilization rate can almost completely be explained by soil gas TPH concentrations. Also, since the particle size levels added up to a constant value (100%), the effect of gravel was assumed to be redundant in the modeling.\n\nAs a result of fitting the regression model to the oxygen utilization rate it was found that soil particle sizes and permeability had a dominating influence on the oxygen utilization rate; that is, low levels of permeability and sand, and high levels of silt and clay appeared to correlate strongly with high oxygen utilization rates.\n\nIn order to determine whether a handful of sites were unduly influencing the statistical modeling, sites with high oxygen utilization rates were examined in detail. Seven sites in the analyses had extremely high oxygen utilization rates, well above average rates from other sites. A two-sample t-test was performed on each parameter (e.g. sand, nitrogen, etc.) to determine whether the average value of the parameter over the seven sites was different from the corresponding average for the remaining sites. This analysis revealed statistically significant differences in particle size, soil gas permeability, and soil TPH concentrations between the two groups of sites (Table 5-2). As a result of this analysis, it was determined that the seven sites with extremely high oxygen utilization rates were atypical with respect to their levels of particle size, soil gas permeability, and soil TPH concentrations.\n\nIn order to reduce the influence on the model for the oxygen utilization rate caused by these seven sites, the log transformation of the oxygen utilization rate was taken. Additionally, the log transform resulted in more normally distributed data for the oxygen utilization rate. However, sites with oxygen utilization rates near zero receive artificial importance as a result of the transformation. To eliminate this artificial effect caused by the log-transformation, all the log-transformed values of from the shape of the ellipse by comparing it to the key figure. In the key figure, comparable ellipses are displayed for distributions with known correlations of 90%, 60%, 30%, and 0%.\n\nFor example, in Figures 5-9 It should be noted that the correlation between soil temperature and oxygen utilization rate is of little practical significance in this analysis. At a given site, temperature has been shown to correlate well with microbial activity, which displays peak activity in summer months and low activity in winter months. However, it has been noted that the temperature/microbial activity relationship is very site specific. In other words, microorganisms in Alaska will show peak activity in summer months with comparable oxygen utilization rates to organisms from more temperate climates; however, soil temperatures will be significantly different. Therefore, it is not possible to correlate rates with temperature under such different climatic conditions as were seen at Bioventing Initiative sites.\n\nAmong the soil parameters, the correlation coefficient between soil gas BTEX and TPH concentrations is 0.92 (Figure 5-9) and that between pH and alkalinity is 0.75 (Figure 56789). The correlations between the particle sizes (sand, silt, and clay), moisture, and soil gas permeability are also pronounced.\n\nAfter taking the log transformation, a second regression model was fitted to the oxygen utilization rate using stepwise regression. Finally, the effect of a cyclic seasonal component on the residuals obtained from the fitted regression model was investigated by including the date that the initial in situ respiration test was conducted.\n\nThe final regression model for the oxygen utilization rate is: log(O 2 ) = -2.7 + 0.39 log (NIT) -0.108 (MOI) + 0.017 log (TPHsg) * MOI -0.004 log (TPHsg) * TMP\n\n(5-4)\n\nEach of the effects in the above model is statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nNote that the effects appearing in the model are consistent with the relationships observed in the bivariate setting. The model explains 41% of the variability in the log-transformed oxygen utilization rate; that is, a 64% correlation between the observed and model-predicted log-transformed oxygen utilization rates.\n\nFigure 5-15 illustrates actual versus predicted oxygen utilization rates based on model predictions. As\n\nshown, the model appears to explain mid-range oxygen utilization rates fairly well, but low oxygen utilization rates are not predicted as accurately. This may be due to an effect on microbial activity not measured during the Bioventing Initiative, and therefore, unexplained in the model.\n\nBecause in situ biodegradation rates are measured indirectly through measurements of soil gas oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, abiotic processes that affect oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration will affect measured biodegradation rates. The factors that may most influence soil gas oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are soil pH, soil alkalinity, and iron content.\n\nAt nearly all sites included in the Bioventing Initiative, oxygen utilization has proven to be a more useful measure of biodegradation rates than carbon dioxide production. The biodegradation rate in mg of hexane-equivalent/kg of soil per day based on carbon dioxide production usually is less than can be accounted for by the oxygen disappearance. A study conducted at the Tyndall AFB site was an exception.\n\nThat site had low-alkalinity soils and low-pH quartz sands, and carbon dioxide production actually resulted in a slightly higher estimate of biodegradation (Miller, 1990).\n\nIn the case of the higher pH and higher alkalinity soils at sites such as at Fallon NAS and Eielson AFB, little or no gaseous carbon dioxide production was measured (Hinchee et al., 1989;Leeson et al., 1995). This is possibly due to the formation of carbonates from the gaseous evolution of carbon dioxide produced by biodegradation at these sites. A similar phenomenon was encountered September 29, 1995 by van Eyk and Vreeken (1988) in their attempt to use carbon dioxide evolution to quantify biodegradation associated with soil venting.\n\nIn order to determine whether pH and alkalinity influenced carbon dioxide production rates at Bioventing Initiative sites, an analysis of the ratio of oxygen utilization to carbon dioxide production versus soil parameters was performed. Due to stoichiometryfoot_20 , the ratio of the oxygen utilization to carbon dioxide production rate will not be 1, because for every 9.5 moles of oxygen consumed, 6 moles of carbon dioxide are produced. A square root transformation of the oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production rate ratio and log transformations of some of the soil parameters were taken whenever the data were not well represented by the normal distribution. Figures 56789through 5-11 display the bivariate relationships between the ratio and the soil parameters after the transformation. In these figures, as expected, there is a negative correlation between the ratio and the oxygen utilization rate (Figure 5 The statistical methods used to model the ratio of the oxygen utilization rate to carbon dioxide production rate as a function of the soil parameters are similar to those used for the oxygen utilization rate analyses. As a preliminary step, a square root transformation of the ratio and log transformation of some of the soil parameters were taken to obtain more normally distributed data. All the transformations for the soil parameters except clay were consistent with those taken previously to model the oxygen utilization rate. A log transformation of clay was considered as it was more correlated with the ratio.\n\nAfter applying the transformation, a regression model was fitted to the ratio using forward stepwise regression. The model accounted for the effects of each of the soil parameters (except season)\n\nand their interactions. Finally, the effect of a cyclic seasonal component on the residuals obtained from the fitted model was determined by incorporating the date the initial in situ respiration test was conducted.\n\nThe final model for the ratio of the carbon dioxide production rate to the oxygen utilization rate is as follows:\n\nEach of the effects in the above model is statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nThe model explains 40% of the variability in the transformed ratio. This amounts to 63 % correlation between the observed and model-predicted transformed ratios. The effects of pH on the ratio as predicted by the model are presented in Figure 5-16. The complicated nature of the fitted regression model for the ratio makes the quantification of the effects in the model difficult. However, based on inspection of Figure 5-16, it can be seen that as pH increases, the ratio of the carbon dioxide production rate to the oxygen utilization rate decreases, as would be expected given the formation of carbonates.\n\nThe bivariate relationships between log-transformed soil gas permeability and each of the independent variables of interest are shown in Figure 5-17. In this figure, permeability is most strongly correlated with clay (r= -0.50). The magnitudes of the correlations with both moisture and sand are less pronounced and similar.\n\nThe statistical methods used here are similar to those described previously for the oxygen utilization rate and the ratio. Forward stepwise regression was used to determine a regression model for the log-transformed soil gas permeability. The independent variables of interest in the modeling were moisture content and the particle sizes (sand, silt, and clay).\n\nThe final model describing soil gas permeability is given below: log(PRM) = 3.2 -0.064 clay\n\n(5-6)\n\nBased on this model, clay alone explains 21% of the variability in the log-transformed soil gas permeability. The effect of clay on soil gas permeability as predicted by the model is presented in Figure 5-18. In this figure, the soil gas permeability levels greater than 100 have been censored; that September 29, 1995 is, they were set to a constant value of 100. Based on the regression model it is determined that an increase in clay by 5 units decreases soil gas permeability by 25 % on average.\n\nAs the preliminary step to comparing the data at background and contaminated sites, transformations of the data parameters were considered. These transformations were consistent with those taken previously to address the other objectives of the statistical analysis. After taking the transformation, statistical analyses were performed separately on each parameter (nitrogen, oxygen utilization rate, etc.).\n\nThe goal of this analysis was to determine significant differences in the levels of each parameter at background and contaminated sites, with particular interest in TKN concentrations. Measurement of TKN accounts for nitrogen sources within cellular material; therefore, it is possible that TKN concentrations may be higher in contaminated areas, where microbial populations may be higher, than in uncontaminated areas. To date, there is no significant difference between TKN concentrations at contaminated sites (average of 232 mg/kg) and those at background areas (average of 226 mg/kg).\n\nBased on the statistical analyses presented in the previous sections, the following overall conclusions are drawn:\n\n• The relationships between the biodegradation rates and the soil parameters are not very strong. However, some significant relative effects of the soil parameters stand out from the statistical evaluation conducted in the study. Namely, nitrogen, moisture, and soil gas TPH concentrations appear to be the most important characteristics influencing observed field oxygen utilization rates.\n\n• The ratio of the carbon dioxide production rate to the oxygen utilization rate correlates strongly with pH and clay levels in the soil.\n\n• Soil gas permeability correlates with each of the particle sizes (sand, silt, and clay) and moisture content; however, the relative effect of clay on permeability is most important.\n\nThe Bioventing Initiative has provided a large database of information useful in the design and implementation of bioventing systems. The statistical analyses provide guidelines for determining which parameters are most important to bioventing technology. However, these data must be balanced by experience and site-specific data. For example, sites with relatively low soil nitrogen concentrations should not be discarded as bioventing sites for this reason alone, nor should it be assumed that nitrogen addition at such sites will increase oxygen utilization rates. Data collected from the U.S. Air Force Bioventing Initiative have shown that even sites with low soil nutrient concentrations can exhibit significant microbial activity and would therefore respond well to bioventing.\n\nAPPENDIX A GLOSSARY GLOSSARY abiotic -not relating to living things, not alive acidity -measure of the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution adsorption -the process by which molecules collect on and adhere to the surface of an adsorbent solid due to chemical and/or physical forces aeration -process of supplying or introducing air into a medium such as soil or water aerobic -living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen air sparging -general term for the technology of introducing gases, usually air, beneath the water table to promote site remediation.
