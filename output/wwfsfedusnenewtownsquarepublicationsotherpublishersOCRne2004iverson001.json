Davis, CA 95616, USA Location Eastern United States.\nMethods Five species, currently confined to the eastern half of the United States and not mending into Canada, were used to assess migration potential: Diospyros virginiana (persimmon), Liquidambar styraciffua (sweetgum), Oxydendrum arboreum (sourwood), Pinus taeda (lobloUy pine), and Quercus falcata var. falcata (southern red oak). SHIFT is a matrix simulation model using simple inverse power functions to provide a distance decay of seed dispersal and is driven primarily by the abundance of the species near the boundary, the forest density within and beyond the boundary, and the distance between cells. For each cell outside the current boundary, the model creates an estimate of the probability that each unoccupied cell will become colonized over a period of 100 years. SHIFT is a'fat-tailed' migration model that aUows rare very long distance dispersal events and colonization could occur up to 500 km beyond the current distriiution boundary. Model outputs were analysed using transects through sections showing relatively low and high colonization probabilities as a result of low and high densities of target trees (high source strength) as well as high densitis of forest (high sink strength). We also assess migration potential for species by concentric rings around the current boundary\nResults\nModel outputs show the generally limited nature of migration for all five species over 100 years. There is a relatively high probability of colonization within a zone of 10-20 km (depending on habitat quality and species abundance) from the current boundary, but a small probability of colonization where the distance from the current boundary exceeds about 20 km. Whether biologically plausible or not, rare very long distance migration events are not sufficient to rescue migration. Species abundance (the source strength of migration) near the range boundary carried relatively more influence than percentage forest cover (sink strength) in determining migration rates.\nMain conclusion\nThetransect evaluation revealed the importance of abundance of the species near the boundary, indicating that rare species may have much more difficulty in unassisted northward migration due to climate change. The concentric rings analysis of the model outputs showed that only the first 10-20 km of area would have a reasonably high probability of colonization. Rare, long-distance events permit colonization of remote outliers, but much more needs to be understood about the likelihood of these rare events to predict the frequency of outlier establishment.",
    "full_text": "There is now ample evidence that the earth is warming and will continue to warm at unprecedented rates (Melillo, 1999). Climate change already may be influencing species physiology, distribution, and phenology (Hughes, 2000). Recent dimate models used by the US National Assessment for Climate C % q e W h d Assessment Synthesis Team, 2000) include the Hadley model (Hadley Centre for Climate hedidion and Research; Mivhell et aL, 1995) and the CCC model (Canadian Wjmate Cenm, Boer et d., 2000). They predict potential inaeases, over the next century, of 2.5\" and 6.6 OC, respectively, for Januaryand2.3\" and 5.0 ' C for Jnly when averaged for the eastern United States (Iverson &  Prasad, 2001). Changes of this magnitude can have dramatic effects on ecological systems (Pastor & Post, 1988; Melillo etal.,  1996; Shriner & Street, 1998; Kirschbaum, 2000; National Assessment Synthesis Team, 2000; Schiiel et al., 2000; Watson et   (2002) evaluated potential changes in suitable habitat (assuming no barriers to migration) for 80 tree species in the eastern United States. For the Hadley scenario (the least severe), 30 species were modelled so that their 'optimum' latitude of suitable habitat moved > 100 km north (5 ofthesecould move > 200 km).Withthe more sexme CCC scenario, the habitats of 35 species were predicfed to move > 100 lan (24 of these could move > 200 Ian north).\n\nThe predicted rate of climate warming likely will initiate a potential response that is substantially faster than plants historically shifted thek distribution (eg. Overpeck et d, 1991; Schwartz, 1993: Kirilenko ef aL, 2000). Rates of past mrgrations suggest that e ~n relatively rapid changes in range limits wiU be insufticient to keep pace with predicted future d i t i c change (Gear & Huntley, 1991), although it remains unclear wbetber past migrations were limited by rates of climate change or by dispersaJ capaciry of trees (Clark, 1998). Nonetheless, it has been argued that even if trees were not migrating at maximum rates possible during the Holocene, they were probably dose to the threshold of being dispersal limited (Huntley etal., 1995). Coupled with tbispotential climaticlag is the fact that, compared to the Holocene, habitat loss and fragmentation could substantially reduce the ability of certain tree species to migrate (Peters, 1990;Schwartz, 1993;Dya, 1994Dya, , 1995;;Malanson k Cairns, 1997;hen etal., 1999b). Fragmented landscapes have fewer individuals producing propagules and fewer sites for those propagules to colonize. Schwartz (1993) simulated tree migration through hypothetical landrrapes based on an average rate of 50 Inn per century, near the maximum rate in the pdaeoecological literature (eg. Davis, 1989;DeHayes etal., 2000). Schwartz (1993) found thathighly fragmmted habitats reduced the simulated migration rate to as low as 1-10 km per century. Similarly, Dyer (1995) predicts bird-dispersed trees to migrate at rates well under 15 kmlcentnry with dimatic release. Subsequent research by our gmup has confirmed this highly reduced migration rate (Iwrson etal.. 1999b;Schwartz etal., 2001). Past and likely future migration rates are driven largely by long-distance dispersal events (Shigesada &Kawasaki, 1997;Clark, 1998;Higgins &Richardson, 1999). Toward this end, undemanding the source strength of propagules has become an important issue and a research priority in predicting range shifrs (Higgins et aL 2003a.b). Source strength is a function of both the propagule production and dispersal of individual species as well as the density of trees at or near species distribution boundaries. In addition, the abundance and proximity of forest patches may play a large mle in predictions of potential futm migrations.\n\nThe abundance of aMilable sites, and their imasibility by migradng trees, can be considered a sink strength in terms of plant migration. Thus, an appropriate focus of research to better understand potential consequences of global warmingfor treemigration is to understand the relative importance of source and sink strength.\n\nIn this paper, we further refine and use a cell-based migration simulation model, SHIFT, to create a spatially explicit prediction of shifts in tree distribution given climatic release (i.e. the release of climatic restrictions to tree growth). Simulated distribution shifts are based on spatially explicit cellular simulations (Schwartz, 1993) by which the landscape is parsed into cells. Each cell is characterized by aunique location, a forest availability scalar, and an initial abundance of the target species. Colonization of initially unoccupied cells is estimated as a function of recipient ceU forest availability and the sum of the probability of each occupied cell sending a propagule to that cell. We use the current distribution of five tree species along with the d i i b ution of forested habitats in and around their ranges to model the potential rate of species distribution shifts due to dimate warming. We focused on species with current northern distribution limits in the middle latitudes of the eastern United States, and examined the spatial patterns of colonization probability for these five species with respect to proximity to the current range boundary and the relationship of migration to current abundance and distributions of forest cover.\n\nThe five tree species selected for this study were Diospyros viwniana (persimmon), Liquidambm rrymr@ua (sweetgnm), Oxydendwm arboreurn (sourwood), Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and Q u a falcnta var. falata (southern redoak). These species represent a range of life history characteristics and their current or potential future northern limit (following two scenarios of dimate change) d m not extend to the Canadian border. The distributional and ecological atuibutes of these five species are discussed in Iversou et al. (1999a) andPrasad &Iverson (1999).\n\nEfforts to model global warming responses of trees through migation have varied in terms of either specifying detailed life history attributes in order to create a highly specified model with respect to life history attributes (cg. Dyer, 1994;Higgins et al., 2003a) or creating a model with few parameters that relies on historical precedents as guides to potential future migration (e.g. Schwartz, 1993). Both types of &OTIS are important to discern critical factors driving the models and variations in possible outcomes. The latter, more generalized model is justified by the Figure 1 StudyarraoftheeastemUnitedStategwim~~boundad~ and the Appalachian Mountains (hatching) delineated.

Large uncertainties concerning the impact of dispersal syndrome on seed dispersal curves (Portnoy & Willson, 1993), as well as relatively poor wlogical information on interspecific ditkences in seed production, germination and establishment, suggest that a lightly parameterized model that uses historical migration as a model for future migration, and does not include assumptionladen life history parameters for poorly understood ecological phenomena, is an appropriate means to model fimre migration. In order to link migration models lvith landscape data and to predict future distributions of tree species in the eartern United States (Fig. I), we adopt this lightly parameterized migration model approach.\n\nA cellular model called S H E T calculates the probability of an unoccupied cell becoming colonized during each generation (also used as one model iteration):\n\nwhere Pdm,.,j is the probability of unoccupied cell i being colonized; HQ, and HQ, are habitat quality scalars for unoccupied cell i and occupied cell j, respectively, that are based on the percentage of forest cover of each !a? cell as assessed through LANDSAT images, as desaibed below; Pi, an abundance scalar, is related to the current estimated importance d u e (IV) (= abun-dance) for the migrating species in the occupied cell j (estimation described below); and D,j is the distance between unoccupied cell i and an occupied cell j. The colonization probability for each unoccupied cell is summed across all n occupied cells at each generation. Although probabilities are calculated in the range of 0-1, data are reported and mapped in this paper as permtags (0-100) for ease in readmg. The d u e of C, a rate wnstant, is derived independently for each species through trial runs to achieve a migration rate of approximately 50 km per century of that species under high (> 80% cover) forest availability and moderate Jpecies abundance condition. Note that 50 kmlcentury is on the upper end of o m Holocene migration rates among trees migrating into forested emimnments (Davis, 1981).\n\nThe value of X the dispersal exponent, determines the rate at which seed dispersal declines with &stance. As an exponent of Dl,, in the denominator, it decreases colonization with distance as an inverse power function; that is, increasing X leads to decreasing long-distana dispmal while decreasing X increases long-distance dispe~sal. For most simulations we use a value of X = 3 because it fits empirical data (Pormoy & Wflson, 1993).\n\nThe model and associated assumptions are discussed in Iverson et al. (1999b) and Schwartz etal. (2001). Other dispersal kernels are plausible (e.g. Clark, 19981, though computationally much more di&ult within this model structure. These more recent Weibull functions and our model result in 'fat tails' of a d e r a ting migration rates with time, and a large fraction of dispersal events at distances > 1 km.\n\nSHIFT was run with a grain size of 1 h2 and with an extent of the eastern United States, for several generations, equivalent to 100 years of migration under dimate release. Each mn was replicated 50 times so that each time the model simulated a cell to become occupied, a 2% chance of colonization was a c s ~e d . After 50 runs, the total likelihood of wlonimtion was summed for each cell. The number of generations in the 100-year period varied by species according to their approximate time tomaturity: 3 for southern red oak, 4 for persimmon and sweetgum, 5 for sourwood, and 6 for loblolly pine ( Bums & HonMa, 19%b lverson etal., 1999a). lhus, generation time is the primary interspecific life history attribute that varied among models.\n\nIn our simulations, both animal-and wind-dispersed species are piyen the same colonization function because there is Little empirical widence suggesting that these two forms of dispersal created signif-t differences in characteristics of seed & s p e d Historical evidence of past migrations shows no systematic dilferences between dispersal mode and migration rate: animaland wind-dispersed trees seemed to migrate at similar rates (Davis, 1981; Pitelka & the Plant Migration Workshop Group,  1997; Clark etol., 1999). Also, neither Portnoy & WlUson (1993) nor Clark (1998) found systematic differences between the shapes of n w e s that best fit animal-and wind-dispersed species.\n\nIn reality, we may find that some animal-dispersed species (e.g. those dispersed by large birds) respond very differenrly to fragmentation as a result of directed dispersal. Nonetheless, there is no procedure to model these differences explicitly. A heavily parameterized model that relies on estimates of seed production, seed & s p e d , seed germination rates, and seedling survimrship curves would carry, we feel, too many unrealistic assumptions given our limited knowledge of long-term tree performance.\n\nThe data needed for this effort included an estimate of IV (the F term in the equation) for each species and an estimate of the percentage forest (the HQ factors) in each l-km2 cell. We used nvo sources of information to characterize current dstribution and abundance within the eastern United States: Little (1971) range boundaries and 11's derived from plot data generated by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) units (Hansen rtnl., 1992). Little's (1971) provided binomial maps of the distribution of various tree species within the United States that were based on empirical observations and FIA data available at that time. The range boundaries were digitized from the Little distribution maps. In one instance for loblolly pine, we modified the Little range boundary slightly based on the N s that extended beyond the Little boundary. These were used as the smooth range boundary from which to migrate the specie$. by contrast, the IVs usually created a ragged boundary \\Ve estimated species abundance for each cell by summarizing FIA plot data for the area. Based on the relative basal area and number of stems of nearly 3 million measured trees for the eastern UnitedStates,these FIA data were used to calculate IVs as a measure of abundance (Iverson & Prasad, 1998;Iverson et al., 1999a). The IVs were calculated at the scale of the county (as reported and released by FIA) and ranged from 0 to 200, with 200 indicating single species stands. We smoothed county-level 11' s using an inverse distance weighted algorithm in Arcilnfo Grid to avoid abrupt county boundaries and distribution gaps. We then assigned the predicted abundance value to all cells that inmcated species presence from Little's range maps.\n\nHabitat quality for each cell was estimated as the percentage of forest within each grid cell. This estimate was derived from a modified classification of an AVHRR data set by Zhu & Evans (1994). Thus, habitat quality was scaled from 0 (nonforested) to 1 (100% forested). We further modified the percentage forest map by downgrading some of the Midwest 'corn belt' area for which percentage forest had been overestimated (see Iverson etal., 1989Iverson etal., , 1994)). We made no attempt to sort sites into forest w e , stand age, or current dominance within individual cells, i t . a simpli@ng assumption was that all forested habitat was suitable habitat for colonization by each species. As a result, our forest availability map overestimates actual habitat available for colonization by migrating tree species. This simplification will bias our results toward overestimating migration potential.\n\nThe output from SHIFT produces estimates of colonization probability over a period of 100 years in the area outside that currently occupied by a species. The 0-100% colonization probability scores were divided into five 20-percentile groups and mapped. To analyse in more detail the colonization probability trends extending from the boundary, two transects of 90 x 270 km were placed across the range boundary for each species, with 90 h of length inside and 180 km of length outside the boundary (Fig. 2, first column of maps). The inside portion was used to assess the abundance (F) of the species near the boundary, while the outside was broken into ten strips of 18 x 90-km to evaluate both percentage forest (HQ) and colonization probability autputs (P, , , , , , , ) incrementally distant from the range boundary.\n\nTransects were chosen to sample relatively low (labelled 'L')\n\nand high H ) colonization probabilities, which usually included low and high initial IV within the distribution (source strength) and low and high forest availability outside the initial range limit (sink strength). Mean colonization probabilities were calculated within each strip, and were plotted in conjunction with forest density on line graphs to show variation as a function of distance fromthe boundaries.\n\nTo get an overall idea of the contribution of source and sink strength, additional transects were placed across the northern and western range boundaries of the five species. Outside the current range for each species, to the north or west, were placed six 50 x 50-km boxes to sample the sink strength and resulting colonization probability, while m a t h g 200 x 2 0 0 -h boxes were placed to the inside of the range to sample source strength (Fig. 2, second column of maps). Sink strength and colonization probability were simply calculated as the mean forest density and mean probability, respectively, within each 50 x 5 0 -h box. For source strength, the forest density and importance d u e grids were multiplied so that the product of the two was sampled and averaged for each of the 200 x 200-km boxes. The resultant 30 values for sink and source strength were then plotted together with colonization probability to capture overall trends.\n\nWe conducted an additional analysis of the spatial outputs by buffering the current range boundary by concentrjc rings (distances 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,150,200,300,400 and 500 h from the species boundary), and then evaluating the average and maximum colonization probability within that ring. These metr i c ~ were calculated for all land within the rings, and for only that land which is currently forested. The rings were truncated on the east coast and the western boundary so that only the northern components of the rings were used in the calculations. Finally, the outputs were evaluated to calculate the percentage forest area potentially colonized at a 2%,5%,10%, 20% and 50% probability of colonization, again by ring. This analysis also gives an indication of the maximum distance any pixel was observed to incur some probability of colonization north of the present boundary Therefore it is an attempt to assess those rare events of long-&stance dispersal, which may be responsible for much of the rapid migration recorded in the palaeo record (Clark, 1998).

In this case, abundance ( N value) inside the range boundary was 1.12-1.14 for the two transects, while the forest cover inside was nearly 3 times higher in the H than in the L transect (Table 1). Outside the current boundary, forest cover averaged 93.5% for the H transect and 15.8% for the L transect for the first 90 !an distant from the boundary (Table 1). Consequently, colonization probability was highest of all species (55%) in the first 18-km section for the H transect, with at least a 1% probability of colonization out to 72 km (Fig. 3). The SHIFT output (Fig. 2b) showed some patches of higher colonization probability but mostly a yellow band, indicating 1-2096 probability 1&30 lan north ofthe current distribution.\n\nSourwood (Figs 2c and 3, Table 1) showed negligible migration on the L transect, primarily due to low abundance near the boundary. The H transect had hoth a higher forest cover (inside andoutside) and higher abundance than the L transect (Table 1). As a result, the colonization probability was 25% in the first 18 km, 8% in the second, and 2% in the third 18-!an block of the transect (Fig. 3). SHIFT outputs showed only a small area in West Virginia where colonization probabilities exceeded 20% (Fig. 2c). 2d and 3, Table 1) was unlike all other species, in that the higher migration rate (transect H) occurred in a zone with lower forest cover (compared to transect L) hoth inside and outside the range boundary (Table 1). Species abundance was most important, and was 3 times higher for the H transect (2.27 vs. 0.72, Table 1). Migration of sweetgum was negligible on the L aansect (Fig. 3). The SHIFT output (Fig. 2d) showed maimurn colonization probability in the southern Appalachians, increasing in elevation as the climate warms.\n\nPersimmon (Figs2e and 3, Table 1) had low abundance throughout and therefore low colonization probability except for a small Appalachian region in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and a small strip of land in southern Indiana (Fig. 2e). Only the H transect showed significant colonization probability and only for the first 18 km from the boundary (Fig. 3). The L transect, with extremely low abundance near the boundary, recorded essentially no migration even though there was forest land within which to migrate.\n\nFor loblolly pine (Figs 2f and 3e, Table I), colonization probability an the H transect was relatively high (> 8%) far the first 36 km and then dropped nearly to zero. For the L transect, colon-ization probability was about 3% for the first 18 km (highest among all species for this transect) and then dropped. Loblolly had the highest level of abundance near the boundary of all species, and forest cover was fairly high for both transects; in fact it was higher outside in the slower migrating (L) transect (92.2%) than in the H transect (66.3%, Table 1, Fig. 3). However, the abundance of lohlolly was several times higher for the H transect and this took on greater relative importance than forest density\n\nA 3d graph of sink and source strength relative to colonization probability reveals an apparent threshold of source strength needed to achieve significant colonization prohability (Fig. 4). Nearly a third of the samples have essentially no colonization probability because of low source strength, regardless of sink strength. At moderate to high source strength (generally, IV > 2.0 with > 75% forested), colonization probability rapidly increases and can then be regulated by sink strength This explanation is also borne out by a simple regression tree diagram, which shows source strength as the higher level factor and sink strength as the secondarylevel factor (Fig. 5 ) .\n\nThe probability of colonization and a summary of the area potentially colonized over 100 years, by concentric ring, are exemplified for the southern red oak in Table 2 (data for the other four species follow similar patterns and are available from the authors). The mean probability of colonization within the 10-km ring ranged from 10.8% (loblolly pine) to 29.8% (southern red oak) when all land was considered, and fmm 14.4% to 32.9% (same species) when only land currently forested was considered. Immediately apparent is the rapid reduction in mean probability of colonization as one moves from the 10-to 20-km ring and beyond (Table 2). No species had more than a 1% average probahility of colonization beyond 30 !an. However, all species had a small probability of colonization even 400-500 km distant from the current boundary.\n\nWith respect to the maximum probability of colonization exhibited by individual cells, all species had at least some cells with 100% probability of colonization within the first 10 !an,\n\nTable 1 Species importance values (abundance) and percentage forest cover Importance value Forest aver (%) inside range -.inside the current range as well as average forest cover in a 90x 9 0 -h block outside boundary Lnside Outside the current boundary.

Beyond 50-70 km, the model showed only a maximum of 6% probability of colonization for any p k l , for any species.\n\n\\Ve also evaluated, by concentric ring, the percentage of forest area with various probabilities (2-50%) of being colonized (again tabulated here only for southern red oak, Table 3). For all species except persimmon (which had extremely low abundance near the boundary), at least 50% of the forest in the first 10-km concentric ring had at least a 2% chance of being colonized within LOO years (Table 3). Even at 50% probability, at least 6% (loblolly and sourwood) and as much as 20% (southern red oak) of the forested landscape within 10 km could be colonized. However, beyond 10 km, the percentage of the landscape with a high (> 10%) probability of colonization dropped dramatically. For example, in the 10-20-km ring, only 2.4% of forest land had at least a 10% probability of being colonized by persimmon, while 16.4°/a of land could be colonized by southern red o a k No species had forest land beyond 20 km with at lest a 50% chance of being colonized over 100 years. However, all species had some area, even as far as 500 km, with at least a 2% chance of being colonized.\n\nResults show the generally limited nature of likely migration over the first 100-year period fallowing climatic release. There is a relatively high probability of colonization within a zone of 10-20 km (depending on habitat quality and species abundance) of the current boundary, but a small probability of colonization as the distance from the current boundary exceeds about 20 km.\n\nNonetheless, the model allows long-distance dispersal on rare occasions, even as far as 500 km from the current range boundary. This is a very generous, arguably unrealistically generous, upper dispersal boundary for tree seeds.\n\nThe model also demonstrates that source strength, the abundance of species near the range terminus, has important impacts on migration rate, and is relativelymore important than the forest habitat into which the species would migrate. Simply put, trees have to be present near the range boundary in sufficient numbers in order to drive migration rates. Once source strength is sufficiently high (-> 2 IV and > 75% forested), sink strength then matters by setting dispersal and colonization barriers that, if low, can slow migration. Our results confirm the importance of higher abundance near the range boundary as a  primary driver of species migration. Most species decrease in abundance toward their geographical distribution limits (Brown, 1995); we found that none of the five species evaluated has an exceptionally high level of abundance near the boundary; consequently the migration rates estimated by the SHIFT model are low. Slow migration in response to warming should thus be the expectation for most tree species that taper in abundance toward current distribution boundaries.\n\nThus, one important finding from this study is theimportance of a reasonable abundance of a species near the range boundary to obtain significant colonization probabilities. Transects for any species with low abundances near the boundary had virtually no migration over the 100-year period. If the model approximates reality, it will be difficult for currently rare species to migrate into new suitable habitat as the result of dimate change (assuming no assistance from humans). Conservation research and management should consider approaches to deal with this issue. Colonization of new habitat may be facilitated for certain species that are ~lanted outside of their current distribution as ornamental or commercial trees. Examples include persimmon and Virginia pine.\n\nAnother important finding is that, because of the narrow bands of higher colonization potential modelled for the next 100 years (< 20 km), it may be nearly impossible to differentiate a no migration response from a realistic expectation of migration based on our current imprecise knowledge ofthe limits to species distribution. Also, narrowly endemic species, for which there are too few data to model, may face an extinction crisis due to their inability to keep pace with climatic forcing. According to this model, rare species are unlikely to migrate unassisted in response to climate change.\n\nFinally, nontimber forest species, far which sufficient data are also lachng, may suffer from migration lags in response to ongoing warming.\n\nOutputs from SHIFT also indicate that the 'advancing front' of migrating species over the next 100 years likely will be concentrated in the first 10km from the current boundary. This concentrated 6ont roba ably would not keep pace with projected rates of climate warming and changes in habitat suitability. However, SHIFT also suggests the possibility, however slight, of colonization owr long distances periodically. These rare chance events may have important implications for migration rates over the long-term (Clark, 1998), and along with the potential dispersal by human activity, will likely have more impact on the overall rate of migration than the movement of the concentrated front. It should he emphasized that SHIFT incorporates numerous simplifying assumptions and thus may not reflect reality. never^ theless, we contend that our analysis contributes to a better understanding of haw tree species may respond to a warming climate and changing climate patterns.\n\nGlobalEcology and Biogeography, 13, 209-219.
