    "abstract": "This study focuses on the effects of subgrid (on general circulation model (GCM) scales) convective venting of the planetary boundary layer to the free troposphere and on the interactive effects of aerosols, ozone, UV actinic flux, and radiative forcing of climate. We developed a single-column chemical transport model (SCCTM) consistent with the global Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) GCM and Chemical Transport Model (CTM). The SCCTM includes vertical transport by convection, turbulent mixing, a flexible photochemical scheme, and interactive calculations of radiative fluxes and photolysis rates. The model is designed as a chemical and physical core to be used in a completely interactive GCM. At this time it is driven by data from the GEOS Data Assimilation System archived by the Data Assimilation Office at NASA Goddard. We simulated an ozone/aerosol pollution episode in the Baltimore-Washington region and a convective event in the central United States. These physically distinct case studies provide a thorough test for the chemical scheme and physical parameterizations employed in the SCCTM. The ozone episode simulation showed strong sensitivity to aerosol optical depth, with increased average PBL ozone due to the effects of aerosols on photolysis rates. Observed aerosols produced a surface cooling of up to 100 W m -2 and stabilized the atmosphere suppressing convection. In the convective event over Oklahoma a squall line carried pollutants into the free troposphere increasing 03 by up to 35 ppbv and peroxyacetylnitrate by up to 400 pptv. The maximum instantaneous radiative forcing due to this ozone reached 0.75 W m -2 at the tropopause level. Accurate representation of the interaction among particles, trace gases, radiation, and convection is essential for global climate models.",
    "full_text": "In this paper we study aerosol-ozone-climate interactions focusing on the effects of convection and aerosols on tropospheric ozone and on its radiative forcing. Because of the patchy distribution of sources and short life cycle of aerosols and ozone precursors, aerosol and ozone effects have a pronounced regional-scale component. Therefore we begin our development of an appropriate modeling system by studying regional-scale pollution with a Single-Column Chemical Transport Model (SCCTM). We compare our calculations to observations and cloud-resolving model calculations to test parameterizations and evaluate the role of various physical mechanisms.\n\nTransport and chemical transformation of optically active trace gases and aerosols modify the large-scale distributions of chemical species and affect their global budgets, thereby having important implications for the chemical composition of the atmosphere and its radiative properties. Being a main atmospheric oxidizing component and an optically active constitu- [Chatfield and Delany, 1990;Pickering et al., 1990Pickering et al., , 1992aPickering et al., , 1992b] ] have shown that deep convection can cause the enhancement of ozone production in the free troposphere because the photochemical 03 yield per Nex molecule increases as a result of dilution [Liu et al., 1987]. Therefore the convective lifting of Nex from the boundary layer into the free troposphere enhances the formation of 03 in the upper and middle troposphere. A prolonged lifetime of precursors and the enhanced production of 03 in the free troposphere imply an increase in total tropospheric column 03 as a result of convection over polluted areas. The changes of column content and vertical distribution of ozone in the troposphere affect absorption of radiation in the atmosphere and therefore could cause radiative forcing of climate.\n\nAerosol particles in the atmosphere scatter and absorb solar radiation. Their optical properties depend on their size and composition. Submicron sulfate aerosols are effective at scattering of solar radiation and have a cooling effect because of reflection of solar radiation back to space [Charlson et al., 1992;Kiehl and Briegleb, 1993]. Carbonaceous aerosol and mineral dust can effectively absorb solar radiation and heat the PBL [Penner et al., 1998;Ramanathan, 1999]. In the infrared spectrum, aerosols mostly absorb radiation and act like a greenhouse gas although typically the optical depth at long wavelengths is significantly less than that in the solar wavelength band. The impact of these aerosols on the Earth's radiative balance and climate (aerosol radiative forcing) has been studied extensively [Houghton et al., 1996]. However, aerosolclimate effects remain uncertain because of large temporal and spatial variability of aerosol radiative properties and the complexity of physical processes responsible for aerosol formation and loss. Aerosols affect tropospheric chemistry, providing surfaces for heterogeneous reactions [Jacob, 2000]. Along with the radiative effect on climate, aerosols also modify the UV actinic flux and the rate of photochemical reactions [Jacobson, 1997;Dickerson et al., 1997;Jacobson, 1998;Liao et al., 1999] that drive the chemistry of the atmosphere. Dickerson et al. [1997] showed that UV-scattering particles, in spite of reflection of radiation, can strongly increase the density of the photons in the PBL and accelerate photochemical reactions and ozone production. On the contrary, UV-absorbing aerosols remove the photons from the PBL and decrease ozone production and near-surface ozone mixing ratios [Dickerson et al., 1997;Kondragunta, 1997;Jacobson, 1998]. Aerosols also modify surface temperature and atmospheric stability because of their radiative effects [Jacobson, 1998;Gamazaychikov et al., 1998;Kiehl et al., 1999].\n\nObserving System general circulation model (GEES GCM) and conduct interactive chemical transport and radiation calculations. For this purpose we are working to combine the Stretched-Grid GEeS GCM [Fox-Rabinovitz et al., 1997;2001] and Stretched-Grid GEeS CTM [Allen et al., 2000]. The stretched-grid design allows us to address specifically the interaction of small-, regional-, and global-scale processes. As part of the development of the global three-dimensional (3-D) coupled chemical transport model and general circulation model we have designed a Single-Column Chemical Transport Model that represents the physical and chemical core of the 3-D chemical transport model. Here we use the SCCTM for case study calculations, which help us to evaluate the role of various competing effects, to test different chemical schemes, and to evaluate vertical mixing and radiative transport parameterizations for GCM use. We study interactions of tropospheric ozone chemistry and radiative forcing of climate, focusing on the effects of aerosols and convective mixing. It is important to test the SCCTM in a variety of conditions. Therefore we use observations from two physically different episodes: The first case is a stagnant air mass having high ozone and aerosol concentrations in the PBL, and the second case is characterized by instability and deep convection that enhances upper tropospheric ozone mixing ratios. We have also studied the radiative forcing of observed aerosols and of the increase in upper tropospheric 03 mixing ratios caused by deep convection.\n\nIn section 2 we describe the SCCTM. In section 3 we present the application of the SCCTM for two regional air pollution studies. Conclusions of the study are formulated in section 4.\n\nOne-dimensional chemical models with eddy diffusional mixing have been widely used for studying chemical processes in the atmosphere [e.g., Thompson and Cicerone, 1986]. The Single-Column Model (SCM) approach for testing parameterizations in GCMs and for interpretation of field campaign measurements was proposed by Randall et al. [1996]. This approach is based on using a complete physical description of the processes in an atmospheric column adopted from a parent GCM in combination with observed advective fluxes of heat and moisture. The SCM approach is closely tied to the Radiative-Convective Model (RCM) approach [Manabe and Wetheraid, 1967;Ramanathan, 1981]. Stenchikov and Robock [1995] used a RCM/SCM for process analysis of the diurnal asymmetry of global warming and provided a review of previous studies. Here we developed a single-column chemical and radiative transport model using parameterizations from the GEeS GCM [Takacs et al., 1994] and the 3-D Goddard Chemical Transport Model (GCTM) [Lin and Rood, 1996;Allen et al., 1996]. The model calculates vertical transport, turbulent mixing, and chemical transformations of constituents in the atmospheric column, as well as radiative transport accounting for aerosols and optically active gaseous species. A similar approach was employed by Wang et al. [2000] based on the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM parameterizations to study biomass burning effects over the tropical Pacific.\n\nThe SCCTM is driven by the assimilated data from the GEOS Data Assimilation System (DAS) [Schubert et al., 1993].\n\nHere we use output from the GEES-1 system with a resolution of 2 ø in latitude by 2.5 ø in longitude and 20 vertical layers in a sigma coordinate system extending from the surface to 10 hPa. The SCCTM could be easily reconfigured to use output from the current GEES-3 system with 1 ø x 1 ø horizontal resolution and 48 vertical layers. To improve the description of the PBL in the SCCTM we added five additional layers (0.977, 0.965, 0.938, 0.922, and 0.874 sigma values, equivalent to ---990, 978, 951, 935, and 887 hPa when surface pressure is 1013 hPa) in the lowest part of the model, typically allowing a total of eight layers to be simulated below 900 hPa. The GEES-1 data are interpolated to these additional layers. The SCCTM calculation is performed for a 2 ø x 2.5 ø grid cell centered on a latitude and longitude selected by the user. The GEeS DAS data are horizontally interpolated to this location. The meteorological input parameters used to conduct model calculations include surface pressure, temperature, specific humidity, and turbulent kinetic energy at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UT, 3-houraveraged PBL depth, 6-hour-averaged cloud mass flux, and convective cloud detrainment. The SCCTM could be forced by the large-scale advection of chemical constituents calculated using the GEOS DAS fields if detailed distributions of chemical species were available. Below we give detailed descriptions of the physical processes implemented in the SCCTM.\n\nSMVGEAR II is a sparse matrix vectorized Gear-type firstorder differential equation solver [Jacobson, 1995]. It includes flexible kinetic and photolytic chemical reaction packages. The software allows easy addition and removal of reactions and species. The current chemical scheme includes 96 chemical species (all of which are transported) accounting for 03, NOx, and hydrocarbon chemistry. To focus the chemical scheme on tropospheric ozone photochemistry we disregard all predominantly stratospheric reactions and reactions involved with chlorine, sulfur, and bromine from the full set of kinetic and photolytic reactions that came from Jacobson [1994]. We include heterogeneous loss of N:O s on aqueous aerosols assuming pseudo-first-order reaction in this calculation. The final scheme includes 200 kinetic and 19 photolytic reactions.\n\nMixing Vertical transport of trace gases and aerosols by deep convection is parameterized in the SCCTM using the cumulus mass flux and detrainment calculated with the Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) algorithm [Moonhi and Suarez, 1992; Arakawa and Schubert, 1974] and archived by the GEOS DAS. The RAS algorithm is used to parameterize convection in all versions of the GEOS GCM. Therefore the convective forcing and the dynamical fields used for driving the SCCTM are consistent.\n\nThe change of mixing ratio of a particular chemical constituent as a result of convective mixing is determined by solving iteratively a coupled linear system that defines the upward mass flux due to convection across the edges of model layers [Allen et al., 1996]\n\nWe assume that emissions and dry deposition take place only in the bottommost layer of the model. The increase in concentration c a due to emission is calculated with the equation OC 9 Je : ,\n\nOt z• where Je (molecules cm-2 s-1) is the emission flux and z • is the height of the bottommost layer. The changes of concentrations due to the dry deposition are calculated using the deposition flux J d, which is parameterized as the product of the concentration c g and the deposition velocity vd: 0 C g v•c • Jd ..... . (4) Ot z• z•\n\nThe deposition velocities for different species are adopted from Sander and Crutzen [1996] and are constant throughout the model runs.\n\nWe use a modified form of the scheme of Allen et al.\n\n[2000] for removing soluble species from the atmosphere in precipitation. We have applied this scheme to HNO 3, H:O:, and H:CO in the SCCTM. Loss of the soluble species is assumed to occur continually as a first-order loss process dependent on altitude. In addition, these species are removed more rapidly on an episodic basis during periods of convective precipitation. For example, for nitric acid a lifetime of 5 days is assumed from the surface to 600 hPa with the lifetime increasing to -50 days at 200 hPa. In convective precipitation the lifetime is assumed to be 1 day at sigma levels where liquid droplets are plentiful (temperature greater than 258 K). Lifetimes for rainout for the other species are taken from Warneck [1988].\n\nSolar radiation not only provides the energy for the climate system but also drives photochemical reactions. In this section we discuss our techniques for calculating radiative forcing by aerosols and trace gases and for calculating photolysis rates in a polluted atmosphere using observed aerosol characteristics.\n\n2.5.1. Photolysis rate calculations. We improved the radiation model of Dickerson et al. [1997] for calculating photolytic reaction constants to include the 19 photolytic reactions shown in Table 1. The radiation model uses the Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) scheme [Stamnes et al., 1988] for calculating solar radiances for 16 angular ordinates. The MIE package [Wiscombe, 1980] is implemented for calculating aerosol optical properties: extinction coefficient, asymmetry factor, phase function, and single scattering albedo. Typically, we calculate the photolysis rates off-line, but in some cases we conduct the radiative calculations interactively. Interactive calculations are time-consuming but allow us to account for time variations of ozone and aerosol. For the more economic off-line calculations the solar irradiances and mean ac-\n\nTable 1.

Therefore we specified cloud optical depth based on cloud type and temperature [Takacs et al., 1994].

Radiative forcing calculation. We implemented on-line radiation transport calculations in the SCCTM using the radiative transfer parameterizations from the GEOS GCM [Chou, 1992;Chou and Suarez, 1994;Chou et al., 1995]. The parameterizations for solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer account for N20 , CH4, CFCll, CFC12, CFC22, H20 , CO2, 03, and aerosols. In the solar radiation routine the effects of the absorption and scattering due to clouds and aerosols, as well as Rayleigh scattering, are included. We assumed land surface albedo of 16% in the visible and in the near infrared.\n\nWe use the radiative transfer parameterization to compute radiative forcing due to changes in the vertical distribution of optically active trace gases and aerosols. The radiative forcing calculations presented here are performed at each time step using the computed trace gas mixing ratios. The atmospheric variables from the GEOS-1 DAS and the vertical distribution of gases including water vapor are provided at every time step.\n\nIn this section we present the results of two physically dif-\n\nWe calculate actinic flux and photolysis rates as a function of altitude with and without urban aerosols; we use these photolysis rates in the SCCTM simulations to evaluate the effect on photochemical 03 production. We use finer vertical resolution than that used by Dickerson et al. [1997] (12 layers below 4 km versus 7 layers in the UAM-V and 5 layers below 0.5 km versus 4 layers in the UAM-V), which enables us to better resolve the vertical transport and chemistry in the PBL, where the complex chemistry and dynamical mixing take place, and to better describe the ozone production above the PBL.\n\nIn this study we take advantage of routine Sun photometer observations conducted on the grounds of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland [Holben et al., 1998 [1982] and Liao et al. [1999].\n\nIn this calculation we consider hydrolysis of N205 on aerosols. The first-order rate constant [see Jacobson, 1994] for heterogeneous loss is a strong function of reaction probability and aerosol surface area. The reaction probability has a large uncertainty (in the range 0.01-1). We used a most probable value of 0.1 recommended by Jacob [2000]. The total aerosol surface area is calculated using the observed size-number distribution and is uniformly distributed in the 1-km aerosol layer. To quantify the radiative effect of aerosols on photochemical ozone production in the PBL we conducted calculations including heterogeneous removal of N20 • for both aerosol and no-aerosol conditions, as well as calculated the effect of heterogeneous chemistry itself.\n\nOzone production is highly sensitive to concentrations of ozone precursors [e.g., Liu et al., 1987]. Therefore model initial conditions may be a crucial factor for ozone evolution in the simulation. We performed sensitivity calculations over two different periods of time (starting on July 9 and July 11) using initial background concentrations found in rural eastern U.S. environments. We found that the SCCTM solution quickly reached the same regime regardless of the starting time of calculations. It shows that in our case there is only moderate sensitivity to initial conditions.\n\nFor the July 12-15 case study the ozone precursor emissions were calculated by averaging OTAG emissions at grid points within 1 ø (1.25 ø) in the north-south (east-west) direction of the Greenbelt, Maryland, site (39.01 ø in latitude, -76.87 ø in longitude) for each corresponding day. Over 24 data grids of OTAG emissions are generally included in the averaged emission used in the SCCTM calculation. The use of averaged emissions may result in underestimating the peak ozone mixing ratio because the spatial variation of precursor emissions is smoothed over our grid cell.\n\nFigure 2  model layer). Model results show that UV-scattering particles generally increase ozone production within the 1000-m layer but decrease surface ozone by -15 ppbv on July 15. The magnitude of the increase in our calculated ozone averaged below 500 m (--•4 ppbv) at noon is in reasonable agreement with the variable-grid urban airshed model (UAM-V) calculations (-5 ppbv) of Dickerson et al. [1997]. The results show a strong dependence of ozone production on aerosol effects at different altitudes within the PBL, though the scattering aerosols result in an increase in bulk 03 production in the PBL. There is a distinct diurnal cycle of ozone changes due to aerosols as shown in Figure 2. The peak of the ozone increase is near noon, and the maximum ozone decrease is before sunset or just after sunrise. The ozone decrease is due to the fact that the decrease in near-surface j (NO2) due to boundary layer aerosols is larger at high solar zenith angle. The maxi-mum decrease in j (NO2) at the lowest model layer (indicated as \"surface\" in Figure 2) is -75% relative to no-aerosol conditions for solar zenith angle 80 ø . Under the hazy sky condition, the ratio of diffuse to direct radiation in the total actinic fluxes increases relative to that for the no-aerosol condition. For small solar zenith angles the increase in diffuse flux compensates for the attenuation of solar direct flux by aerosols. For a high solar zenith angle the diffuse radiation available for photolysis near the surface decreases because attenuation of radiation dominates owing to an increase in effective optical depth [Dickerson et al., 1997]. Calculations with and without including N20 5 hydrolysis on aerosols show that N20 5 removal decreased NOx mixing ratios  turned out to be comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign with the radiative enhancement of ozone production due to the aerosol-induced increase in photolysis rates. It shows that both effects are equally important and should be accounted for in detail. However, at the present time there is considerable uncertainty with the representation of heterogeneous chemistry in the models [Jacob, 2000]. 3.1.2. Effect of diurnal variation of aerosol vertical distribution on ozone production in the PBL. The fixed-in-time vertical distribution of aerosols used in section 3.1.1 is a simplification. Because of diurnal variation of the PBL depth and turbulent mixing (as well as aerosol sources), the aerosol vertical distribution changes during the day. The aerosol diurnal variation affects the ozone production differently throughout the day. To evaluate the role of this effect, we implemented a diurnal cycle of aerosol distribution in the SCCTM and conducted photolysis rate calculations interactively accounting for the vertical ozone and aerosol profiles provided by the SC-CTM. For this simulation we set the depth of the aerosol layer equal to that of the PBL, which varies with time, and we assumed a linear decrease of aerosol optical depth with height (equivalent to a vertically uniform aerosol concentration distribution) up to the top of the PBL where it vanishes. Figure 3 shows the results of the interactive model calculations with and without aerosols in comparison with surface ozone observations. The model results presented show the ozone concentrations at the lowest model layer. The larger ozone mixing ratios on July 15 from the model interactive calculation with diurnal variations of aerosol vertical distribution are in better agreement with the observations than the interactive model results with no aerosols. The increase in other days may also arise from differing aerosol amount and characteristics on those days.\n\nThe interactive model calculations with variable aerosol layer captures the important observed effect of the dramatic increase of 03 mixing ratios on July 15 compared to the previous days. For example, our previous calculations with a fixed 1-km aerosol layer showed that aerosols caused a decrease in near-surface ozone mixing ratios.\n\nComparison between calculations and observations for species other than 03 is not possible, because other species were not measured at the Greenbelt site. However, the nearest station with NO measurements (Fort Meade, 16 km to the north) shows good agreement with the model on all days for the timing of the NO peak. It also shows good agreement of the NO mixing ratios on two days (-8 ppbv on July 11 and -1 ppbv on July 15), but the model underestimated the observed values on the other three days. NO mixing ratios would be expected to be much more spatially variable than 0 3 in the real atmosphere because NO is directly emitted by automobiles. Therefore NO will be highly dependent on the sampling location relative to major highways and on traffic volumes on the specific days. Given the daytime underestimates of NO, we suspect that NO emissions at night may be too low in the model. There appears to be insufficient NO to titrate ozone to the observed low values. and no-aerosol simulations. At all times the vertically averaged ozone mixing ratio is larger in the simulation in which aerosols are considered than in the simulation without aerosols. The difference varies from -3 to 8 ppbv. This result clearly demonstrates the importance of the inclusion of aerosols in photochemical simulations of polluted boundary layers. 3.1.3. Climate radiative forcing of observed aerosols. We use the radiative routines implemented in the SCCTM to calculate the radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone. The difference of radiative fluxes at the tropopause, computed with and without the aerosols using the same meteorological fields from GEOS DAS, is the aerosol radiative forcing of the atmosphere at any given time as per the definition of instantaneous radiative forcing [see Houghton et al., 1996]. Here we use the term \"aerosol radiative forcing\" in a wider sense and assume that it includes the changes of instantaneous radiative fluxes caused by aerosols at all model levels. We conduct calculations for clear-sky conditions because very little cloudiness was observed. In the context of this study, aerosols affect climate by absorbing and scattering radiation; they also affect the photochemical production of 0 3 (through modification of photolysis rates). Altered 03 mixing ratios, in turn, produce their own effects on the radiative balance. We do not consider here the aerosol indirect radiative forcing through the effect on cloud microphysics. Because the vertical distribution of aerosol does not have an important effect on radiative forcing at the surface 28,760 PARK ET AL.: REGIONAL AIR POLLUTION AND ITS RADIATIVE FORCING 3.3 3 2.7 ::!• •-'il 2.4 2.1 1.8 1.5 1.2 ' 0.6 0.3 DJI•J 122j4UL 36 .: 84 120 3.3 2.7 2.4 2.1 1.8 1.5 1.2 0.9 0.6 0.3 Time(Local) :: •. i'•:..•..: 108 Figure 6.

(a) Changes in net longwave fluxes (downward) and (b) changes in net shortwave fluxes (downward) with aerosols versus with no aerosols (W m-•). and we do not have detailed information about aerosol vertical distribution from observations, we assume that aerosols are uniformly distributed in the lowest 1-km model layer as in the initial photolysis rate calculation. Our results show that the effect of boundary layer aerosols outweighed that of the resulting change of ozone on the radiative balance. In these simulations we calculate aerosol radiative parameters (optical depth, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor) using the three size distributions observed on July 15, 1995, and the refractive index from the retrieval procedure (see section 3.1.1). The Mie calculations for all three size distributions yielded single scattering albedo ro = 0.96, and asymmetry parameter # = 0.69 + 0.03 for 380 nm. The radiative forcing calculation is insensitive to small variations in size distribution. The third parameter needed for radiative forcing calculations is aerosol optical depth, which we take as z -2.0 for 380 nm in the UV in accordance with the observations taken during the day. In the visible at 550 nm the corresponding observed optical depth is z -1.28 (AERONET, http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa. gov/), single scattering albedo ro = 0.96, and asymmetry parameter # = 0.65 _+ 0.03. We also provide the calculated 03 to the radiative transfer calculation at each time step, although the effect of changes in these ozone amounts is negligible. The same meteorological fields from the GEOS DAS that were used in the chemical transport calculations are also used in the radiative computations. Figure 6 shows changes in the net downward longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) fluxes (i.e., the radiative forcing caused by aerosols). Aerosols absorb longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface and increase the downward irradiance within the aerosol layer. The peak increase in net longwave flux up to 4.5 W m -2 very close to the surface. However,\n\nTable 2.

This diffusion approximation of the effect of advection is similar to the nudging term used by Ghan et al. [2000] and tends to return the disturbed mixing ratios to the background level. The diffusion coefficient accounts for the horizontal grid spacing and depends on the velocity field. Clouds as diagnosed by the GEOS-I DAS are used in both the photolysis rate and radiative forcing calculations. The clouds diagnosed by the assimilation during the July 10-11 convective event are used in the region of convection, whereas average cloud conditions for each 6-hour period over the region downstream of the convection (30-40øN; 70-90øW) are used on the subsequent days. These spatial averages of cloud fraction, when averaged over the 6 days following the convection, were -0.50-0.55 at altitudes up to -9 km with values decreasing to -0.2 at 13 km. 3.2.1. Convective transport of ozone precursors. Figure 7 shows CO mixing ratios simulated with the SCCTM for rural and urban initial conditions. Convective mixing increases CO concentrations in the free troposphere for both cases. The CO mixing ratios reach a peak value at -8 km for rural conditions (-130 ppbv) and between 7 and 10 km for urban simulations (-160 ppbv) soon after the convection started on June 10-11. Subsequently, the CO mixing ratios decrease with time owing to chemical and advective losses. In the SCCTM simulation we do not calculate any further convective transport after the June 10-11 event such that we can isolate the effect of that event  12 11 •.•10 • 8 •) 7 m 6 :• 5 <r 4 3 2 1 13 12 11 •.•10 •-• 8 •) 7 m 6 :• 5 <: 4 3 2 1 13JUN 1985 Rurol oir, cleor sky Rurol oir with clouds 14JUN 15JUN 16JUN 17JUN 13JUN 14JUN 15JUN 1985 Urbon plume, cleor sky Urbon plume with clouds 13JUN 14JUN 15JUN 16JUN 17JUN 13JUN 14JUN 15JUN 1985 1985 Time(UT) Time(UT) Figure 12.

Both the clear and average cloud calculations show positive total radiative forcing (longwave + shortwave) in the free troposphere and at the tropopause after the June 10-11 convection and also show a strong correlation between the changes in 03 mixing ratios and radiative forcing in upper troposphere in agreement with Lacis et al. [1990] and Wang et al. [1993]. Using a general circulation model, Roelofs [1999] showed that the effect of clouds is to attenuate the longwave forcing at the tropopause (-0.08 W m -2 with instantaneous cloud; -0.06 W m -2 with monthly averaged cloud) but slightly increase shortwave forcing at the tropopause (0.04 W m -2 with instantaneous cloud; 0.06 W m -2 with monthly averaged cloud). A recent estimate of the global annual average radiative forcing due to changes in greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N20, and the halocarbons) since preindustrial times is 2.45 W m -2 [Houghton et al., 1996]. Numerous model studies [e.g., Brasseur during summer. The maximum annual mean clear-sky instantaneous radiative forcing exceeds 0.9 W m -2 from the results of Haywood et al. [1998]. Our results show that the maximum regional contribution to total (longwave + shortwave) ozone radiative forcing exceeds 0.75 W m -2 owing to the increase in upper tropospheric ozone resulting from the urban plume redistribution by the June 10-11 Oklahoma convection (Figures 11 and 12). However, this value is valid only for a region and for a short duration and cannot be directly compared with the literature values cited above. However, it is a nonnegligible amount of radiative forcing, compared with the total ozone effect. Although this result should be considered as an upper limit, it implies a significant role for deep convective mixing in regional-and global-scale chemical budgets and radiative forcing. This result demonstrates that accuracy of deep convective parameterizations is essential in global analyses of radiative forcing and climate response.\n\nTo build a bridge from regional to continental and global scales, we have attempted to estimate a regional radiative et al. after the June 10-11 convective event is 0.375 W m -2, averaged over the rural and urban cases. We extrapolate this increase in energy to the central United States by multiplying this radiative forcing by the average fraction of area covered with convective plumes. From ISCCP we know that the average deep convective cloud cover is 7.9%. We assume that cloud outflow plumes extend over an area 3-5 times as large as the convective regions themselves at the end of 24 hours of transport [Thompson et al., 1994]. If these factors are applied, the regional radiative forcing averaged over the month is calculated to be between 0.09 and 0.15 W m -2. We consider these estimates as minimum values because of the probable underestimate of deep convective cloud cover by ISCCP [Klein and Hartmann, 1993] and, moreover, because the convective plumes over the central United States persist for longer than 24 hours.\n\nUsing the SCCTM we have conducted two case study calculations and tested the employed parameterizations and physical schemes. In each case we performed analyses of the effects of various atmospheric processes and investigated the sensitivity of the model results to model input parameters, particularly focusing on convection and aerosols. In agreement with the previous investigations, we found that typically observed east coast U.S. aerosols (case 1) tend to increase the photochemical ozone production in the PBL owing to increased photolysis rates and the possible suppression of convection. The effect on 03 production of heterogeneous loss of N20 5 on aerosol is comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign with the radiative effect of aerosols on photolysis rates. In the central United States (case 2), ozone production in the upper and middle troposphere was enhanced following deep convective transport of pollution and lightning NOx. Radiative forcing of observed aerosols (case 1) and chemically produced ozone (case 2) appears to be significant at least on a regional scale. Specific findings are as follows.\n\n1. In the East Coast urban simulation (case 1) the calculated 03 mixing ratios are in reasonable agreement with the ozone measurements at the Greenbelt, Maryland, site. The results show strong sensitivity of calculated surface 03 to aerosol optical depth and aerosol vertical distribution (depth of the aerosol layer).\n\n2. Interactive calculations with a diurnally varying vertical distribution of aerosols showed that this effect causes significant time variation of the vertical profiles of the photolysis rates and, in combination with the vertical distribution of ozone precursors and the diurnal cycle of solar radiation, could significantly affect ozone production. Ozone production at the surface can be either increased or decreased, depending on the depth of the aerosol layer. However, vertically averaged ozone mixing ratios in the PBL were larger on all days in the simulation with aerosols than in the simulation without aerosols.\n\n3. In the central U.S. convection simulation (case 2) we showed that convective mixing and lightning NOx production result in major changes in the profiles of ozone precursors and hence increase free tropospheric 03 by up to 35 ppbv and PAN by up to 400 pptv for urban plume conditions.\n\n4. The results of convective mixing calculations using the SCCTM parameterizations are in good agreement with cloud-resolving calculations of Pickering et al. [1992b]. The top of the cloud in the GEOS-1 DAS (and hence in the SCCTM), however, is lower than that obtained with the cloud-resolving model, which compared favorably with observations. The SC-CTM cloud detrained more ozone precursors at higher altitude than in the cloud-resolving model, which affects the vertical profile of resulting ozone production rates.\n\n1 • 1I--IU, 1770."
