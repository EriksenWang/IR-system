    "abstract": "Although they usually comprise less than 10 percent of forest cover in western forests, hardwoods contribute greatly to sustaining biological richness. Hardwoods are highly preferred as cavity sites, are preferred foraging sites for several bird species, encourage insectivorous mammals and amphibians, and provide preferred substrate for many cryptogams and invertebrates. In the Pacific Northwest, two cavity-nesting species choose hardwoods for 70 percent or more of their nest sites, while many prefer hardwoods, even in coastal forests where hardwoods are scarce. Because many forest-dwelling species in the Pacific Northwest show strong preferences for hardwoods, hardwoods should be retained and managed as desired trees.\n1 An abbreviated version of this paper was presented at the Symposium on the Ecology and Management of Dead Wood in Western Forests,",
    "full_text": "Hardwoods provide three major resources to forest-dwelling organisms: substrate, foraging sites, and suitable places to rear young (including cavity sites). They provide these resources differently than do conifers because of differences in the chemistry and structure of their leaves, bark, and wood. Though many nonvertebrates species respond positively to those differences, we concentrate on vertebrates, and note contributions to non-vertebrates only briefly. We focus on species of the Pacific Northwest, including Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and northern Nevada and California. References to other regions are included to indicate trends where forestry has been practiced longer, or where particular groups of species are well documented.\n\nWe first note differences between hardwoods and conifers that make hardwoods more favorable to some organisms. Because dying and dead hardwoods are recruited from living hardwoods, we review contributions of living hardwoods to species richness, including the role of riparian areas. We then discuss the three major contributions hardwoods make to biological richness as substrate, foraging sites, and locations to rear young. Finally, we summarize management implications of our review.\n\nFrom the perspective of forest-dwelling organisms, hardwoods differ from conifers in their leaves, bark, and wood. Most conifer trees retain their leaves for years. In temperate regions, most broad-leaved trees and shrubs are deciduous, and invest less energy than do conifers in the production of secondary compounds to deflect herbivory (Longhurst andothers 1968, Wahlenberg 1946). As a result, hardwood leaves host numerous herbivorous insects that benefit many birds (Schimpf andMacMahon 1985, Willson andComet 1996b). As they fall to the ground, these leaves form a readily digestible litter that encourages a rich arthropod fauna, thereby benefiting ground-foraging insectivores (Hoff 1957, Willson andComet 1996b). Because the bark of many hardwood species is relatively rich in nutrients and has a higher pH than most conifer bark (Barkman 1958), hardwoods provide preferred substrate for some epiphytic bryophytes and lichens.\n\nThe tendency for hardwood trees of the Pacific Northwest to decay earlier than conifers (Cline 1977) may be associated with bark features and is a product of differences in wood chemistry. Because hardwood bark is typically much thinner than conifer bark, small wounds can provide entry ports for fungi. Once fungi are inside, hardwoods of the Pacific Northwest are less resistant to their growth than are conifers because hardwoods produce smaller amounts of resins and toxic extractives that combat decay fungi (Anonymous 1967). Thus, hardwoods provide potential cavity sites at relatively young ages and less durable logs. Differences in wood chemistry and structure also favor particular insects. Some woodpeckers feed primarily on insects restricted to hardwoods; and where hardwoods have declined significantly, these species are threatened. The middle-spotted woodpecker (Picoides medius), for example, disappeared from Sweden in 1980 (Bernes 1994). In the Pacific Northwest, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) and some sapsucker species restrict their feeding largely to hardwoods (Beal 1911, Wells andSteeger 1999).\n\nHardwood stands provide an abundant insect fauna and numerous cavity sites and have been reported as having greater vertebrate richness than conifer stands (Bruce and others 1985). Because birds are the richest vertebrate group of both insectivores and cavity users, trends in richness should be most apparent among birds. Associations of some birds with hardwoods are especially strong. In the Okanagan region of British Columbia, 94 percent of Bullock's oriole (Icterus bullockii) nest sites were in deciduous trees (Cannings and others 1987). In Oregon, Hagar and others (1995) reported several bird species almost exclusively associated with hardwood stands (e.g., warbling vireo [Vireo gilvus] and yellow warbler [Dendroica petechia]), including 19 species associated predominantly with trembling aspen Populus tremuloides (e.g., red-breasted sapsucker [Sphyrapicus ruber] and lazuli bunting [Passerina amoena]). Bunnell and others (1999) considered birds to have strong associations with hardwoods if at least two-thirds of their reported nests were in hardwood species. Under that restriction, about 40 bird species in British Columbia are strongly associated with hardwoods for nesting, and another 45 to 50 use hardwoods disproportionately to hardwood abundance.\n\nUnmanaged stands are rarely completely conifer. Table 1 summarizes bird data from the Pacific Northwest by stand type as determined by the most abundant tree species. Riparian was defined by proximity to water, where hardwoods are generally more abundant. In seven of the nine studies, bird species richness was highest in riparian areas or stands in which the leading species was aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwood (Populus balsamifera), or spruce (Picea spp). All of these stands were mixtures of hardwoods and conifers, occurring on moist, productive sites. The riparian area of Theberge (1976) is from gravel outwash plains, where understory was less dense than in most forested riparian areas. Because studies assessed abundance in different ways (table 1), we standardized measures within studies by dividing all abundance measures by the highest in a given study. Like richness, highest densities tended to occur in riparian areas or stands in which aspen, cottonwood, or spruce were common. The pattern appears to be that mixtures (such as spruce-cottonwood) increase both richness and abundance, and that moister sites (spruce and riparian) favor richness or abundance as much as the presence of hardwood tree species themselves.\n\nBecause deciduous trees and shrubs are concentrated in moister or riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest, it is difficult to separate effects of the greater productivity of these areas from the presence of hardwoods. The most consistent feature of bird communities using riparian areas is that many preferentially nest or forage in deciduous trees and shrubs (e.g., Bull and Skovlin 1982, Morgan and Wetmore 1986, Sanders and Edge 1998). Of perching birds showing significant preference for riparian areas, 70 percent (14/20) nested predominantly in hardwood trees or shrubs (Bunnell and others 1999). Deciduous vegetation supports a diverse insect fauna. As expected, all (20/20) of the perching birds that were significantly more abundant in riparian areas were primarily insectivorous during breeding, which was also true of 82 percent of the mammals, among which insectivores are less common (Bunnell and others 1999). Most forest-nesting waterfowl require cavities that commonly are more available in hardwoods than in conifers. Need for cavity sites also may explain why fisher (Martes pennanti) maternal dens were located in sites within or next to riparian habitat, where large, decay-prone cottonwood trees were available (e.g., Weir 1995). Mammals, reptiles, and amphibians showing positive associations to deciduous trees and shrubs, also show affinities for riparian areas where deciduous species are more abundant (Gomez andAnthony 1996, McComb andothers 1993). Thus, much of the commonly higher vertebrate richness in riparian areas may be a product of the greater abundance of hardwood trees and deciduous shrubs.\n\nTo assess the role of upland hardwoods, we stratified data from 286 50-meter radius bird census plots in south central British Columbia into four classes: riparian (adjacent to water; > 85 percent conifer), hardwood riparian (> 15 percent trembling aspen), upland conifer (primarily Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menzieseii] and lodgepole pine [Pinus contorta]), and upland hardwood (> 15 percent trembling aspen). The richest sites were hardwood riparian sites (fig. 1). Upland hardwoods had significantly greater bird richness than upland conifers (least significant difference; P = 0.04); hardwood riparian hosted greater richness than riparian (least significant difference; P = 0.059). We conclude that even on upland areas, small inclusions of aspen help to increase vertebrate richness. Huff and Raley (1991) reached a similar conclusion for coastal forests.\n\nHardwoods provide preferred substrate for many non-vertebrates. Aspen is particularly favored by bryophytes and lichens (Brodo 1974, Gustafsson and Ahlén 1996, Kuusinen 1994). In north and central Sweden, 20 percent of the red-listed, epiphytic bryophytes occur on aspen, despite the fact that aspen comprises only 1.5 percent of the total forest volume (Hallinbäck 1996). Berg and others (1994) reviewed 1,487 threatened species in Sweden, and found 290 restricted to old, living trees. Of those, 85 percent (mostly invertebrates) were restricted to hardwoods. Of 70 forest-dwelling mosses of the Pacific Northwest reviewed by Vitt and others (1988), at least 5 species appear restricted to hardwoods. In British Columbia, 45 lichen species are reported as largely restricted to hardwoods (Goward 1999, andGoward andothers 1994). As with birds, small inclusions of hardwoods apparently encourage lichen richness within conifer stands. In montane forests of British Columbia, more lichen species occur on conifers adjacent to aspen than on conifers distant from aspen (Arsenault and Goward 2000). Among macrofungi, at least 440 species in British Columbia have hardwoods as their substrate (Fernando and others 1999). Data on invertebrate affinities for hardwoods in the Pacific Northwest are sparse, but elsewhere, aspen trunks and litter host rich invertebrate faunas (Niemelä and others 1992, Siitonen and Martikainen 1994). Small natural or experimental inclusions of aspen litter in conifer forests created aggregations of land snails and predatory forestfloor arthropods (Niemelä 1997).\n\nData on amounts of hardwoods required are sparse. Hazell and others (1998) evaluated responses of four aspen-specific, epiphytic bryophytes in Sweden to a range of aspen densities and found a positive response only to aspen diameter. We believe the response to diameter reflects the fact that larger trees usually have been present for a longer time. Because bryophyte dispersal distances are short (Hedenäs and others 1989;Miles andLongton 1990, 1992), dispersal must be slow. Larger trees have been available to rare colonization events for a longer period of time. Moreover, their rougher bark may provide favorable substrate for establishment. Because aspen density had little influence on epiphyte abundance but diameter did, scattered older trees may be valuable for some epiphytes. Hazell and Gustafsson (1999) evaluated survival and vitality of lichen and bryophyte transplants in mature forests, aspen patches in clearcuts (aggregated retention), and scattered trees in clearcuts (dispersed retention). Both the lichen and the bryophyte species survived on the scattered trees. Ås (1993) found that small patches of hardwoods sustained woodliving beetles. In short, many more non-vertebrate species than vertebrate species require hardwoods, and many respond positively to small hardwood inclusions within conifer forests.\n\nInsectivorous amphibians, reptiles, and mammals often show preferences for hardwood stands and associated deciduous understory, where they forage in a leaf litter rich in prey (Bunnell and others 1999). We collated studies that permitted estimation of selection by primary excavators while foraging (table 2). Because we were interested in direct comparisons between studies, we used Chesson's alpha (Chesson 1983). It ranges from 0.0 at complete avoidance to 1.0 when all foraging was on a single species. Of the 11 studies for which we were able to calculate alpha, hardwoods ranked first or second in preference in six. Other workers have reported foraging concentrated on hardwoods, but their data did not permit calculation of preference. For example, foraging of the red-naped sapsucker (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) in British Columbia was largely limited to trembling aspen and paper birch (Betula papyrifera; Wells and Steeger 1999), and acorn woodpeckers are almost completely restricted to hardwoods in California (Beal 1911). Although sapsuckers create sapwells in hardwoods, most woodpeckers are primarily gleaning rather than drilling when foraging on hardwoods, consistent with the rich insect fauna on hardwood trunks reported by Sittonen and Martikainen (1994). Hardwoods often provide foraging sites at smaller sizes and younger ages than do conifers (Bunnell and others 2002).\n\nHardwoods provide favorable sites to rear young in several ways. Many birds preferentially nest in hardwoods, and some species nesting upslope bring fledged young into hardwood riparian areas to forage on the abundant insects (Bunnell and Dupuis 1995). Insectivorous amphibians, reptiles, and mammals exploit the abundant prey in deciduous leaf litter. Still more species select hardwoods as cavity, denning, or roosting sites. Preferential use of tree species as cavity sites usually is related to decay characteristics, but can be influenced by foraging specialization. At least 10 primary excavators in the Pacific Northwest locate most of their nests in hardwoods, and weak excavators are more likely to use hardwoods (fig. 2). Many studies summarized are from locations where hardwoods comprise less than 5 percent of the tree stems, yet cavity nesters often chose decay-prone hardwoods for > 80 percent of their nest sites. Studies reporting both use and availability permit estimates of selection for specific tree species. The most consistently preferred species were trembling aspen, western larch (Larix occidentalis), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa; table 3). Primary cavity nesters favored trembling aspen, while secondary nesters tended to favor western larch and western redcedar (Thuja plicata). Lodgepole pine and true firs (Abies sp.) were least favored as cavity nesting sites. Although black-backed and three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) often concentrate their foraging in beetle-ridden lodgepole pine (Goggans and others 1989; Machmer and Steeger), 4 they still seek aspen for nesting (fig. 2). Exceptions exist. Bull and others (1996) reported that all cavities used by Vaux's swift (Chaetura vauxi) were in grand fir (Abies grandis). In montane forests of south central British Columbia, all 21 nests of three-toed woodpeckers were in subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; Klenner and  Huggard 1997). 5   Comparisons between areas reveal that preference for hardwood nest trees is sometimes flexible. In the interior of British Columbia, Harestad and Keisker (1989) reported that all 243 nests of primary excavators found occurred in hardwoods, despite the fact that hardwood cover comprised only 5 percent of their study area (which was dominated by Douglas-fir). In coastal Oregon and British Columbia, the identical species nested mainly in Douglas-fir and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla; Bunnell andAllaye-Chan 1984, Mannan andothers 1980). Flammulated owls (Otus flammeolus) exhibit similar changes over their range. Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir were used where prevalent (Bull and others 1990, Reynolds and Linkhart 1987, van Woudenberg 1992), but elsewhere the owl nested in oaks (Quercus spp.) and trembling aspen (Marcot andHill 1980, Webb 1982).\n\nFlexibility is not universal. Although some sapsuckers select hardwoods for 80 to 95 percent of their nest sites, other woodpeckers are more emphatically restricted to conifers (fig. 2). Throughout its range, only 9 of 167 white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus) nests have been reported from hardwoods. The restriction is a product of a diet high in ponderosa pine seeds (Dixon 1995a, Ligon 1973). Diet also may limit black-backed and three-toed woodpeckers to coniferous nest sites unless hardwood species are present in small inclusions (appendix A). Weaker excavators that nest and forage in conifers are potentially threatened by forest practices because the conifers may not become old and decayed enough to be susceptible to excavation. In fact, these species (black-backed, Lewis's, three-toed, and white-headed woodpecker) are listed \"at risk\" in one or more jurisdictions of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nPatterns of selection of tree species reflect decay patterns. All cavity nesters appear to seek pockets of heart rot (Bunnell andAllaye-Chan 1984, Kilham 1971), but weaker excavators tend to seek trees exhibiting more advanced decay (Bunnell and others 1999). When nesting in hardwoods, bird species tend to use less visibly decayed trees than when nesting in conifers (Bunnell and others 1999). This pattern reflects both earlier onset of heart rot in hardwoods (Cline 1977, Harmon 1982), and poor applicability to hardwoods of decay classes developed for conifers. Current decay classes apply poorly to hardwoods, because hardwoods show fewer external signs of decay when decay is present. Phellinus ignarius can invade live aspen, softening the heartwood, while the sapwood remains unaffected and the tree shows no external sign of decay. As a result, cavity nesters are more likely to excavate living hardwoods than living conifers.\n\nWeak and strong excavators use live trees differently. Weak excavators show no change in the proportion of live trees selected as the proportion of hardwood nest trees changes. Most nests (78 percent) were in dead trees regardless of the tree species used (Bunnell and others 2002). Strong excavators make significantly greater use of live trees as the percentage of nest sites in hardwoods increases (P < 0.001 across the nine species of strong excavators included in fig. 2, after percentages are arcsine transformed). We conclude that primary excavators select for sites easy to excavate. Generally, that means hardwoods such as aspen, cottonwood and birch (Betula spp.). More decay-prone hardwood species are selected over more decay-resistant species (e.g., Brush and others 1983). Where hardwood species are not common, birds excavate conifers, preferring those in which the heartwood is rotting. Smaller, weaker excavators, such as chickadees and nuthatches, sometimes seek decay-softened sapwood (Lundquist andMariani 1991, Steeger andHitchcock 1998). The pattern of selection of living and dead nest trees suggests that moribund hardwoods can substitute for conifer snags.\n\nThe largest denning mammals rarely find hardwoods big enough to accommodate them, but almost half of fisher den sites were in hardwoods, generally large cottonwood (table 4). The strong selection of hardwood roost trees, usually aspen, by some bats is not simply a product of their distribution. In at least some areas, bats actively seek out scattered hardwoods (Crampton andBarclay 1995, Vonhoff 1996). Although fewer mammal than bird species rely on hardwoods for cavity sites, hardwoods appear critical to some mammals (table 4).\n\nA significant portion of the vertebrate fauna in western forests shows affinities with hardwoods. Bunnell and others (1999) reported that across forest types of British Columbia, 19 to 31 percent of forest-dwelling bird species located two-thirds or more of their nests in hardwoods. The degree to which trembling aspen is favored by primary cavity nesters (table 3) may be especially significant, because these species create cavities for other species. Although most vertebrates associated with hardwoods are birds, some amphibians, shrews, and bats are more abundant where hardwoods are more common. Because the contribution of hardwoods to vertebrate richness is vastly disproportionate to their relative abundance, it is important to maintain hardwoods in the forest.\n\nWhere forestry has been practiced longer than in the Pacific Northwest, trends are clear. A large portion of the species listed as endangered in Sweden are endangered because the original hardwood forest has been converted to conifers (Bernes 1994). Britain faces a similar situation. Holmes (1996) noted that about 400 insect species are associated with \"the English oak\" (Quercus robur). The decline of oaks and other hardwoods in Great Britain has meant that 14 bat species find both their roost sites and forage diminished (Holmes 1996). Of the 90 forest-dwelling vertebrates in the Pacific Northwest designated by state and provincial agencies as \"sensitive\" or \"at risk,\" 17 nest primarily in deciduous trees and 5 in deciduous shrubs. Other listed species, such as sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus), also seek hardwoods to forage.\n\nFrom our review of vertebrate relations with hardwood species, we conclude that managers charged with sustaining biological richness should implement the following management practices:\n\n• Retain hardwoods and manage at least some as desired trees, rather than as competition with crop trees-Small amounts of hardwoods intermixed with conifers serve to increase the richness of birds, bryophytes, and lichens, but there is no apparent need to retain deciduous trees in every stand. Vegetation management in young stands should not remove all hardwood stems. Instead, brushing should be of variable intensity through a block, or focused on those trees directly interfering with coniferous crop trees. A component of hardwood stems should be retained intentionally and managed to become mature trees. Hardwood snags are less durable than conifer snags and cannot substitute completely for conifers. • Avoid conversion of riparian areas to conifers-Hardwoods often do better in riparian areas and little effort is required to promote them there. Hardwoods provide a number of values, including cavity sites younger than conifers, and tend to be more wind-firm than are conifers.\n\n• Encourage upland patches of hardwoods in areas where sustaining biodiversity is a priority-Several vertebrates are closely associated with hardwoods, particularly aspen, willow (Salix spp.), or cottonwood in riparian areas. Other vertebrate species appear to benefit, but are more flexible in their requirements. Inclusions of > 15 percent aspen stems in upland areas significantly increases bird richness (fig. 1), and small patches sustain a variety of other organisms (Ås 1993;Hazell and Gustafsson 1999). Where patches are retained, adjacent areas should not be subject to intensive vegetation management. • Control domestic grazing in riparian areas-In many western regions, hardwoods are concentrated in riparian areas. In riparian areas subject to grazing, declining amounts of hardwoods have affected abundance and distribution of vertebrates (Krueper 1992, Skovline 1984).\n\n4 Unpublished data on file, Pandion Ecological Research, Ltd.; Nelson, BC, Canada.  5 Unpublished data on file, BC Ministry of Forests, Kamloops, BC, Canada.\n\nUSDA Forest Service Gen.
