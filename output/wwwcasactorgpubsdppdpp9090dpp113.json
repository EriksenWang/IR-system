    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, several pricing models that integrate underwriting and investment performance have been proposed or used to determine property4ability insurance rates. In general, these models have been tested separately and only over a relatively limited time horizon. In this article, the major property-liability insurance pricing models are evaluated over the 60-year period from 1926 through 1985 and the results of the various models are compared in terms of the ability to predict actual underwriting profit margins. Differences between model predictions and realized underwriting profit margin series are examined over the entire period as well as various subperiods in order to demonstrate how individual models perform under different conditions.\nThe goal of this research is to assist actuaries and researchers in the application of pricing models and interpretation of results.",
    "full_text": "Although the standard pricing model of the insurance industry [dating back to the 1921 National Convention of Insurance Commissioners (NCIC) Fire Insurance Committee report] ignores investment income in insurance ratemaking, many insurance pricing models have been proposed that integrate the underwriting and investment income aspects of the insurance contract. These models generally follow one of two paths. Those proposed by insurance practitioners or academics specializing in insurance typically concentrate on the underwriting side of the insurance transaction and select rather arbitrary values for investment income. On the other hand, models developed by financial economists tend to concentrate on the investment aspect of insurance by emphasizing risk-adjusted rates of return on investment while glossing over the specialized characteristics of the underwriting side of the insurance business. More recently, research has been aimed at developing pricing models that adequately address the importance of both underwriting and investment-related issues. The purpose of this article is to compare and contrast the predictive abilities of a number of different insurance pricing models over an extended period in order to demonstrate how various models perform under different economic and competitive conditions. This research will be of assistance to practitioners as well as academics in the application of insurance pricing models and interpretation of results.\n\nAlthough the minority report of the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners (NCIC) Fire Insurance Committee in 1921 proposed that investment income be considered, this recommendation was defeated (see Webb, 1982). This position began to reemerge within the insurance community during the latter part of the 196Os, when interest rates began to increase and to become more volatile. A landmark study by the NAIC in 1970 effectively reopened the issue of investment income in ratemaking by concluding, \"In determining profits, it is submitted that income from all sources should be considered.\"\n\n(see NAIC, 1970, p. 721). Bailey (1976) proposed a method of allocating actual investment income (interest, dividends and realized capital gains) to stockholders and policyholders. Ferrari (1967Ferrari ( , 1968) ) proposed a method of calculating return on equity for insurers based on both underwriting and investment performance and also advanced the investment technique of portfolio theory for use in developing line of business mix strategies. Cooper (1974) extended the use of portfolio theory for insurance applications and developed a model for determining the competitive rate of return on insurance contracts by integrating underwriting and investment performance. In line with the insurance focus, he assumed that the investment return would be the rate earned on \"riskless or very low risk investments.\"\n\nSeveral other insurance researchers developed sophisticated models of insurance markets that included the effect of investment income, but these studies continued to overlook the complexity of determining a proper value for the investment income. Witt (1973) developed a model of the insurance industry based on monopolistic competition that led to the conclusion that investment income is reflected indirectly in pricing. In another model, Witt (1974) includes investment income as a stochastic variable that is normally distributed with a known mean and standard deviation and is uncorrelated with insurance claims. Kahane and Levy (1975) incorporate an arbitrary investment return in their detailed model of insurance. McCabe and Witt (1980) model insurance behavior on the assumption that the insurer seeks to maximize profit subject to a probability of insolvency constraint. In this model investment performance is estimated by normally distributed random variables for stock and bond returns with means and standard deviations based on historical performance. Spellman, Witt, and Rentz (1975) develop a microeconomic pricing model for insurers, including the effect of investment income, that demonstrates the impact of the elasticity of demand for insurance on the profit maximizing price markup above marginal costs. One key difficulty with the use of these insurance based pricing models is in selecting an appropriate value for investment returns. In general these models do not provide for any risk adjustment for the investment side of the insurance contract. The investment income value tends to be selected from historical values or arbitrarily. The magnitude of investment income for insurers has led to an alternative focus for insurance pricing.\n\nThe alternative focus on insurance pricing, brought by financial economists, concentrated on the investment aspect of the insurance transaction and oversimplified the underwriting side. Quirin and Waters (1975) concluded that insurers could, in effect, borrow at a negative interest rate. Walter (1979) observed that the market value of insurer stocks exceeded the book value and concluded that insurance regulation fostered excess profitability. Fairley (1979) concentrated on the historical systematic risk level of underwriting and, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), proposed a formula for establishing insurance prices that was utilized in Massachusetts for several years before it was shown that the model did not reflect insurance taxation appropriately.\n\nMore recent research has brought equal attention to both the financial issues involved in determining investment rates of return and the unique characteristics of the insurance contract. Turner (1987) and Ang and Lai (1987) demonstrate that the CAPM focus on systematic risk ignores an important factor in insurance pricing. Cummins and Harrington (1988) determine that insurer stock returns are consistent with the CAPM model only for part of their tested experience period and that unsystematic risk is a relevant factor in determining rates of return. Witt and Urrutia (1983) develop measures of systematic and unsystematic underwriting risk and compare the impact of rate regulation on the allocation. D'Arcy (1988) demonstrates that the risk-free rate commonly used to discount loss reserves may be excessive given the characteristics of insurance contracts. Derrig (1985) combines applicable tax provisions for insurers with financial pricing models. Following this line of research, this article attempts to provide an equal focus on the underwriting and investment sides of the insurance transaction by testing pricing models that have been derived from both the insurance and financial economics areas over a consistent period.\n\nBoth the history of insurance rate regulation and the development of property-liability insurance pricing models have been dealt with effectively in prior literature (e.g., see Cooper, 1974;D'Arcy and Doherty, 1988;and NAIC, 1970). Thus, this material will simply be summarized and referenced here. Prior to the 197Os, the standard pricing practice incorporated an independently selected underwriting profit margin into the ratemaking formula. The selection of a 5 percent underwriting profit margin dates back to 1921, but even then it was not supported on the basis of any numerical calculation. As interest rates rose in the late 197Os, emphasis shifted to the total rate of return, rather than simply the underwriting profit margin (see Biger and Kahane, 1978;D'Arcy, 1983;Haugen and Kroncke, 1971;Plotkin, 1979;Quirin and Waters, 1975;and Venezian, 1983). Some insurers developed a total rate of return model that backed into the appropriate underwriting profit margin by including consideration of the expected investment income.\n\nAcademics and regulators introduced the CAPM and discounted cash flow analysis into rate hearings (see Cummins and Chang, 1983;Cummins and Harrington, 1985;Fairley, 1979;Hill, 1979;Hill and Modigliani, 1987;and Myers and Cohn, 1987). More recently, the arbitrage pricing model has been applied to insurance pricing (see Kraus and Ross, 1982;andUrrutia, 1987a and1987b) and the option pricing model has been applied to both pricing and solvency considerations (see Cummins, 1988;Derrig, 1989;and Doherty and Garven, 1986). Although these models differ widely in terms of underlying assumptions, parameter specifications, and methods of calculation, they are generally organized around the basic principle that certain targets must be met so as to justify continued or even further allocation of capital to a particular set of insurance activities. Discovery of a viable pricing model does not imply that regulation should then be enforced requiring insurers to charge the rate indicated by the selected pricing model. This action would make no more sense than requiring stock trades to take place at the price determined by the latest stock pricing model. Competitive markets will tend to drive profit margins toward the theoretically correct level. Regulating the \"correct\" rate level would then he unnecessary. This research is aimed at providing insight for the participants in the market, both as buyers and sellers of insurance, to increase the availability of information about profitability and the degree of competition in insurance markets.\n\nThe insurance pricing models tested in this article include the target underwriting profit margin, target total rate of return, CAPM, discounted cash flow model and option pricing model. Other models have been proposed, but are not included in this study due either to data availability problems or the fact that they have not been widely applied.\n\nModels not tested include the National Council on Compensation Insurance ratemaking methodology and the mean-standard deviation model (see Venezian, 1983).\n\nThe following section provides a brief overview of the intuition and mathematical structure underlying the alternative ratemaking models tested.\n\nThen data and methodology are discussed, followed by empirical results. Conclusions from the study are then drawn and directions for future research are indicated.\n\nTaTget Underwriting Profit Margin\n\nThe target underwriting profit margin ratemaking technique seeks to achieve a predetermined underwriting profit margin without regard to investment income, insurer leverage or level of risk. The standard underwriting profit margins are 2.5 percent for workers' compensation and 5.0 percent for all other lines. These margins evolved from a 1921 National Convention of Insurance Commissioners (NCIC) Fire Insurance Committee report that indicated that \"5 percent is the minimum percentage which can be regarded as 'a reasonable underwriting profit'\" (see Webb, 1982). No statistical support has ever been provided for the selected level. McCullough (1948) provides an in depth analysis of the 1921 NCIC deliberations and a update of the issue through 1947, with additional insight into the consideration of investment income in ratemaking.\n\nMany researchers dismiss the standard profit formula levels as taken out of thin air and utterly without meaning. However, this may be an excessively harsh view. The members of the NCIC committee included both regulators and industry representatives.\n\nThey had access to the experience of a large number of insurers. This experience was derived from a period of low interest rates (e.g., long term bond yields were approximately 4 to 5 percent) and fast payouts of insurance losses. Although they were developing a profit standard for fire insurance only, property lines were predominate in the industry.\n\nThe experience of the time may have indicated that a 5 percent level was appropriate.\n\nSelection of a profit margin that was not supported by the available experience simply would not have been approved by a majority of the committee. Thus, this 5 percent level may in fact represent a value derived from a specific era which may or may not be appropriate in other periods or for different lines of insurance. Therefore, although it lacks a coherent theoretical foundation, the target underwriting profit margin method is probably not entirely without merit.\n\nTarget Total Rate of Return\n\nThe first attempts to combine investment income with underwriting profit margins involved developing a target total rate of return for insurers similar to the target total rate of return for utilities (see Cooper, 1974;and Ferrari, 1968). The total return generated from investments and from underwriting combined were set equal to a target. After the investment income is forecasted, the required underwriting profit margin can be calculated.\n\nThe formula for the target total rate of return can be represented as follows:\n\nwhere TRR = (IA/S)(IRR) + (P/S)(UPM),\n\nTR.R = target total rate of return; IA = investable assets; s = surplus; IRR = investment rate of return; P = premium; UPM = underwriting profit margin.\n\nThe primary problem involved in using this technique is determining the appropriate target for the total rate of return. When applied to public utility firms, a similar problem arises, but this is handled setting the target equal to the weighted average cost of capital.\n\nUtilities have two sources of capital: debt and equity. The cost of debt is typically determined by averaging the interest rates on outstanding issues with the expected rate on\n\nAnnual values for the right hand parameters can be obtained from historical experience and the underwriting profit margin determined from the total rate of return model can then be compared with actual underwriting profit margins.\n\nThe CAPM, defined in equation ( 2), has been applied to insurance by Fairley (1979), Hill (1979) and Hill and Modigliani (1987) Based on this form of the model, the insurer credits the funds generated from the insurance transaction at a risk-free rate which is offset by the required rate of return based on the systematic risk of the underwriting transaction. The funds generated by writing insurance result from the lag between the receipt of premium and the payment of expenses and losses that occurs with many types of insurance. The insurer is expected to credit these balances with the risk-free rate, although the insurer may elect to invest in a more risky asset with a higher expected return. If this is done, any excess return, or below risk-free rate achieved, would be borne by the insurer. On the underwriting component of profitability, in competitive financial markets, insurers would only be rewarded for assuming systematic, or undiversifiable, risk. Thus, the systematic risk of underwriting would be measured and the insurer entitled to offset the risk-free rate payout with the appropriate risk adjusted rate of return of the transaction.\n\nThe insurance CAPM model described in equation ( 4) does not include the effect of taxes. Fairley revised this model to include a provision for taxes, but that model did not account for the differential tax treatment of underwriting income and investment income due to dividend exclusions, tax free investments and capital gains taxation. Hill and Modigliani (1987) developed an insurance CAPM that allows for differential tax rates.2\n\nThis model can be written as follows:\n\nwhere UPM = -krf(l--7J/(l-7) + tL(E(r&-If) + (S/P)n(7,/(1-7)), ra= tax rate on investment income; r = tax rate on underwriting income.\n\n(5)\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe discounted cash flow model was developed by Myers and Cohn (1987) for the 1982 Massachusetts automobile rate hearings as a counterpart to the CAPM approach. Since 1982, this approach has been used as the basis for setting automobile insurance rates in that state (see Derrig, 1987) applying a tax rate that approximated the maximum corporate tax rate to the difference between the indicated premiums and the losses (including expenses). As these were undiscounted values, the underwriting income tended to be negative, in which case the technique assumed that the underwriting losses were offsetting other taxable income.\n\nThe procedure for determining the tax on investment income involved allocating surplus to the premium income and combining the surplus with the unpaid losses and expenses to determine an aggregate investment level. Technically, the proper surplus allocation is the ratio of surplus to the net present value of the cash flows emanating from the contract, which include losses and loss adjustment expenses, general expenses and the taxes accruing from underwriting and investments.\n\nIn Massachusetts, this ratio is promulgated by the insurance commissioner. However, since the present value of the premiums is expected to equal the present value of all the cash flows [as shown in equation (g)], the ratio of surplus to net written premiums is often used as an approximation for this allocation.\n\nSeveral minor adjustments will be made to the Myers-Cohn approach as applied in this article. Some adjustments are made to accommodate a difference in notation to be consistent with the remainder of the article. Others represent a timing difference that occurs based on the different data sources used to obtain the information used in the respective studies. Additionally, all cash flows will be discounted based on the risk-free rate. This would be equivalent to applying an underwriting beta of zero, which is one of the alternatives tested for the CAPM methodology. The discounted cash flow model tested in this study is:\n\nE = expenses other than loss adjustment expenses; L = losses and loss adjustment expenses.\n\nBy dividing through by the premium P, equation ( 7) can be rewritten:\n\nwhere ER = expense ratio; LR = loss ratio; 7 = tax rate; SL = ratio of surplus to premiums; LPP = loss payout pattern.\n\nThe premium payment pattern on the historical data is not known and most likely changes over time. In general, insurers will collect premium income either when the policy is written or in installments over the policy period. In many cases the insurance agent actually collects the premium 30 to 60 days prior to submitting it to the insurer. However, this delay represents a form of compensation to the agent, although the foregone interest is not properly reported as a commission expense. This delay should not affect the proper premium determination. During much of the period studied, policy terms tended to be for either annual or three-year periods, with annual installments. Assuming the premiums were paid at the beginning of the coverage period, or of the year, the premiums would be received by the insurer or its agent one six months prior to the average coverage period.\n\nAs interest rates rose during the 197Os, insurers adopted shorter policy periods and developed some contracts that delayed the receipt of premiums (such as paid loss retrospective contracts), but these developments would only affect the last few years of the sample period. Thus, it will be assumed that a six-month delay occurs between the receipt of premium and the middle of the coverage period.\n\nInsurers do not maintain expense allocation records that assign expenses, other than loss adjustment expenses, to individual policies. Instead these expenses tend to be allocated to lines of business. The expense ratio for a given line of business is determined by dividing the expenses, other than loss adjustment expenses, for a given line of business by the premiums written in that line during the same period. In many cases, expenses such as commissions, premium taxes, and policy record keeping costs are incurred simultaneously with the writing of the policy. Other expenses, such as those for policy development and ratemaking, would occur before a policy was written. Some other expenses, including policyholder service, would be incurred after the policy is written.\n\nLacking reliable information about the true timing of expenses, it will be assumed that, on average, expenses are incurred when the policy is written. Thus, there is no time lag between collecting the premium and paying expenses.\n\nThe other notable feature of expenses for the purpose of this test is the calculation of expenses given the premium level indicated by the discounted cash flow approach.\n\nTheoretically, the premium level is determined by discounting the expenses, losses and tax\n\npayments, but the level of expenses is based on the premium level. Commissions and premium taxes, which make up approximately one half of the expenses, are directly proportional to the premium income. Other expenses, such as salaries and advertising, could also adjust in line with premium income. Additionally, agent compensation in the form of interest earned on premium balances is not reflected in traditional expense ratios.\n\nTo avoid adding an additional step and further assumptions in the determination, the actual expense ratio achieved by insurers during the sample period will be used to represent the expenses in this model. To the extent that the indicated premium level diverges from the actual premium level, this will be inaccurate. However, the inaccuracy is tempered by the fact that if the premium level charged had been the indicated, and not the actual level, then expenses would have adjusted partially to compensate for this difference.\n\nThe loss ratio is the nominal, undiscounted loss and loss adjustment expense value divided by earned premium. This is the value to be solved for in equation ( 8). As the expense ratio is assumed to be the historical value, and values for the other parameters can be estimated, then LR is the only unknown in the equation. Once LR is determined, then the indicated underwriting profit margin can be determined by subtracting the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio from unity.\n\nThe option pricing model has only recently been applied directly to property-liability insurance and to ratemaking in particular.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, the main applications of option pricing techniques to the pricing of property-liability insurance are those of Cummins (19881, Derrig (1989) and Doherty and Garven (1986). Cummins derives a continuous time/jump process model for valuing the liabilities of solvency guarantee schemes. Although his model is not explicitly applied to ratemaking, it could be adapted for this purpose. Derrig's objectives are somewhat different. He is concerned with the estimation of solvency probabilities, surplus levels by line, and risk premium loadings.\n\nDoherty and Garven are directly concerned with derivation of the competitive or fair insurance price and, for this reason, the following discussion summarizes their approach.\n\nThe rationale for applying the option pricing model to the pricing of insurance is that the payoffs received by the insurer's various claimholders are isomorphic to the payoffs on options. For the sake of example, consider the case of a stock insurer in which the three Given equations ( 9), ( 10) and (ll), the objective is to price the insurance policies such that the shareholders receive a fair rate of return on their equity investment in the insurance firm. As in the case of the insurance CAPM, the fair rate of return is that which would be earned in a competitive capital market. Such a return would be made for Furthermore, P* may be translated into the underwriting profit margin by the routine solution of equation ( 13):\n\n(13)\n\nThe option pricing model has several practical advantages over the CAPM. First, it avoids the need for estimating and using underwriting betas. Secondly, the option pricing model addresses the effects of insolvency and tax shield redundancy on the fair rate of return, while the CAPM assumes that these effects are negligible. The work undertaken here reveals that the tax effects especially have a significant impact on the results.\n\nTesting property-liability insurance pricing models historically is extremely difficult, which most likely explains why only limited tests have been performed. Data availability problems are significant. Because several of the models require data that are not regularly reported, many assumptions had to be made in testing these models over the sample period. The validity of these assumptions is obviously critical in determining the applicability of the models and valid criticisms of these assumptions can be raised.\n\nHowever, the authors believe that the assumed values represent the best possible estimates of the necessary parameters. While they are recognized as not being completely accurate, no better values are known to be available. If these tests are to be performed, they must necessarily be done with less than perfect input values. For the option pricing model, the indicated underwriting profit margin is a function of individual insurers' premium to surplus ratios, which will not be the same as the aggregate value.\n\nThe primary data source for insurance industry information was Best's Awegates & Averamx Several problems with the use of this data source arise. Industry figures reported are aggregate values for all insurers. As some insurers are owned by others, aggregate figures include some double counting of surplus and other values. Consolidated figures, which avoid this double counting, are only available for the years since 1983. For consistency, aggregate figures were used for all years so that any errors introduced by this assumption would be included over the entire sample period.\n\nAnother problem with this data source is that incurred losses constitute calendar year rather than accident year values. Any reserving changes would distort the calendar year results. Numerous researchers have demonstrated that loss reserve adequacy changes over time and the degree of adequacy is correlated with interest rates (see Anderson, 1971;Balcarek, 1972;Forbes, 1984;Smith, 1980;and Weiss, 1985). Unfortunately, accurate accident year experience for the industry is only available for the last seven years of the sample period. Thus, again for consistency, calendar year values are used throughout the period. The only mitigating factor for this assumption is that regulators, the insurance press, and many insurance managers tend to concentrate on calendar year values, increasing the importance of this value for pricing purposes. Over the entire sample period, the changes in loss reserve adequacy will tend to cancel out (the distortions in calendar year values caused by inaccurate reserving will be offset by errors in the opposite direction as the losses are settled in later years) so that the mean values of the actual results and model values will not be distorted by this substitution, but individual years' results will be affected by this problem.\n\nLoss payout patterns for the entire sample period are not available. Over the ten years for which these data are available, the by line results are remarkably stable.\n\nAssuming this stability occurs over the entire sample period, loss payout patterns are generated for earlier years based on line of business distributions.\n\nPredictions generated by several of the models tend to be quite sensitive to tax-related assumptions. No useful information on the marginal tax rate of the industry is published. This study assumes that the applicable tax rate is the maximum corporate income tax rate excluding excess profits taxes. However, the sensitivity of these models to this parameter and the significant impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to insurance industry taxation indicate the importance of more research on the effective tax rate for the insurance industry.\n\nIn addition to the problems involved in obtaining usable data, several potential econometric problems may exist. The goodness of fit tests rely on the assumption that forecast errors are uncorrelated with economic variables such as interest rates. Some research suggests that reserve adequacy and other factors that affect insurance profitability are correlated with economic variables (see Fields and Venezian (1989;Venezian (1988a and1988b), and Weiss (1985)). To the extent that this correlation occurs, the evaluations of the different models may be subject to error. Furthermore, underwriting profit margins for stock insurers for all lines combined are used in this study. However, insurers set rates The tax rate applied to underwriting income is the maximum corporate tax rate each year, including excess profits taxes, as reported by Seater (1980). The tax rate on investment income used in this study is 50 percent of the tax rate on underwriting income.\n\nAlthough the tax rate on investments would vary depending on the portfolio mix and realization of gains and losses, information necessary to determine the investment tax rate is not available for most of the period analyzed. Beginning in 1983, a consolidated industry For the discounted cash flow model, the present value factor for the loss ratio is determined from loss payout patterns reported in Wall (1987). His study covers the period The tax generated on underwriting income is determined by multiplying the maximum corporate tax rate for each year, excluding excess profits taxes due to both the assumed temporary nature of these taxes and their extremely high levels, by the underwriting profit margin. As it is assumed that written premium precedes earned premium by six months, and the taxes are incurred when the underwriting profits are earned, then the underwriting 13.5\n\ntaxes are discounted by the risk-free interest rate for six months.\n\nThe tax generated on income from the investment balance is also determined based on the loss payout pattern described by Woll (1987). For each year the investable loss reserves as a percentage of the loss ratio are determined by averaging the beginning and ending values for the proportion of losses unpaid, calculated separately for Schedule 0 and P lines and then combined. This represents the average investment balance derived from loss (and loss adjustment expense) reserves. Additionally, surplus that supports these reserves is also invested and incurs taxation.* To account for this additional investment, the loss reserve investment balance is multiplied by one plus the ratio of surplus to net written premium for the industry, determined from Best's &grenates & Averages for all stock property-liability insurers for the year the policies are written. The entire investment balance is multiplied by the risk-free interest rate for the year the policies were written. The investment income is assumed to accrue equally over the year (actually it would be more heavily weighted toward the beginning of the year when the largest amount is available to invest; instead assume a level amount invested over the entire year), thus the tax would be incurred halfway through the year. Thus, the present value of the tax is determined by discounting the tax by the runoff year number less one half.\n\nCombining the steps described above into equation ( 8) leaves an equation with one unknown, LR, which can then be solved. The indicated underwriting profit margin is determined by subtracting the actual expense ratio and the indicated loss ratio from unity.\n\nThe values used in the option pricing model are as follows:\n\nInitial Equity 1.000 Standard Deviation of Claims Costs .2958 Correlation Between Investment Returns and Claims Costs .0763 Tax Adjustment Parameter .5000 Market Risk Premium .0855 Standard Deviation of Market Return .2137\n\nThe values for the funds generating coefficient, risk-free rate of interest and statutory tax rate all vary by year and are determined as described previously. The expected claims cost, beta of the investment portfolio, and standard deviation of the investment portfolio also vary by year. These values, and the parameter values not used in prior models, are determined as follows :\n\n1)\n\n2)\n\n7)\n\nThe expected claims costs is the ratio of incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses to surplus for stock insurers for each year.\n\nThe standard deviation of expected claim costs is the standard deviation of the ratio described above over the period 1926 through 1985.\n\nThe correlation between the investment returns and claim costs is the correlation for the period 1926 through 1985.\n\nThe beta of the investment portfolio is the actual beta for investment profit or loss based on the 1926 through 1985 period. The alternative value is the weighted average beta for stock insurers based on their portfolio distribution among bonds, preferred stock and common stock each year. The bond beta was determined from the Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1986) data to be 3.64 percent over the entire 1926 through 1985 period.\n\nThe preferred stock beta was determined from S&P data to be 14.78 percent over the period 1931 through 1981, the only years the necessary information to determine rates of return was available.\n\nFrom portfolio theory, it is well known that the standard deviation of a well diversified portfolio is proportional to the standard deviation of the market, the factor of proportionality being beta. Therefore, the standard deviation of the investment portfolio is determined in this manner on a yearly basis.\n\nThe standard deviation of the market is the standard deviation of common stock returns for the period 1926 through 1985.\n\nVarious criteria exist for evaluating the accuracy of the forecasts generated by a predictive model. This study uses the mean square error criterion as developed by Theil (1966).\n\nThe mean square error (MSE) of a prediction is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere At is the actual and Pt is the predicted value of a variable in period t. Since this measure is zero in the case of perfect forecasts, predictive models which yield low mean square errors have greater forecast accuracy than do models with high mean square errors.\n\nA related measure of forecast accuracy is given by Theil's U statistic:\n\nu=rjyT\n\nAs is the case with mean square error, Theil's U assumes a value of zero in the case of perfect forecasts. Also, Theil's U standardizes mean square error as a function of both the level and variability of the actual underwriting profit margin series, thereby facilitating comparison of predictive models over time as well as within various subperiods. Since the objective is to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the various property-liability insurance pricing models in this manner, this study reports Theil's U as well as mean square error.\n\nNext, raw data and summary statistics for realized underwriting profits and model predictions are evaluated on a model-by-model basis. This is followed by an analysis of mean square error and Theil's U statistics.\n\nTarget Undenvrdting Profit Margin: The actual and predicted underwriting profit margin series are listed in Table 1 for 1926 through 1985 and presented graphically in Figures 123456789. Also, summary statistics are reported in Table 2 and presented graphically in Figure 10. In Table 1, the first and second columns list the year and actual (ACT)\n\nunderwriting profit margin series. The third column lists target underwriting profit margin (TARG) predictions obtained by weighting the 2.5 percent and 5.0 percent profit standards according to the historical evolution of the industry's premium distribution.\n\nA cursory examination of these data indicates that the target underwriting profit margin is (not surprisingly) insensitive to changes in economic conditions and, since 1956, does not even fall within the range of actual underwriting profit margins. Interestingly, in spite of the obvious theoretical shortcomings of this method, the average actual underwriting profit margin from 1926 through 1955 was 4.65 percent, just .lO percentage points lower than the average target underwriting profit margin. Over the entire sample period, the average target underwriting profit margin was 4.73 percent, 3.41 percentage points higher than the average actual underwriting profit margin of 1.32 percent. Thus, although this method may have once had some validity, it is obviously not realistic under the market conditions which have prevailed throughout most of the postwar period.\n\nTarget Total Rate of Return: The predicted underwriting profit margins for the total rate of return methodology, based upon various parameter assumptions, are listed in columns 4 through 9 of Table 1 and  Option Pricing Model: The predicted underwriting profit margins based upon the option pricing model are listed in columns 13 through 18 of Table 1 and graphed in Figures 8 and 9. The OlR series listed in column 13 is based upon the normal option pricing model, while the 02R series in column 16 makes use of the lognormal option pricing model.\n\nThe standard deviations for these models are quite close to the standard deviation of the actual return series; i.e., 5.30 percent and 5.51 percent for OlR and 02R compared with 5.74 percent for the actual return series. However, unlike the previous models, OlR and 02R tend to systematically overestimate the actual return series. This propensity toward overestimation is especially evident from 1950 through 1976, when all deviations between predicted and actual returns were positive for both models. This result largely derives from the fact that these models implicitly assume that tax shields can be fully utilized by the insurer only when the terminal (next period) value of its assets exceeds the value of its tax shields. In states of the world where the terminal value of the insurer's assets is less than the value of its tax shields, these option models assume that those tax shields which are not utilized expire worthless. Since wasted tax shields effectively increase the burden of the corporate tax upon the insurer, higher underwriting profit margin estimates are produced during this period by OlR and 02R than by alternative financial pricing models such as CAPl, CAPB, and DCF which implicitly assume either that tax shields are always fully utilized or that the tax system provides for the contemporaneous realization of tax rebates as well as liabilities.11\n\nSince the OlR and 02R models determine upper bounds for the effect of underutilized tax shields on the underwriting profit margin, two alternative option models, OlN and 02N, were devised so as to produce option pricing estimates under the same tax assumptions as are implicitly assumed by the CAPl, CAPP, and DCF models; viz., assume that tax shields are never underutilized. Consequently, the estimates generated by OlN and 02N represent lower bounds for the effect of underutilized tax shields on the underwriting profit margin.12 The primary difference between the OlN and 02N models and the CAP1 and CAP2 models is due to the fact that the option models endogenize the probability of insolvency, whereas the CAPM models implicitly assume that either the probability of insolvency is negligible or that shareholders have unlimited liability.\n\nInterestingly, the OlN and 02N series are very close to being perfectly positively correlated with the CAP1 and CAP2 series. 13 Furthermore, these two models also share the tendency of the CAP1 and CAP2 models to underestimate the true return series. Since the only structural difference between the OlR/02R and OlN/02N models is due to tax assumptions, a third set of option-related models, OlC and 02C, was devised by forming linear combinations of the OlR/OlN models and OZR/OZN models which minimize mean square error as measured over the sample period.14\n\nAnalysis of Mean Square Error and Theirs U\n\nThe mean square errors and Theil's U statistics for the various models described in the previous section are listed in Tables 3 and 4 for the entire sample period and various subperiods, and Theil's U statistics are graphed for the entire sample period in Figure 11.\n\nBased on these data, the relative performance of the different models can be assessed.\n\nOver the entire period, the TRR6 model produced the lowest mean square error and Theil's The results of these tests indicate that the higher rankings usually tend to go to the total rate of return and option pricing models. This is especially true during the second half of the sample period as nominal interest rates began to rise significantly.\n\nUnfortunately, relative rankings of the alternative models are not very stable over time.\n\nAlso, in spite of the fact that capital asset, discounted cash flow and option pricing models use more variables than the target and total rate of return models, this does not always translate into greater predictive accuracy. It may be that the estimation process itself has introduced error of a sufficiently high order of magnitude so as to turn the theoretical advantages of these models into disadvantages. For example, the predictions generated by the target and total rate of return models are not at all sensitive to assumptions concerning values taken on by tax-related parameters. However, the capital asset, discounted cash flow and the option pricing models require explicit recognition of taxes and are therefore sensitive to errors in the estimation of these parameters. Furthermore, the option models are particularly sensitive to changes in the tax related parameters. Thus, further testing of the relative merits of the various pricing models may need to await a more extensive development of an historical database on the taxation of insurers.\n\nOverall, the CAPM approaches do not predict the actual returns well until the period from 1956 through 1965, and even then they do not outperform the option pricing models Finally, the analysis in this article is based on data for stock insurers only. Although stock companies dominate the property-liability insurance industry, there are also many firms which employ alternative ownership structures (e.g., mutuals, reciprocals, Lloyds, and captives). Future research aimed at these market segments and the interaction among them would be helpful if data limitations could be overcome.\n\nNotes 1.\n\n3.\n\n5.\n\n10.\n\nAlthough the CAPM formula is used to calculate E(r& the total rate of return method does not depend on the CAPM, as other techniques could be used to obtain E&J.\n\nAlthough the arbitrage pricing model is not tested in this study, Urrutia (1987a and1987b) also applied a differential tax rate in his tests of that model.\n\nAs in the case of the total rate of return model, while the appropriate discount rate may be calculated from the CAPM formula, the Myers-Cohn model does not preclude the choice of other techniques.\n\nSince P is received at the beginning of the period and is therefore known with certainty, PV(P) is determined by discounting P at the risk-free rate.\n\nMyers showed in the 1985 Massachusetts automobile rate hearings that the risk adjusted present value of the investment tax liability for a fixed effective tax rate is the same for all asset portfolios. Consequently, the correct value for PV(IBT) is obtained by discounting the tax liability at the risk-free rate. See Derrig (1985) for a review of Myers' proof.\n\nThe reader is referred to Doherty and Garven (1986) for details concerning the derivation and mathematical structure of their models.\n\nThe reader is referred to the appendix for details on how these values were calculated.\n\nInsurers 11. Closer inspection of applicable tax rates and nominal rates of interest during 1950 through 1976 and the years immediately preceding and followin this period provides some clues as to why the OlR and 02R estimates were so 43 kgh. Prior to 1950 specifically, during 1926 through 1949)' the average tti rate was 23.7 percent. owever., during 1950 through 1976, tax rates averaged 50.13 percent. This substantial increase in tax rates increased the value of the hypothetically wasted tax shields, thereby causing the prediction error to be too high. Although tax rates remained relatively high during 1977 through 1985 (averaging 47.11 percent), substantial increases in nominal rates of interest during that period lowered the probabilities of tax shield underutilization for the two option models, thereby lessening the impact of wasted tax shields on the predictions generated by these models.\n\n12. As a practical matter, tax shields which are not utilized in one period can be carried back and forward if necessary. Under federal tax law, losses only produce contemporaneous tax rebates under the condition that income from previous years is adequate to fully offset loss carrybacks. When this is not the case! losses are carried forward at a zero rate of interest, and beyond a certain point in time, carryforwards that are not utilized expire. Consequently, the present value of a tax rebate from a loss carryforward is worth less than a contemporaneous tax rebate for two reasons: 1 carryforwards do not earn interest, and 2) the insurer may not produce enoug l! income in future periods to use the carryforwards before they expire. By representing the limiting case where tax loss carrybacks or carr forwards are disallowed, the OlR and 02R models determine upper bounds for the e i ect of underutilized tax shields on the underwriting profit margin. Although the effect of the carryback-carryforward provision is not estimated in this article due to data limitations as well as the lack of a viable multiperiod option model of insurance pricing which directly incorporates this provision, its effect can nevertheless be qualitatively inferred. Since the effect of the carryback+arryforward provision is to reduce the burden of wasted tax shields, lower underwriting profit margins would be implied than are predicted by either OlR or 02R. However, one can also be sure for the reasons given above that the implied margins would exceed those predicted by OlN and 02N.\n\n13. Because the implied probabilities of insolvency averaged .Ol percent for normal option model and .12 percent for the lognormal option model durin the entire sample period, the CAPM and OlN k the same models. The correlations b 02N models are structurally very c ose to being etween the CAPM and option models are .9847 in the case of the OlN series and -9684 for the 02N series.\n\n14. The weighting scheme described here involves redefining P t in equation 17 for both the normal and lognormal option models in the following manner:\n\nwhere X corresponds to the weight applied to prediction Pr t, Prt is the period t prediction generated by the option models which assume the possibility of redundant tax shields (i.e., OlR and 02R), and Pst corresponds to the period t rediction generated by the option models which assume nonredundant tax shields i.e., 01N P and 02N). Substituting this definition for Pt into equation ( 17)' differentiating with respect to X, and solving for X when the derivative assumes a value of zero yields the following equation for X:\n\nTax Adjustment Parameter (G)/(E) 1983 6,449 997 996 875 13 11 13 1,330 1,403 1,322 1,361 736 1,057 2,112 3,063 5,483 19,940 21,967 26,255 10,863 10,949 12,415 9,077 11,018 13,840 .455 ,502 ,527 1984 6,436 1985 6,347 Table 3 Mean Square Error (%I Model Time Period 1926-66 1926-66 1966-36 1926-45 1946-66 1966-86 TAR0 0.44 0.13 0.76 TAR1 0.27 0.36 0.19 TRRZ 1.26 1.05 0.36 TARS 0.28 0.27 0.29 TRR4 0.23 0.12 0.34 7RR6 1.06 1.28 0.64 lRR6 0.16 0.11 0.22 CAP, 0.36 0.30 0.53 CAP2 0.24 0.22 0.26 DCF 0.32 0.39 0.26 OIR OIN 0.36 0.43 0.21 0.60 0.31 0.21 0.17 0.63 0.66 0.30 OlC 0.16 0.27 02R 0.26 0.36 02N 0.42 0.20 02c 0.17 0.26 0.14 0.33\", 1.73 0.22 0.08 t.41 0.07 0.30 0.19 0.33 0.14 o.zsa 0.17 0.17 0.4 I 0.19 0.19 I .oo 0.24 0.04 0.1 I 0.23 0.34 1.66 0.26 0.24 0.20 0.46 0.40 0.09 0.08 0.40 ,.I5 0.67 1.46 1.08 I.47 0.33 1.22 0.62 0.22 0.42 0.14 0.29 0.40 0.04 0.24 0.60 0.27 0.34 0.09 0.09 0.13 0.30 0.13 0.44 0.37 o.eo I.42 1.39 1.02 0.73 1.26 0.62 0.17 0.26 0.11 0.03 0.16 0.16 0.10 0.39 0.26 0.48 0.19 0.4, 0.40 0.02 0.23 0.74 0.17 0.36 0.16 0.22 0.30 0.03 0.12 0.68 0.26 0.37 0.29 0.43 0.22 0.47 0.28 0.23 0.26 0.41 0.49 0.03 0.14 0.82 0.14 0.14 0.22 1.01 0.17 0.33 0.32 0.74 0.63 0.03 0.23 0.26 0.13 0.16 0.13 0.36 0.06 1.03 0.16 0.18 0.42 I.04 0.02 0.30 0.41 0.23 0.23 0.69 0.22 0.13 0.21 0.44 0.13 0.12 0.06 0.60 0.40 0.04 0.38 0.64 0.46 0. 38 1926-36 1936-45 1946-65 1956-66 1966-76 1976-36 Note: MSE = itfI(Pt -A#, where At and Pt are the actual and predicted period t values.\n\nTable 4 Theil's U Statistic Model 1926-35 1926-66 1966-36 1926-46 1946-65 1966-66 1926-35 TARG 113.01 60.9 1 TRRl 89.42 101.25 TRRP 189.83 218.60 TRRB 90.26 69.72 TRR4 81.38 66.92 TRRS 174.81 183.44 TRRB 68.40 66.17 CAP1 99.93 103.00 CAP2 132.30 80.96 DCF 95.93 108.40 OIR 100.29 69.89 OlN 111.46 128.28 OlC 76.06 67.48 02R 126.83 86.33 02N 94.40 110.64 02c 78.66 71.18 Time Period -IO%1 -15%--20% I\" ' \"\"I I \"\"\"\"'1\"\"\"\"'I \" ' \" ' \"I I \" \" ' \"I':\" 1926 1936 1946 1956 1966 1976 YEAR -ACT -OIR -OIN -...-.-OIC OPM = Option Pricing Model 1926 1936 1946 1956 1966 1976 YEAR -ACT -02R -02N -------. 02c OPM n Option Pricing Model Figure IO Actual and Predicted Underwriting Profit Margin Summary Statistics, 1926-1985 i E -8% 4% 0% .4% ATTTTTTTCCDOOOOOO CARRRRRRAACll 1 2 2 2 TRRRRRRRPPFRNCRNC G12345612 MODEL ii@@!
