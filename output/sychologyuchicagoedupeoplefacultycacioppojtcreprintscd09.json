    "abstract": "That the human brain is the organ of the mind is not in dispute, but we know remarkably little about the brain mechanisms underlying the mind. What are the functional structures and computational processes of the human brain that subserve cognition, emotion, and behavior? Given the complexity of the human brain, progress in understanding the functional organization and structure of the human brain depends on sophisticated theoretical specifications of the psychological representations and processes that differentiate two or more comparison conditions. Psychological scientists, therefore, are well positioned to lead the search for brain mechanisms underlying psychological processes. Doing so constitutes an expansion of the purview of psychological science beyond a science of behavior, and beyond a science of the mind, to include a science of the brain. Such an expansion of the mission of psychological science has implications for the infrastructure and training needs of the discipline.\nWilliam James began his Principles of Psychology with the statement, ''Psychology is the Science of Mental Life, both of its phenomena and of their conditions'' (1890, p. 1). James went on to argue in his opening pages that the organ of the mind was the brain and that: Bodily experiences, therefore, and more particularly brain-experiences, must take a place amongst those conditions of the mentalife of which Psychology need take account. . . . Our first conclusion, then, is that a certain amount of brain physiology must be presupposed or included in Psychology. (James, 1890, pp. 4-5)    Charles\nDarwin (1859\nDarwin ( /1909, p. 257, p. 257) also regarded the brain as a product of evolution and the science of psychology as concerned with these foundations. Perhaps the time has come for psychologists to fully realize their vision for our science and to take the lead in identifying the brain and molecular mechanisms upon which psychological operations are based.",
    "full_text": "Although the brain has long been recognized as the organ of human mental life, the methods for investigating the brain mechanisms upon which psychological processes are based were crude and limited a century ago. John B. Watson (1913) rejected the scientific study of internal processes as the proper domain of psychology, arguing instead that psychology should be limited to the scientific study of observable behavior. Behaviorism dominated much of psychological science for much of the 20th century, and it was not until the latter part of the century that psychological science as a whole began to address mental as well as behavioral phenomena using scientifically rigorous methods and procedures. Even then, however, neuroscience played a relatively minor role in psychology beyond the field of biopsychology (e.g., Gazzaniga, 1995;Kosslyn & Koenig, 1995; see also, Allport, 1947;Woodrow, 1942).\n\nResearchers have typically thought it best to address the question of the brain mechanisms upon which psychological operations are based at as small a scale as possible, so psychological theories were often ignored by neuroscientists until near the end of the 20th century (e.g., see Posner & Raichle, 1994). As Llina ´s (1989) noted, '' . . . the brain, as complex as it is, can only be understood from a cellular perspective. This perspective has been the cornerstone of neurosciences over the past 100 years' ' (p. vii).\n\nA great deal has been learned about the brain mechanisms underlying psychological processes from advances in our understanding of the basic building blocks of biological systems, Address correspondence to John T. Cacioppo, Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, University of Chicago, 5848 S. University Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637; e-mail: Cacioppo@uchicago.edu.\n\nand the cellular and molecular details of the brain have much yet to contribute. However, the mental activities surrounding consciousness, perception, and thought are the result of columns of neurons stacked next to each other, forming elemental circuits that function as a unit, with multiple assemblies of such units within the brain working together as a network of distributed, sometimes recursively connected, interacting brain regions with the different areas making specific and often task-modulated contributions (e.g., see Poeppel & Monahan, 2008;Posner & Raichle, 1994). Deciphering the secrets of brain function, therefore, will require the study of large assemblies and networks of cells as well as genetic, molecular, and cellular processes, with an emphasis on multilevel integrative analyses (e.g., Cacioppo, Berntson, Sheridan, & McClintock, 2000).\n\nFor instance, Hamer (2002) outlined two views of the genetic bases of behavior. In the first, depicted in Panel A of Figure 1, genes are directly responsible for specific behaviors. There is reasonable evidence for such linkages in simple organisms, and when such linkages exist, a focus on individual genes leads in a straightforward fashion to the associated behavioral expression.\n\nThe evidence for such simple linkages between individual genes and human behavior is far less compelling, however (e.g., Crabbe, Wahlsten, & Dudek, 1999;Hamer, 2002). This realization led to the second view, in which networks of genes and multiple environmental factors (including social environmental factors; see Cole et al., 2007;Ruan & Wu, 2008) impact neuroendocrine and brain development and function, which in turn influences psychological and behavioral processes (see Fig. 1, Panel B). Behavioral processes, in turn, can influence genetic expression, brain development and function, and behavior (e.g., Champagne et al., 2008;Meaney, 2001). In an illustrative study, Champagne et al. (2008) demonstrated in rats that maternal licking and grooming in infancy influenced dendritic branch length and spine density in the hippocampus and modulated long-term potentiation under basal and stresslike conditions.\n\nIt is now widely recognized that cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes often unfold unconsciously and that this unconscious processing is adaptive and frees up limited processing resources, ''with the end products reaching awareness, and even then only sometimes'' (LeDoux, 2000, p. 156; see also Wilson, 2002). Psychological scientists therefore have developed rigorous theoretical models that specify structures and processes of the mind, and they have developed behavioral paradigms that permit the isolation of posited structures and processes for dissection and analysis. These theoretical specifications and paradigms are important for understanding the biological basis of mental and behavioral processes because the brain and genes are too complex to identify their functions without theory to guide the process of empirical exploration and discovery. Accordingly, the identification of which genes, gene transcripts, proteins, cells, cell assemblies, brain regions, and neural networks are relevant to a given psychological process is advanced by the empirical isolation of this psychological process. The classic work on the neural substrates of classical conditioning, which proved so productive because behavioral paradigms for isolating this specific form of learning were so well specified, is a case in point (e.g., Christian & Thompson, 2003;Kandel, 2006;LeDoux, 2007).\n\nFor most of the 20th century, investigations of the brain mechanisms underlying psychological processes in humans were limited to postmortem examinations, observations of the occasional unfortunate individual who suffered trauma to or disorders of the brain, electroencephalography and event-related brain potential recording in response to specific cognitive or behavioral tasks, and in animals it was similarly limited to methods such as brain lesions, electrophysiological recording, and neurochemistry (Berntson & Cacioppo, in press;Raichle, 2000;Sarter, Berntson, & Cacioppo, 1996). Developments in multimodal structural, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological brain imaging acquisition and analysis techniques; more sophisticated specifications and analyses of focal brain lesions; focused experimental manipulations of brain activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation and pharmacological agents; and emerging visualization and quantitative techniques that integrate anatomical and functional connectivity-in addition to information about neural processes at different scales of organization-are creating new opportunities for scientific investigations of the working human brain. Despite the increased sophistication and data yield from recent advances that make it possible to observe the operation of the working brain at various levels of analysis, however, an atheoretical exploration alone is not likely to yield many discoveries of the working mind. It is simply too complex to understand the neural basis of specific mental processes without well-designed tasks that isolate those processes:\n\n. . . the task of functional brain imaging becomes clear: identify regions and their temporal relationships associated with the performance of a well-designed task. The brain instantiation of the task will emerge from an understanding of the elementary operations performed within such a network. (Raichle, 2000, p. 34) To summarize thus far, the identification of the brain mechanisms underlying specific psychological processes requires the accurate specification of psychological processes. Psychological scientists are the experts in this specification and in creating protocols for isolating specific psychological processes in the normal waking brain, so psychological scientists have a central role to play in this endeavor. Of course, contemporary theories regarding psychological representations and processes are approximations that continue to evolve as new empirical data, methods, and models are developed, and major questions remain about these representations and processes. The pursuit of the answer to this question brings with it new methods, data, analyses, and models. As such, the pursuit of such questions will contribute not only to a better understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying these processes, but also to the evolution of sophisticated psychological theories. Who can better lead these efforts than scientists centered on the psychological level of analysis? Accordingly, psychological science in the 21st century can and should become not only the science of overt behavior, not only the science of the mind, but the science of brain function.\n\nThis proposal flies in the face of two diametrical positions in the discipline. The first is the view that psychology deals in dualistic reasoning:\n\nHistorically, the question of the relation of the body to the mind was, at best, opaque; the mental attributes of humans were only vaguely related to the attributes of the brain. Despite the increase in our knowledge of brain morphology and function at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, there was still a feeling among many scholars that the nature of human reason might be related to some new and wonderful knowledge totally alien to that which is accessible through the scientific method. (Llina ´s, 1989, p. vii) The scientific study of the brain mechanisms underlying psychological processes is premised on the rejection of Rene Descartes' contention that the body and mind were made of complete different stuff because the body existed in time and space and the mind had no spatial dimension (Miller, 2005). Instead, psychological scientists have developed theoretical constructs and models to provide a means of understanding highly complex activity without needing to specify each individual action's simplest components, thereby providing an efficient means of describing the behavior of a complex system. Chemists who work with the periodic table on a daily basis use recipes rather than the periodic table to cook not because food preparation cannot be reduced to chemical expressions, but because it is not cognitively efficient to do so. The scientist who uses psychological constructs is no more a dualist than a chemist who uses both culinary and chemical levels of analysis to understand what it takes to develop fine cuisine.\n\nThe second diametrical position is the view that psychology concerns mental life and that any reductionistic account of mental or behavioral phenomena falls outside the realm of psychology (e.g., Coltheart, 2006;Kihlstrom, 2006). What is being proposed is an expansion of the scope of psychological science, not a substitution. Expanding the purview of psychology does not mean that studying the mind or behavior is not essential or worthwhile. To the contrary, the need remains for those who are focused exclusively on psychological and behavioral questions. Moreover, as neuroscientific approaches are applied to more complex questions, what were thought to be basic principles are being revisited as, for instance, behavioral phenomena that initially seemed unrelated are found to possibly share a common underlying mechanism (e.g., see Poldrack & Wagner, 2008). Such advances are especially exciting when they suggest a new conceptualization that explains not only the observed behavior, but a host of others as well. Such developments require test and refinement in behavioral studies. The question posed here, therefore, constitutes an extension to include study of the underlying brain (and other biological) mechanisms, not a retreat from existing lines of inquiry.\n\nIn sum, science is a collective as well as a cumulative activity. The expansion of the sphere of psychological science does not imply all psychological scientists need to or should change what they are doing. There is a need for individual psychological scientists who work exclusively at various individual levels of analysis asking very specific and limited questions. In fact, the theoretical specification of psychological processes and the development of paradigms to dissect these processes to test overarching theories are accorded more importance by broadening the province of psychological science. The discipline of psychology can become a brain science as well as a cognitive and behavioral science if some individuals within the discipline devote their scientific attention to the question posed here and if each level communicates with the other, including those within the academic environment.\n\nQUESTION?\n\nThose entering psychology to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying psychological processes may require background and graduate training that differ in some respects from what is currently found in most departments. A strong grounding in psychological research, theory, methods, experimental design, and statistics may remain central elements of graduate training, but a stronger grounding in mathematics, computational modeling, biology, and the neurosciences may also be vital for studying these mechanisms.\n\nIn addition to the training needs, the infrastructure needs should be considered. Funding agencies, universities, and departments have felt the increased hardware, software, and staffing costs associated with brain imaging and related technologies. Although technical and methodological advances have made important contributions to our ability to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying psychological operations, psychological science would benefit from new computational and neuroinformational tools as well. One of the most powerful pattern recognition computational devices that exist today is the human expert. New visualization tools capitalize on this strength by permitting collaborating scientists from different disciplines with unique but related expertise to literally see connections and organizations in the data that heretofore have been difficult if not impossible to envision. What is needed is a human brain visualization, computation, and analysis suite of tools to promote interdisciplinary insights and understandings in brain science.\n\nImagine a neuroanatomist, a neurobiologist, and a psychological scientist standing in a virtual reality (VR) environment looking at an anatomically accurate, translucent three-dimensional (3D) image of the human brain. Each might have the ability to manipulate the 3D brain to display it in any orientation in space; parse it into slices or pieces (e.g., reversibly cutting away lateral surfaces) to permit examination of interior gross anatomical structures and rotate slices through other perspectives (e.g., twisting an axial into a coronal position to trace the anatomical structures in a new 3D space; see Figure 2); identify by unique color coding the anatomical connections to any nucleus or between any two nuclei within the brain; visualize the structures and connections characterized by specific types of cells, neurotransmitters, or receptors (e.g., dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic pathways); and project various mappings onto the 3D image (e.g., flat maps, Brodmann's areas; see Figure 3).\n\nFurther, multilevel integrative analyses of brain function would be advanced if scientists were are able to zoom in from gross anatomical visualizations to more detailed anatomical representations of specific regions or nuclei (see spinal cord inset in Figure 2) to better examine the incoming and outgoing connections to a cluster of cells, the subnuclei within any nucleus, or the neural connection and networks within and across regions or subnuclei. As before, the collaborating scientists ideally would be able to manipulate the 3D neuroanatomical structures to depict it in any spatial orientation; subdivide it into component structures; identify and color code the anatomical connections to any subnucleus, between any two subnuclei, or between a subnucleus and any other region of the brain; visualize the structures and connections characterized by specific types of cells, neurotransmitters, or receptors (e.g., dopaminergic pathways); project various mappings onto the 3D image; and inspect the temporal dynamics of the flow of information processing. Much more is known about the cell types and connections in the brains of rats and monkeys than in the brains of humans, however, so the necessary neuroanatomical data on the human brain also is a needed component of this infrastructure.\n\nAt any scale of representation of the 3D display of the human brain (e.g., gross neuroanatomy), the computational power and relevant databases are needed to map findings from the extant literature onto the brain, and meta-analytic statistical modules are needed to permit statistical summaries of this literature to be calculated and displayed in near real time (see Figure 4). Scientists would further benefit from the ability to plug in data from one or more empirical studies. For instance, the lesions of circumscribed areas of the brain have been related to very specific cognitive or behavioral functions. Human lesions seldom respect precise neuroanatomical boundaries, which can make it difficult to identify the precise anatomical locus associated with a cognitive or behavioral deficit. One could conceive of extending the envisioned system to overlay structural images of the lesions from a group of patients to determine common and unique areas and to coregister cognitive or behavioral data as a function of these anatomical mappings. For instance, clicking on a particular nucleus involved in the lesions in the patient sample might produce a two-dimensional (2D) regression plot, complete with coefficients and statistics, with the extent of damage of the nucleus depicted along the abscissa and the behavioral results on the ordinate. By including lesion-control patients (who are ''controls'' because they have no damage to the target nucleus), it would be possible to examine the extent to which the behavioral deficit is specific to the lesions in the experimental group. By combining the features described above, the team of scientists is able to identify the upstream and downstream anatomical connections to the nucleus, and they can examine the patients' performance in near real time on cognitive and behavioral tests designed to probe their functional effects as well. By visually examining how the lesions relate to various anatomical organizations (e.g., as a nucleus, as a roadway between nuclei, as a central component of the noradrenergic system), specific and integrative hypotheses could be tested.\n\nThe anatomical overlay of lesion data from the experimental and lesion-control groups also would make it possible to similarly examine the cognitive or behavioral effects of other regions that were lesioned in some, but not all, of the experimental group. Lesions of the amygdala, for instance, are often unilateral and may spare the bed nucleus stria terminalis (the ''extended'' amygdala), a region that animal studies suggest is involved in context-fear conditioning (i.e., anxiety) rather than cue-fear conditioning, which instead involves the central amygdala.\n\nBut the real power of this needed visualization/analysis toolkit would be its coregistration and multimodal features. As illustrated in Figure 5, scientists now can probe the structures and processes of the human brain at scales and time frames that were unimaginable a half century ago. Despite the fact that these various measurement modalities are now available, it is not yet possible to integrate these measurement modalities into a common visualization and analysis frame for use by interdisciplinary scientific teams to test, refine, and integrate theories of human brain function. For instance, it is conceivable that researchers could access the results from prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, depict these results on the 3D representation, and examine comparisons within and across theoretical conditions statistically using meta-analytic procedures. In addition, the fMRI data from a specific study might be analyzed and depicted on the 3D brain in near real time, and these data might be coregistered with and statistically related to the results from other measurement modalities, including those that differ in organizational and temporal scale (e.g., eye tracking, behavioral, event-related brain po- tentials from EEG, microelectrodes). Such visualization, computation, and analysis tools would enable a level of integrative theorizing and hypothesis testing that has not been possible to date.\n\nFor instance, the visual properties of scenes drive neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and visual perception has been found to involve a dorsal stream, or ''where'' pathway, and a ventral stream, or ''what'' pathway. The dorsal (''where'') stream includes the areas designated V1, V2, V5/MT, and the inferior parietal lobule and is associated with motion, representation of object locations, and control of the eyes and arms when visual information is used to guide saccades or reaching. The ventral (''what'') stream includes the areas V1, V2, V4, and the inferior temporal lobe (areas that include the lateral occipital complex and the fusiform gyrus) and is associated with form recognition, object representation, face rec-ognition, and long-term memory. Consider what could have been discovered much earlier if the data for an fMRI study contrasting ''what'' and ''where'' visual processing tasks were available within such a visualization and analysis environment. A team of scientists might ask for a whole-brain voxel-based analysis contrasting the ''what'' and fixed-crosshair viewing (baseline) conditions and begin to see evidence of a ventral stream of visual information processing unfold. Specifying V1 and asking for a functional connectivity analysis would further elucidate this ventral stream, and the additional instruction to overlay the anatomical connectivity might add additional details to this stream. If the available published literature using similar experimental conditions could be overlaid, the investigators could quickly determine how the results of the study relate to the extant literature. If the available published literature on visual deficits in lesion patients or behavioral data following the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation could be overlaid, investigators could examine the causal importance of various regions along the ventral pathway. One might also examine computational models of what the transformations per-formed at each nucleus along the ventral pathway by running near real-time simulations to compare results with neural and behavioral data. A comparable series of operations might then be performed by contrasting the ''where'' and baseline Counting Stroop (Bush et al.,Ref. 3) cc cc Cognitive task Emotional task Affective division Cognitive division Affective division Cognitive division cc cc 70 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 b a 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 Counting Stroop (Bush et al.,Ref. 17) Emotional Counting Stroop (Whalen et al.,Ref. 18) Fig. 4.

CC represents the corpus callosum (from Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000). conditions, providing clear, integrative, and quantitative evidence for the existence of separable and interacting pathways of visual information processing. The ventral and dorsal visual processing streams were used for illustrative purposes because sufficient information is known about these pathways that it is easy to envision what such a visualization, computation, and analysis toolkit might provide. There is an argument about whether ventral and dorsal auditory processing streams exist and, if so, what the anatomical, computational, and functional details of these pathways might be. This and other areas of inquiry would be advanced were this infrastructure available today.\n\nFinally, the discussion thus far has centered around a team of scientists working together within a virtual reality (VR) environment. Although this might be an important presentation mode because of its immersive, interdisciplinary, interactive nature, such an environment also constitutes a constraint that technology can overcome. High-density 2D renderings on large displays can provide the same computation, analysis, and interactivity and a close approximation to the 3D visualizations possible in a VR environment. Such 2D platforms, when combined with collaborative tools for real-time virtual meetings, would eliminate obstacles of geography and VR environment availability, making the neuroinformational toolkit a much more accessible and usable toolbox for advancing the science of complex behavior and the brain.\n\nThe identification of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying specific psychological processes requires the accurate specification of psychological processes (like in genetics, one first needs to identify a phenotype). Psychological scientists are the experts in this specification and in creating protocols for isolating specific psychological processes in the normal waking brain, so psychological scientists have a central role to play in this endeavor. Investigations of brain function also will likely contribute to the evolution of sophisticated psychological theories, and scientists centered on the psychological level of analysis again have a central role to play. Accordingly, psychological science in the 21st century can and should become not only the science of overt behavior, and not only the science of the mind, but also the science of brain function.\n\nVolume 4-Number 1 Copyright r 2009 Association for Psychological Science\n\nVolume 4-Number 1\n\nJohn T.
