    "abstract": "Process oriented observations in straits have been concerned with the overall structure of the flow and the factors that control the exchange or modify water properties of the exchanging layers. These include the existence and location of exchange controls, the formation and behavior of distinct layers, time dependent effects associated with tidal and meteorological forcing, boundary layer separation in both a lateral and a vertical sense, entrainment and mixing between layers and the radiation of internal bores or solitary waves.",
    "full_text": "Observations of the circulation in straits have a long history with notable contributions stimulated by the challenge of explaining flow in the Straits of Bosphorus and Gibraltar (Deacon 1985). Early observations made use of drogue studies, which revealed the bi-directional character of the exchange in these straits, but the advent of modern instrumentation has stimulated rapid advances in our understanding. These developments in turn are stimulating parallel theoretical and modeling efforts.\n\nThe focus of field measurements has evolved from observations designed to acquire a basic description of the oceanography, towards systematic attempts to test hypotheses, such as the presence or absence of maximal exchange conditions, or the mechanisms by which internal bores are generated. In addition to the overall measurement of exchange rates, field studies have started to address the smaller scale processes that have usually been neglected in models. Detailed measurements of shear flow instability and its contribution to mixing, of boundary layer separation effects, 3-dimensional circulation and the radiation of internal bores are now identified as significant components of many strait flows, posing new challenges for theoretical analysis and explanation. This brief discussion summarizes some of the measurement techniques and the recent observations. The focus is on straits that are not wide relative to the deformation radius. A primary interest is in the factors that influence control over the exchange.\n\nMeasurement technology has evolved rapidly and is transforming the way in which we can observe both small scale and time dependent phenomena, presenting new challenges and opportunities for modeling and analysis.\n\nThe observational challenges come from the range of scales involved. If the circulation is time varying, it is obviously desirable to acquire measurements throughout the area of interest over a period short relative to the time scale of the forcing, especially in straits subject to meteorological rather than predictable tidal forcing.\n\nMany of the most significant contributions to our understanding have come from measurements using a combination of different in situ and remote sensing techniques from ships. Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ACDP) have played a key role here, as the structure of the current field is fundamental to identifying exchange flows. By combining repeated CTD profiles with the Doppler data it is possible to estimate Froude numbers directly as a function of position and time. Such measurements are fundamental to the determination of flow control, as well as to the calculation of layer transports, shear stability and other characteristics.\n\nIn situ measurement of shear microstructure has been used to infer dissipation, providing additional insight on the time and location of turbulent energy losses. For example Wesson & Gregg (1994) acquired direct measurements of dissipation both in the vicinity of the sill and within the internal bore in the Strait of Gibraltar. The measured values appear fully consistent with expectations based on the Farmer energy loss calculated from internal hydraulic considerations (Farmer & Armi, 1988).\n\nA novel measurement approach that has proven effective in tracking transports in the vicinity of sills is the Lagrangian float (D'Asaro et al. 1996), a technique that has also been used to explore the transition between turbulence and buoyancy dominated flow (D'Asaro & Lien, 2000).\n\nAcoustic imaging of the back-scatter field has proven particularly helpful to the identification of small scale structure. Quite often a shear or density interface will be associated with enhanced acoustic target strength, allowing acoustic imaging to map the interface structure, even when a ship is traveling rapidly. The combination of ADCP mapping of the velocity field with high resolution imaging (Fig. 1) provides a powerful technique for resolving the flow over large areas in a relatively short time. Continuous CTD profiling is not possible except at low speed, but the acoustic methods provide an effective means of interpolating the density structure between more widely spaced CTD stations.\n\nInternal hydraulic controls are often associated with rapidly varying interface depths, shear instability and jumps. Acoustic imaging may provide the only technique for highly resolved measurement of these processes, since it may be impractical to profile with sufficient density using in situ sensors. Accurate positioning of the vessel is essential for generating accurate data maps. This task has been transformed by the availability of GPS. Although recording in situ current meters are a well established tools for acquiring longer time series than is possible from a ship, the moored ADCP has proven useful because of its high vertical resolution (Fig. 2),especially when combined with a dense vertical array of recording temperature/salinity sensors. The passage of internal bores is easily recognized with almost any recording sensor, but the depth change or amplitude measurement typically requires a higher resolution than is usually practical with in situ current meters. Highly resolved back scatter imaging is also useful for identifying density interfaces and even the ADCP back scatter intensity output which tends to have lower resolution than a dedicated imaging sonar, has proven helpful in monitoring the internal response to changing tide and meteorological conditions.\n\nWell resolved pressure measurements also have an important role to play. Modern quartz pressure sensors can resolve pressure fluctuations which may be interpreted in terms of energy losses, associated, for example, with tidal effects. Extensive studies of sub-tidal fluctuations in sea surface slope using tide gauges at either end of a strait suggest the potential of this approach, especially for monitoring seasonal and longer term effects (i.e. Freeland & Farmer, 1980).\n\nIntegral methods of measurement that average over large volumes or over the total transport through a strait have obvious potential for monitoring flows in Straits. Motionally induced electric fields (the Geomagnetic ElectroKinetograph or GEK method and its derivatives) can be measured and interpreted in terms of transport, once the subtle aspects of calibration have been resolved, a technique that is being actively explored at a number of sites.\n\nTime-of-flight acoustic propagation provides another approach for integral measurement. The difficulty in this case is that the integration is along a path that will depend on the variable sound speed structure of the channel. Nethertheless, this approach does seem to offer interesting possibilities and has been demonstrated in the Strait of Gibraltar (Fig. 3). Yet another integral method is space-time acoustic scintillation, which relies on measurement of the translation of fine scale structure in the forward scattered acoustical field as it is advected by the current. This technique has been demonstrated in several coastal channels including the Bosphorus (Di Iorio & Yuce, 1999). The distinction between the time of flight measurement and the space-time scintillation analysis is that the former resolves the current along the path whereas the latter resolves the flow perpendicular to the path. The fine scale acoustical structure is related to the fine scale oceanographic features and inversion techniques allow derivation of integral properties of the scattering medium. For example Di Iorio and Farmer (1998) were able to separate temperature and velocity fluctuations and calculate the path averaged turbulence dissipation.\n\nRemote sensing adds the power of large scale imaging. A particularly striking contribution of both visual and radar imaging of straits has been the identification of internal wave radiation. Radar systems (Watson & Robinson, 1989) or cameras mounted on mountains (Pawlowicz, 2002) overlooking a strait also have potential here.\n\nFinally, both radar measurement (especially synthetic aperture) and aerial photography can be used to detect smaller scale surface structure which contains many clues to the subsurface properties. Aircraft measurements in particular provide a flexibility in deployment timing and location that may not be available with measurements from space. In the case of observation from a light aircraft or helicopter, the aircraft can fly along particular features, such as a front or internal wave, using GPS to provide a precise spatial measurement.\n\nThe concept of hydraulic control is of particular importance in straits, as it exercises direct influence on the exchange. Maximal exchange is a special case in which two controls act to determine the maximum rate at which a two-layer flow can exchange. In its simplest form, a control occurs when the sum of the layer Froude numbers is unity (see, for example, Armi, 1986):\n\nwhere the subscript defines the layer 1,2 and\n\nwhere U is the layer speed, g' is the reduced gravity and h is the layer depth. This definition is suitable for discrete layers, which are often characteristic of flow in straits. However, a layer may be density stratified and sheared, in which case an equivalent definition may be stated in terms of the relative propagation speed of long internal waves. A control occurs where a long internal wave is arrested. As discussed by Pratt (1986) and others, friction acts to drive the flow towards criticality. In longer straits for which friction is expected to be important (c.f. Pratt's 1986 criterion), there are good reasons to look for the implications of frictional effects.\n\nIn straits for which the internal Froude number approaches unity, rapid adjustments in velocity and density structure can occur over short distances. This is particularly true in straits such as Gibraltar where one of the controls occurs over a steep sided sill.\n\nMost recent observations in straits have addressed the presence of layered structure and internal controls. Murray & Johns (1997) used moored ADCP measurements to find a seasonally varying two-and three-layered structure in Bab el Mandeb (see Fig. 2), raising interesting questions about the role of controls in limiting the heat flux. Gregg, Ozsoy & Latif (1999) and Gregg & Ozsoy (2002) and others searched for an internal control using ADCP measurements at the Southern end of the Bosphorus, to check whether or not a maximal exchange condition applied; the control at the northern end is readily identifiable. This measurement is particularly challenging in the southern Bosphorus, because the surface layer becomes extremely shallow at this location and the measurements are limited by instrument depth and other factors. Farmer & Armi (1988), Armi & Farmer (1988) found two controls in the Strait of Gibraltar in April 1986, supporting the concept of maximal exchange. Their measurements were also acquired with an ADCP, supported by XBT/XSSV profiles which could be acquired with the vessel traveling at speed. A single control acting on a lower layer as it passes over a sill is relatively common and has been measured, for example, using an ADCP in Knight Inlet by Farmer & Armi, 2000. Rapid traverses allow the structure of the control to be tracked as it changes under the varying tidal current, providing insights on the time dependent response. Figure 4 shows three such sections as the flow makes the transition between the controlled and uncontrolled state.\n\nThe advent of highly resolved density measurements acquired in conjunction with ADCP and acoustic imaging has revealed features of the internal response that can only be explained by mass transfer between different moving layers. For example, the repeated acoustic and CTD sections shown in Figure 4 illustrate a special case of the consequences of entrainment from the lower to the intermediate layer. Even though the tidal current was decreasing during these measurements, the Froude number was increasing, due to the reduced density difference at the interface, allowing the intermediate layer to be pushed downstream over the sill as control at the crest is effectively lost (Armi & Farmer, 2002).\n\nOn a larger scale, measurements in the Bosphorus make it clear that Black Sea water moving in the upper layer becomes progressively more saline as it travels south and a smaller but still measurable decrease in salinity occurs in the lower layer as it moves north. Gerdes, Garrett & Farmer (2002) showed that in all but one unidirectional case, where the upper layer flow is larger than the lower layer by a certain Froude number dependent margin, entrainment acts to force the flow towards criticality in the same way as friction. A general result describing the interface slope as a function of Froude number F 2 and entrainment speed u e is:\n\nwhere v is the upper and u is the lower layer speed, H is the elevation of the sea floor, W is the channel width and Cd is the drag coefficient. This result provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of an exchange flow in straits such as the Bosphorus where both friction and entrainment are of comparable importance and an interpretation in terms of discrete layers is justified. It also accounts for the overall shape of the interface, especially in the southern narrow section where both entrainment and friction play a significant role in determining the exchange process.\n\nAlthough there are numerous laboratory estimates of entrainment rates, the applicability of these to natural environments is at best uncertain. This motivates the use of acoustic imaging and other techniques to reveal the underlying mechanisms of entrainment. Acoustic images of sheared flow often reveal the presence of shear instabilities at the interface between the layers. These can be seen on a massive scale in sill flows and have been examined in a laboratory setting (Pawlak & Armi, 1998), revealing the way in which additional vorticity is provided by the sloping interface. Both laboratory and field observations show whisps of denser fluid rising from the cusps of the instability.\n\nAnalysis of the detailed mechanisms associated with entrainment inevitably demand highly resolved measurements of the velocity field within the instabilities.\n\nThese are hard to achieve by conventional means and push the limit of the stand ADCP. For example Fig. 5 shows instabilities above the lee face of the sill in Knight Inlet. ADCP measurements (not shown here) delineate the overall structure of the flow in these features, but push the limits of robust Doppler interpretation. The JANUS configuration Doppler current profiler is limited in resolution by the spreading beams, which must be combined to generate a current vector. The combination of data from the different beams is based on assumption that the flow is similar in all three beams. In certain cases, entrainment can be measured in a rather direct way by mapping the transport between discrete layers, where the layers are identified for example by density steps or well defined scattering layers. The rate at which these layers are transported through a sheared interface then defines the entrainment rate (Farmer & Armi, 1999).\n\nUltimately the success of predictive modeling will depend on our ability to parameterize the sub-grid scale processes. Laboratory models provide insight, but are generally limited by their ability to represent high Reynolds number flow.\n\nThis provides motivation for using observations in real environments to explore the small scale structure, thus motivating models of these process that will lead to reliable parameterizations for incorporation in strait models.\n\nTemporal variability in straits presents one of the greatest challenges to accurate description. Most ocean straits are subject to tidal forcing. An important practical consideration is whether or not the flow can be considered quasi-steady. For example, in the case of maximal exchange flows, the relavant time scale for internal adjustment is the time taken for a long wave to propagate from one control to the other. In the Strait of Gibraltar this condition is met approximately. For longer period seasonal or atmospheric forcing, quasi-steady assumptions are almost certainly justified.\n\nA striking consequence of the inherent nonlinearity in controlled flows is the transformation of tidal into higher frequency energy. The most prominent expression of this is the formation of internal bores. Fig. 6 shows a synthetic aperture radar image of an undular bore radiating from the Strait of Gibraltar into the Alboran Sea and is typical of many similar radar and is similar to many other optical and radar images. The waves tend to be rank ordered, spread radially from the source and are accompanied by a net deepening of the shallow surface stratification, consistent with the properties of an internal undular bore.\n\nThe generation mechanisms associated with radiating wave patterns have been the subject of fairly active research in recent years. Several studies have pointed to the relaxation of an internal hydraulic jump during the slackening tidal current as a source of the waves. This appears to be the case, for example in the Strait of Gibraltar and has been observed in great detail in a particular example for flow over the sill in Knight Inlet when the stratification was weak (Farmer & Smith 1980). In the latter case the downstream jump in the lee of the sill was undular -the signature might also be interpreted as constituting a set of finite amplitude lee waves -and successive wave troughs passed back over the sill as the tidal current slackened to form a sequence of waves propagating upstream with the character of an internal undular bore.\n\nThis mechanism completely fails to explain all cases, however. Recent studies by Cummins et al. (2002) seek to explain observations of waves generated upstream of a sill when the flow is controlled. These waves do not pass over the sill crest, but represent the evolution of upstream influence.\n\nThe observations show that tidal interaction with the sill produces a deformation of the interface propagating upstream; the interface has positive slope in the direction of propagation and therefore steepens due to nonlinearity, eventually forming a 'shock front' that radiates internal solitary waves.\n\nFigure 6 Internal undular bores radiating from the Strait of Gibraltar into the Alboran Sea, One set of waves is leaving the figure to the right, while a second set is forming within the strait. (Alpers et al., 1996) Propagation of the internal bore in the Strait of Gibraltar produces a strong signal on the acoustic propagation measurements discussed above. Figure 7 shows a superposition of travel time measurements from several tidal cycles, illustrating both the overall tidal modulation of the signal and the sharp jump when the bore passes through. Full advantage of these novel measurements requires a combined application of acoustic propagation theory and a model for the bore behavior.  In straits that are subject to only weak tidal influence, meteorological effects may dominate the time dependent response.\n\nGerdes (personal communication) observed an Orkuz event in the Bosphorus, in which the barotropic pressure gradient resulting from a passing storm, completely arrested the lower layer, transporting the brackish surface waters back towards the Black Sea (Fig 8). Observation of such infrequent phenomena depends on the availability of time series measurements from moored instruments, in this case an ADCP mounted on the sea floor.\n\nStraits often exhibit abrupt changes in topography in the form of coastal headlands along the shores, or sills and other subsurface features. As the flow encounters such topographic features an adverse pressure gradient may arise, sufficient to cause the flow to separate. This occurs in a striking way in the Bosphorus, for example, where there is complete separation of the flow around one particularly sharp bend.\n\nSeparation can also occur over sills and has stimulated lively discussion in the literature. This topic is important, because separation can effectively inhibit transition of stratified flow over topography to the high drag state. Failure to properly include separation in model calculations has led to a misinterpretation of results. Boundary layer effects are not generally included in strait models, but may have to be considered for a comprehensive description where abrupt topography is present.\n\nFig. 9 shows an example of flow forming a separated jet downstream of the Knight Inlet sill. Later in the tidal cycle, as the intermediate layer fills in, separation is suppressed and the jet descends, reverting to the fully established state.  It has been common to interpret exchange flow problems in terms of two-dimensional representation. This may be justified in many cases, but care is required, especially in the presence of rapidly varying topography. Particularly interesting situations arise when flow separates from a headland, leading to a vertical shear zone dividing separate water masses with distinct and different density structure. An example of this process in Haro Strait is shown in Figures 10a,b. Figure 10a illustrates the separation zone immediately after it has left the headland. The shear zone is essentially vertical. Figure 10b shows the same front approximately 20 minutes later. This time delay is too short for rotational effects to play a significant role and the tilting of the interface appears to result from a horizontal density difference across the shear zone, leading to tilting. This tilting also stretches the vortex lines associated with the shear leading to intense turbulence and mixing (Farmer et al. 2002).\n\nThe discussion thus far has focused on stratified flow and it is true that most oceanographic flows in straits are indeed stratified and the stratification plays an important role in the circulation. Nevertheless, it is worth commenting that in coastal regions subject to strong tides, straits may exist in which the current is strong enough to drive the flow through a control with respect to the surface mode. In this case, even Farmer though the water may be stratified, the buoyancy effects are negligible relative to the inertial effects. One of many such examples on Canada's west coast is Nakwatka Rapids, a short strait connecting a large inland complex of fjords with the Pacific Ocean. Currents exceed 12knots and the surface visibly descends over 2.5m over the course of a few hundred meters (Fig. 11). All stratification is destroyed as the water passes through the channel and the transition from controlled to supercritical flow, back to subcritical flow via a surface hydraulic jump, which has been examined for the internal controls discussed above, now becomes visible to the naked eye, providing a striking example of hydraulic response in a strait where the surface Froude number exceeds unity.\n\nThis necessarily cursory survey of observations in straits makes no attempt to be comprehensive, but is intended to provide a representative sample of the techniques now being used and the phenomena being studied. Straits will continue to be important for many reasons and the oceanography of straits has rightly attracted attention. Apart from their significance to the surrounding oceanography and their sensitive location for monitoring climatic and other changes, straits also serve as excellent laboratories for the study of geophysical fluid dynamics."
