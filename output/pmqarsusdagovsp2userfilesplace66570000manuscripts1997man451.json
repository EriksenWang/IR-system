    "abstract": "Confined animal production generates enormous per-unit-area quantities of waste. Wastewater from dairy and swine operations has been successfully treated in constructed wetlands. Plants are an integral part of wetlands. Cattails and bul~~hes are commonly used in constructed wetlands for their capacity to transport oxygen to the sediment. Improved oxidation and nitrification may also be obtained by the use of the open water strips of marsh/pond/marsh designed wetlands. Wetlands nonnally have sufficient denitrifying microbial populations, carbon sources, and anaerobic conditions to promote denitrification processes. However, the anaerobic conditions of wetland sediments limit the rate of nitrification. Thus, denitrification of animal waste waters in wetlands is generally nitratelimited. Phosphorus (P) removal is also somewhat limited by the anaerobic conditions of wetlands. Therefore, when very high mass removal of nitrogen (N) and P is required, preor in-wetland procedures that promote oxidation are needed to increase treatment efficiency. An overland flow treatment removed 59% of ammonia-N applied in swine waste water at a 50-kg ha-1 d-1 rate, and 10010 was recovered as nitrate-No A media filter treatment transfonned up to 32% of the inflow total N into nitrate wh(~n waste water was recycled four times.

    "full_text": "treatment of waste water. Wetlands have been used successfully for municipal waste water treatment. New evidence shows that they have potential for the treatment of animal waste water.\n\nStrategies for successful wetland treatment of animal waste water are different from municipal waste water treatment. In municipal waste water treatment, the systems are operated to meet stream discharge requirements. Cu-rrently, direct discharge of animal waste water is not allowed. Constructed wetlands can transform and assimilate large quantities of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) from waste water. Hence, they can reduce the amount of nutrients that must be applied to the terminal land .treatment site.\n\nUltimately, the necessary treatments will depend upon the amount of land available for terminal management. Where land is limited, high percentages of the waste water nutrient loads need to be removed in the wetland. Here it is likely that pre-and post-wetland treatments will be necessary because C and P must be removed, and ammonia N (NH3-N) must be nitrified. If treatment steps and wetland -cells are properly sequenced, wetlands have the potential for high levels of nutrient mass removal.\n\nTwo types of wetlands (subsurface and free-water-surface-flow) are typically used (Hammer, 1989). Subsurface systems are subject to clogging and limited oxygen (02) diffusion. Free-water-surface-flow systems are more suitable for animal waste water treatment. Gumbricht (1993) categorized free-water-surface systems into free-floating-plant ponds, submersed-plant ponds, and constructed wetlands with emergent plants.\n\nPlantS\". Emergent plants are usually used as a component in constructed wetlands for waste water treatment. The roots and rhizomes of the plants play an important role in the nutrient removal process. They provide surfaces for bacterial growth, filtration of solids, nutrient uptake (Nichols, 1983), and O2 to anoxic soil environments to promote nitrificationdenitrification (Armstrong, 1964;Reddy et al., 1989). Wetland plants transport O2 from leaves and stems to roots (Armstrong, 1964), providing an oxidized microenvironment in the anaerobic root zone. The efficient use of wetlands for waste water treatment depends on the O2 transport capacity of the plant-root system and its diffiIsion across the free soil-water interface. Oxygen availability is also affected by the O2 demand of the wetland. Waste waters with extremely high biochemical oxygen demands (BOD) will generally exceed the capacity of the wetland to supply O2 and will consequently limit treatment. Such waste waters may require dilution, aerobic pre-treatment, or low loading rates. Organic Carbon. Carbon removal is an essential aspect ofN removal in wetlands because high C levels increase the BOD and promote the growth of heterotrophic organisms. Low O2 levels will decrease nitrification because it is carried out aerobically by autotrophic bacteria. The increased heterotrophs will outcompete the autotrophs for surface area on which nitrification could take place. Constructed wetlands will not completely remove C because plant litter and plant/root exudate continually add C to the system (Hunt et al., 1994). Yet, low levels of soluble C are not a problem because soluble C is necessary for anaerobic respiration and denitrification. Substantial amounts of C and nutrients can be removed from waste water by solid-liquid separation using dewatering presses and screens. Solids removal can also be enhanced by increased residence time in a settling basin. Both flocculation and precipitation can be increased by polyacrylamine (PAM) addition. Separated solids can be spread directly on the land or composted. Reduction of the C load that remains in the waste water can be accomplished in an anaerobic lagoon. If further C reduction is needed, the waste water can be treated in a facultative lagoon where wind aeration or pumped air can supply O2 for accelerated decomposition and nitrification. After the reduction of the C level, waste waters can be run through an alternating sand filter-media filtration system or across an overland flow treatment site to obtain nitrification.\n\nNitrogen. Organic N can be initially removed via filtration and sedimentation, but it will be mineralized and released over time as NH3-N. Amrnonia-N can take several possible pathways. Ammonia-N can be lost through volatilization under alkaline pH conditions, which often occurs in open water areas where algal growth can consume large amounts of carbon dioxide (COJ (Mikkelsen et al., 1978;Reddy and Graetz, 1981). It might even be possible to manage waste waters to promote NH3-N loss by volatilization. However, NH3-N can be absorbed by the surrounding ecosystems (i.e., surface waters, cropland, pasture land, and wooded zones), and continual emissions of large amounts ofNH3-N may cause undesirable shifts in these ecosystems. Amrnonia-N in the form of ammonium ~-N) i9n can be absorbed either by wetland plants or by anaerobic rnicroorganisms and converted back to biomass organic-N, or immobilized as an exchangeable ion in soil. Under anaerobic conditions, NH4-N would normally build up to excessive levels. However, both O2 diffusion from the atmosphere overlying floodwater and O2 transport by plants to the rooting zone can form an oxidized upper zone in the soil. The gradient between high concentrations ofNH4-N in the reduced soil and low concentrations iri the oxidized layer causes an upward diffusion ofNH4-N in the oxidized zone, where transformation to nitrate by bacteria (or nitrification) occurs (patrick and Reddy, 1976;Reddy and Graetz, 1988). Nitrificationreq~ires pH values above 5, aerobic conditions, and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria. Rapid nitrification can occur when the wetland is periodically dry from lack of waste water application or very high evapotranspiration. Under wetland conditions, nitrate diffuses from the aerobic soil layer to the anaerobic zone and undergoes microbial reduction to nitrous oxide (incomplete denitrification) and molecular N (complete nitrification) (Reddy et aI., 1980). Denitrification requires denitrifying microbes, anaerobic conditions, and C as an energy source. Gaseous losses ofN can be very large; they are generally the most significant N-removal mechanism for natural and constructed wetlands (Bowden, 198~/;Faulkner and Richardson, 1989).\n\nPhosphorus. Organic P may comprise a substantial reservoir in wetland soils because the litter -sediment processes control the long-term P removal capability of wetland ecosystems (Faulkner and Richardson, 1989). Inorganic P is retained by calcite, clay minerals, organometallic complexes, and iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides (Parfitt, 1978;Gale et al., 1994). Numerous investigators have found that oxa{ate-extractable iron is associated with P adsorption (Syers et al., 1973). This fraction comprises the poorly crystalline iron oxides that become highly soluble under prevalent-reduced conditions. This increased P solubility explains why wetlands treated with waste water can become rapidly P-saturated and export excessive quantities of P in a few years (Richardson, 1985).\n\nConstructed wetlands in Lagrange Co., Indiana, were used to treat waste water from a 70milk-cow herd (Reaves et al., 1994). Barnyard runoff, milkhouse waste water, and manure leachate passed through a settling pad prior to application to the wetland cells. The system consisted of three surface water wetland cells operated in parallel. Each cell was 6.1 x 61 m with a bottom slope of 1% with a clay liner. The predominant vegetation was cattails (Typha lalifolia), smartweed (Poiygonum spp.), and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). The wetland treatments reduced nutrient loads of nearby Lake Appleman (Table 1), but excessive solids loading limited their potential. A 10-cm-thick layer of solids accumulated in the initial third of each wetland cell during the first year of operation. These results emphasize the need for solids removal pre-treatment.\n\nThe constructed wetland at the Oregon State University dairy farm (Skarda et al., 1994) had six 4.6-x 29-m wetland cells operating in parallel with a 30-cm water depth. The dairy used a recycling flush system with solids removed, waste water was stored in a large tank prior to entering the wetlands, and the wetlands discharge was collected in a storage pond for pumping back to the storage tank. Maximum levels of NH3-N and total solids (TS) entering the wetlands were 100 mg L-1 and 1.5 g L-1, respectively. Maximum BOD load was 74 kg ha-1d-1.\n\nTable 1 Performance of four constructed wetlands systems for dairy waste water treatment ada ted from DuBo and Reaves, 1994;Coo er et al., 1992;Hunt et al., 1995b .\n\nIndiana Oregon Mississippi Kentucky -% reduction -~66 88 37 87 59 BODs TSS TKN NH3-N TP 79 72 64 64 74 61 73 57 54 66 75 64 90 61\n\nThe constructed wetland at the DeSoto Co., Mississippi dairy fann (Cooper et al., 1992) had three 6. 1-x 24. 4-m wetland cells operating in parallel that received waste water from a 41. Ix SI.8-m primary lagoon. Total waste entering the lagoon was 10.3 m3 day.1 and included barnyard runoff from a 3S2-m2 cattle holding lot, rainfall from building roofs, and rnilkhouse waste water. Data in Table 1 (Mississippi) shows average perfonnance of cells 1 and 3. Primary treatment and dilution resulted in a lower influent BOD, and a wetland-treated effluent BOD < 30 mg L -I.\n\nThe constructed wetland at the Mercer Co., Kentucky dairy farm (Hunt et al., 1995b) had two 9.1-x 24. 4-m cells in series that were planted with cattails. The waste water originated from lot runoff: milking facilities, and leachate from a covered manure stack pad. The liquids were collected in a settling basin for solids reduction and discharged by gravity to the wetland. Influent waste water characteristics (mg Lol) were: BOD= 452, total suspended solids (TSS)= 1132, TP= 72, TKN= 108, and NH3-N= 33. The settling basin removed about half of the volatile solids and total nitrogen but it did not reduce the BOD. Data in Table 1 shows performance of the first wetland during the first year. A rock-filled trench allowed discharge to flow over a fescue vegetative filter strip (18.3 m x 53.4 m) as a final nutrient removal component. This system has functioned well for nutrient mass removal.\n\nIn Mississippi, Cathcart et al. (1994) studied a marsh/pond/marsh constructed wetland system for the treatment of swine waste water. It contained two, parallel O.O4-ha constructed wetlands in series with two, O.O4-ha vegetative strips. Their wetland cells were 33 m long with less than a 1% slope. The shallow ends were planted with cattail (Typha latifolia, L.) and water chestnut (Trapa nutans, L.). The pond, a 15-m section in the middle of the wetland, was 23 cm deeper than the ends, and was unplanted. The combination of depth and turbidity has restricted emergent plant encroachment in the pond section. The waste water flowed from a facultative lagoon that primarily treated waste water from a farrowing house. Waste water had an NH3-N concentration of about 110 mg L -I. The post-wetland vegetative strips were 46 m long and contained grasses, weeds, and woody shrubs. The hydraulic loading rate was 1.3 cm day.l. The BOD, NH3-N, and total orthophosphate (o-PO4-P) were loaded at 6.1, 14.3, and 7.8 kg ha-1 day.l, respectively.\n\nThe oxidative influence of the pond section was demonstrated by data taken between April and July 1993. The mean and range for O2 concentrations of waste water at the influent, pond section, and effiuent were 3.4 (0.2-15.0), 9.1 (0.2-19.0), and 5.1 (0.5-15.3) mg L-1, respectively. This oxidative component was most likely a very important aspect of the high N removal capacity of these wetland cells. Hunt et al. (1995a) found that wetland cells used for treatment of swine were nitrate-limited for denitrific:ation. Thus, O2 to support nitrification is very important for the treatment capacity. The treatment efficiency of the wetlands and the grass filter strips for concentration and mass are presented in Table 2. The NH3-N and o-P04-P loading rates were very high. Yet, the wetlands gave 71% and 44% mass removal for NH3-, N and a-PO 4-P, respectively; and the combined mass treatment efficiency was> 95% for all parameters. If this level of removal can be sustained over a 250-day period, such a system would remove 3.5 Mg N ha-1 yr -I. This removal rate is about 10 times greater than that expected for forage grasses.\n\n.\n\n(reproduced by permission from Cathcart et al., 1994). The permeability of their soils produced a combination of overland and lateral subsurface flow. Their work showed the substantial nutrient assimilative capacities of the grass filter strips and wooded riparian zones. Overland flow has lon,g been known to be an effective method of treating cannery waste water and municipal waste waters, and its processes are somewhat similar to those of wetlands (Hunt and Lee, 1976). Thus, overl~d flow strips may be very good pre-or post-wetland components of functional and sustainable treatment systems. . In Alabama, McCaskeyet al. (1994) were concerned with the BOD-based loading rate of 67 kg of BOD ha-1 day.1 because this guideline was developed for municipal waste water, which has a relatively low BOD:NH3-N ratio. They hypothesized that swine waste water loading rates would be limited by NH3-N, and they conducted exp~~riments with three loading rates in three, two-stage wetland cells. Waste water was generated from a 500-pig yr-1 farrow-tofinish facility. It was initially treated in two-stage lagoons and diluted to obtain an NH3-N concentration of about 95 mg L -I. Hydraulic loading rates were altered to obtain 11.0, 4.6, and 2.3 kg BOD ha-I day-I. The overall treatment efficiency of the wetland was affected by loading rate with the lowest rate giving over 94% removal for all parameters. However, this loading rate ofN (2.6 kg ha-1 day.I) was only 2 to 4 times greater than that used with forage grass. At the highest loading rate, NH3-N and total P werl~ applied at 11.5 and 8.0 kg ha-l,\n\n166 96 99 95 97 respectively.\n\nThe 89% and 79% mass removals ofN and P, respectively, at the highest loading rate were very encouraging. They are in general agreement with those obtained in Mississippi, and addition of a vegetative strip or some other final polishing step would likely give very high mass removals for all rates.\n\nThe research site is located in Duplin CQ., NC. It has a nursery operation of 2600 pigs (average weight = 13 kg) that uses a flushing system recirculating lagoon liquid to keep the house clean and a single-stage lagoon for primary treatment. The average liquid volume of the lagoon is 4100 m3 and the average total N inflow is 16.8 kg N d -I. On a mass basis, 83% ofN entering the lagoon is lost by ammonia volatilization or denitrification, 13% remains in the lagoon effluent, and 4% remains in the settled sludge (Szogi et al., 1996). Typically, the lagoon effluent contains 365 mg L-1ofTKN, mostly (> 95%) as ammonia, 93 mg 1.;1 TP, 1.9 g kg-1 TS, and 740 mg L-1 COD.\n\nThe focus of our research was to detennine wetland treatment efficiency of swine waste water and to define redox conditions, denitrification potentials, and agronomic cropping potentials of constructed wetlands used for swine waste water treatment (Hunt, et al., 1994;Szbgi et al., 1994). Three sets of two 3.6-by 36-m wetland cells were constructed adjacent to the lagoon in 1992; they contained either natural wetland plants or water-tolerant ~gronomic plants (Rice and soybean). Nitrogen loading rates of3 and 10 kg ha-1 day-l were used in the first and second years, respectively, by mixing the lagoon effluent with fresh water before it was applied to the wetland. The low rate was established to investigate if stream discharge requirements could be achieved with just a lagoon-wetland system. Nutrient removal efficiency was similar in both rush/bulrushes and bur-reed/cattails plant systems (Table 3). Average mass removal ofN was 94% at the loading rate of 3 kg N ha-1 day-I, but insufficient for stream discharge requirements. Nitrogen removal decreased to 68% at the higher rate of 10 kg N ha-1 day-I. Phosphorus mass removal efficiencies ranged from 40 to 100% at P loading rates < 1 kg P ha-1 day-l and varied from 20 to 80% when P loading rates were 1 to 4 kg ha-1 day-1 (data not shown). Above-ground dry matter production for rush/bulrushes and bur-reed/cattails was 12 and 33 Mg ha-l, respectivelly. Flooded rice yield was 4.5 Mg hal, and soybean grown in saturated culture yielded 2.81\\1g ha-l. Redox conditions were higWy anaerobic in the soils of all wetland cells in summer, but the higher O2 transport rates of the bulrush allowed mildly oxidized soil conditions in the winter. Denitrification enzyme assay indicated that the wetland soils were nitrate limited :for denitrification (Hunt et al., 1995a).\n\nTable 3 Nitrogen loading rates and mass removal efficiencies for the constructed wetlands, Duplin Co., NC (June 1993 -January 1995).

However, constructed wetlands do not produce an effluent acceptable for discharge. Thus, subsequent land application is necessary. Croplands, vegetative strips, and woodlands are viable options for the final treatments. Terminal land application does not require discharge permits and monitoring of discharge water quality. Therefore, it is an approach that fits well with the capacities of constructed wetlands. The capacity of mass N removal by wetlands can likely be increased by pre-wetland treatment of waste water such as overland flow, media filtration, or the use of encapsulated nitrifier technology.\n\nIn overland flow, nitrification occurs when a thin film of water is in close contact with the nitrifying population at the soil surface. It also offers the advantage of partial denitrification of NO3-N in the underlying saturated soil layer (Hunt and Lee, 1976). An overland flow treatment consisting of a 4-x20-m plot with 2% slope was constructed next to the lagoon in summer 1995 (SzOgi et al., 1996). The sides and bottom of the overland flow plot were lined with plastic and covered with 20 to 30 cm of sandy loam soil. The plot was planted to a mixture of fescue, coastal bermudagrass, and reed canary grass. Waste water was pumped from the lagoon to a storage tank, and applied as a fine spray with fixed sprinkler heads over the first 6 m of the overland flow plot. Waste water was applied for eight hours each day, five days a week, and surface and subsurface flow were collected at the end of the plot. The overland flow system had a hydraulic loading rate of2.5 cm d-1, which resulted in high rates of ammonia application (54 kg NH3-N ha-1 d -1). The high loading rate was necessary to obtain measurable surface flow at the end of the plot, but this practice is not uncommon in overland flow systems (Hegg and Turner, 1983). Data in Table 4 show that the overland flow treatment was effective in reducing the concentration ofTSS, COD, TKN, and NH3-N in both the surface and subsurface effiuents. The increase in nitrate-N concentration in both effluents is an indication that nitrification occurred. The total arnrnonia-N removal efficiency was 59%, and 10% of the total ammonia N application was recovered in the effluent as nitrate-No Humenik et aI. (1975) reported a TN efficiency of 35% for swine lagoon waste-water treated on 17-m overland flow plots with a hydraulic load of 1.8 cm d-l The total mass P removal efficiencies varied from 40 to 80% at loading rates as high as 38 kg P ha-' d-'.\n\nRecirculating media filters or trickling filters are popular among small waste generators, especially where soil conditions are not suitable for subsurface disposal systems (Rubin et al., 1994). To avoid the risk of clogging by lagoon liquid, our filtration unit used marl gravel instead of typical sand media. This modification enhanced natural aeration, and also provided rapid vertical flow rates and some phosphorus sorption. The unit consisted of a 1.8-m-diameterxO.9-m-height tank filled with the marl gravel and placed inside a second tank collecting the effluent for recirculation. Lagoon W:lste water was applied as a fine spray on the surface at hydraulic loading rates of75 L m-2 h-1 and TN loading rates of 147 g m-2. Total Suspended Solids About 50% ofTSS and COD were removed from waste water with just one cycle, and losses of TN were 11 % with one cycle and 22% with four cycles (Table 5). With four cycles, 24 to 32% of the influent TKN was converted to NO3-N. Our results with lagoon swine waste water are in agreement with the expected performance of home sewage treatment units (Hines and Favreau, 1975;Mote et al., 1991) showing that mc~dia filters can provide excellent carbon and suspended solids removal as well as a high degree of nitrification.\n\nA possible new technology for efficient nitrogen treatment is the use of encapsulated nitrifying microorganisms (Vanotti and Hunt, 1996a). This technology is widely used in drug manufacturing and food processing. Its application to municipal waste water treatment has been recently developed in Japan. With wastes rich in carbonaceous materials, such as swine waste water, the nitrifying bacteria compete poorly with heterotrophic microorganisms. Nitrifiers need lower carbon, oxygen, a surface area, and a growth phase before sufficient numbers are present for effective nitrification of swine waste water. These conditions can be provided by immobilization. The nitrifiers are entrapped in pellets (cubes) made of polyethylen glycol (pEG) or polyvinyl alcohol (pV A) polymers that are permeable to ammonia, oxygen and CO2 needed by these microorganisms, resulting in faster nitrification rates and smaller reactors. This is an important consideration for farming systems because aeration cost can be a limiting factor.\n\nNitrifying pellets were produced by a PV A-freezing method. An active culture of acclimated swine waste water nitrifying bacteria was first prepared using sludge seed from the overland flow treatment. The cells were successfully immobilized in 3-5 mm PV A polymer cubes. Using aeration only in batch experiments, nitrification of lagoon liquid started at 10 days and 69% ofNH4-N was lost by ammonia volatilization. In contrast, the waste water NH 4-N was completely oxidized in one day with the addition of nitrifying pellets and no NH3 was lost. Ammonia removal potential of nitrifying pellets were evaluated under continuous flow treatment (Vanotti and Hunt, 1996b). Pellets were added at 15.3% (w/v) [17.5% (v/v)] pellet to total tank volume ratio. Ammonia loading rates were gradually increased from 194 to a maximum of 1287 mg NH4-N per L of aeration tank per day (1.27 to 8.40 mg -N gpellet -I d-\\ respectively). Loading rates were changed by decreasing the hydraulic residence time (HR T) from 28 h to 4 h. Ammonia removal efficiencies of more than 90% were obtained with ammonia loading rates of2.73 mg N g-peller d -I and HRT of 12 h [influent NH4-N=218 ppm, the influent (nitrate+nitrite)-N=O ppm; effluent NH4-N=27 ppm, effluent (nitrate+nitrite)-N=199 ppm]. Removal efficiencies decreased to about 47% at the highest rate of 8.4 mg N g-pellet-1 d -I (HRT = 4 h). All ammonia-N removed was quantitatively converted into nitrate and nitrite forms. Nitrate was predominant (> 85%) at HR T higher than 12 h, while equal amounts of nitrate and nitrite were Iproduced at the 4 h HRT (highest load).\n\nThe rate of nitrification of swine waste water obtained with HR T of 4 h was 3.94 mg ofNH4-N g-pellet-1 d-1 (0.6 kg NH4-N mo3 d-I). On the other han~, an operation with 1000 pigs (avg. pig weight = 120 lb) needs to dispose of about 3.2 kg N per day after lagoon treatment. Thus, a small reactor with 5.3 m3 volume (-1.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 m) is required to nitrify this effluent.\n\nLiquid/solids separation before the manure solids enter the lagoon provides new alternatives for manure management. The high nutrient concentration and low moisture ofth~ separated solid fraction make this fraction a valuable material. It can be temporarily stored, processed for refeeding or transported to nutrient deficient cropland. The total nutrient load to be treated is drastically reduced, thereby increasing the life of existing lagoons. When combined with more sophisticated process designs, it can allow the use of advanced treatment methods that may eventually replace the anaerobic lagoon. But separation of suspended solids and associated nutrients from flushed waste waters using mechanical separators is very inefficient (5 to 20010) without some type of chemical coagulation to bind together the small particles of solids into larger clumps.\n\nOur evaluation ofpolyacrylarnide (PAM) flocculants (Vanotti et al., 1996) showed that these compounds are effective for flocculating suspended solids and separating nutrients from flushing effiuents. In this work, we tested 30 P AMs having a wide range of charge type and density. We found that cationic P AMs with low charge density are the best for swine waste water applications. Removal efficiencies of about 8'0% of total suspended solids, organic N and organic P were obtained with PAM rates as low as 25 ppm for waste waters having a total solids concentration of 3200 ppm, and PAM rates of 100 ppm for waste waters with 6800 ppm of total solids. It is anticipated that the removal of nutrients associated with the solids will be of great benefit to swine producers whose lagoons are of nominal size and who have limited acreage available for land application of the lagoon liquids."
