This is particularly true for biomedical diagnostics and drug-delivery, where increased drug and health care costs have prompted the need to increase the speed and efficiency of clinical diagnostic tests and drug research and development.\n\nThe high-throughput screening devices used today in chemistry, biology, and medicine are large and very expensive automated machines that require a large sample volume and often lack complete sample processing. Usually, these machines are large robotic workstations that require a large amount of space, labor, and maintenance.\n\nFurthermore, these technologies are not portable, requiring that all tests be centralized in one location. While these technologies have greatly accelerated drug discovery and have automated chemical and biological tests for numerous applications, it is clear that there is a current need for the development of new technologies that do not possess these significant drawbacks. Given the nature of these drawbacks, it is natural to develop new high-throughput screening devices not by scaling up, but by scaling down.\n\nMicrofluidic systems hold great promise for the large-scale automation and complete integration of chemical and biological tests. Microfluidics is the study and manipulation of fluid flow through channels with at least two dimensions in the micron length scale. Devices constructed with microfluidic systems have several advantages.\n\nThey are low-cost, highly portable systems that require low reagent consumption and low assay times. A wide range of microfluidic components, such as pumps, valves, mixers, and flow sensors have been demonstrated [10,11]. Such systems have the potential for a wide variety of applications, ranging from clinical diagnostics, bioseparations, microreaction technology, drug discovery, and on-chip flow-through PCR [1].\n\nA microfluidic \"LabCD TM \" has been developed for biomedical diagnostic applications and drug discovery [1,6,9]. The LabCD TM is a polymer-based CD that contains fabricated arrays of microfluidic systems on its surface. This microfluidic platform is used in conjunction with a separate electronic unit that controls the spinning velocity of the disk and contains the appropriate biosensors for data acquisition.\n\nCentrifugal forces pump the liquid through microchannels and passive capillary valves are used to gate fluid flow. By properly designing the geometry and location of the reservoirs, microchannels, and capillary valves, one can selectively control flow sequencing within the microfluidic array by varying the centrifugal pumping force.\n\nThe LabCD TM is partitioned into two separate elements. One element is the reader that contains the drive motor and biosensors for data analysis. The other element is a disposable polymer CD that contains arrays of microfluidic systems. This natural partition of functions allows the user an affordable, easy, and clean method for repeated assays.\n\nThe entire system is completely integrated. The user only needs to load the appropriate solutions to be tested (e.g., blood or urine), place the CD inside the reader, and the LabCD TM performs the remainder of the work. The user can also transmit the results via the internet to a database (e.g., hospital or doctors office) for immediate medical consultation or storage in the central data bank [1]. A diagram of the LabCD TM is shown below in Figure 1 [9]. Note that the disposable microfluidic CD platform can be designed to perform a wide variety of functions. A polymer microfluidic CD has been developed to perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [3]. ELISA is a widely used technique for the detection and quantification of biological agents, especially proteins and polypeptides. Today ELISA is carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate in a tedious and labor intensive process. Assay time typically ranges from many hours to up to 2 days.\n\nThe CD ELISA has been tested to be a completely integrated system allowing an overall assay time of about one hour for ELISA with rat IgC from hybridoma cell culture [3]. This assay time is dramatically shorter than the typical microtiter ELISA process while using fewer reagents and retaining the same detection range as the conventional method.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the design of the microfluidic ELISA CD [3]. The substrate, conjugate, washing solution, primary antibody, blocking protein, and antigen solution are preloaded into the corresponding reservoirs before the test. The flow sequence can be designed such that the first antibody is initially released at a low rotation speed. After incubation and antibody adsorption on the microchannel surface, the CD is spun at a higher rate to release the washing solution that removes all unbounded antigens. The blocking solution is then released to bind with unbounded surface sites on the channel wall. After incubating and washing, the antigen is released to complex with the antibody.\n\nAfter another period of incubating and washing, the conjugate, or second antibody, is released to complex with the antigen; this binding effectively \"sandwiches\" the antigen between the antibodies. Finally, after the last stage of incubation and washing, the substrate is released and reacts with the conjugate to produce a measurable signal. This signal is usually colorimetric or fluorescent. waste 1 st antibody blocking protein antigen sample washing solution substrate 2 nd antibody measurement waste 1 st antibody blocking protein antigen sample washing solution substrate 2 nd antibody measurement waste 1 st antibody blocking protein antigen sample washing solution substrate 2 nd antibody measurement\n\nHowever, protein adsorption on the microchannel wall can cause the surface properties to change over time. Since the presence of the bound protein will cause the polymer wall to become increasingly hydrophilic, the contact angle between the solid polymer and the liquid solution will decrease over time. Because the protein adsorption will eventually reach equilibrium, the resulting contact angle will naturally begin at an initial angle and monotonically decrease to a final equilibrium contact angle. This kinetic increase of the hydrophilicity of the polymer has an effect on the performance of the capillary valve. As a liquid flows through a sudden expansion, asymmetric intermolecular forces at the liquid-air interface generate an opposing surface tension force. If the net capillary pressure due to the surface tension force is greater than the net centrifugal pumping pressure, the capillary valve will hold the liquid. However, the magnitude of the surface tension force, and hence the opposing capillary pressure, is very sensitive to the magnitude of the contact angle. Thus, a capillary valve that initially holds a flowing fluid could fail over time as protein adsorption renders the surface increasingly hydrophilic, decreasing the contact angle and hence the opposing capillary pressure.\n\nA novel \"fishbone\" capillary valve has been developed that seeks to overcome these problems. This valve contains a series of capillary valves arranged in the shape of a \"fishbone.\" If the first fishbone (capillary valve) fails within the entire fishbone valve due to protein adsorption, the fluid will flow to the second fishbone, and then to the third, etc. These capillary valves provide the necessary redundancies to hold the fluid for a prolonged period of time when protein adsorption causes premature valve failure. A picture of the capillary fishbone valve is shown in Figure 3. The channel width is 100µm. A picture of the capillary fishbone valve halting fluid flow is shown below in to protein adsorption but the resulting flow was temporarily halted by the second fishbone. After the second fishbone fails, the third fishbone held the flow, etc. The capillary fishbone valve must have the desired burst frequencies and a sufficient hold time in order to precisely control the flow sequencing within the microfluidic system. However, in order to do so, one must have a thorough quantitative understanding of how key parameters impact the burst frequencies and hold time of a capillary fishbone valve. The fluid properties, the spin frequency of the microfluidic CD, and the geometry and location of the microchannels, reservoirs, and capillary fishbone valve will all affect the magnitude of the burst frequency.\n\nIn this thesis, rigorous theory and mathematical modeling have been applied to produce a quantitative understanding of how these key parameters affect the burst frequencies and hold time of a capillary fishbone valve. The resulting theory, models, algorithms, and MATLAB computer programs are powerful design tools for the general microfluidic CD platform discussed above, including the ELISA CD.\n\nThe fundamental fluid physics changes dramatically when the length scale is decreased to the micron level. For example, mass transport in microfluidic devices is generally dominated by viscous dissipation, and inertial effects are generally negligible [10]. Diffusion lengths are often small and the surface to volume to ratio is higher than in macroscopic systems. These can both lead to increased reaction efficiency and lower assay times as demonstrated by the microfluidic ELISA CD [3]. Fluid-surface interactions often become dominate in microfluidic systems. These interactions are important because asymmetric intermolecular forces at fluid interfaces can give rise to significant surface tension effects when the fluid is in a channel in the micron length scale. It has been shown that fluid flow in a microchannel can be stopped by introducing a sudden expansion, which generates an opposing capillary pressure due to surface tension [5]; this phenomena is the concept behind the capillary valve. In addition, fluid flow through the microchannels is usually laminar since the Reynolds number (ratio of inertial forces/viscous forces) is usually very small. With water as the working fluid, typical velocities of 1 µm/s -1 cm/s, and typical channel radii of 1-100 µm, the Reynolds number ranges between 10 -6 and 10 [10].\n\nThere are several existing techniques for the control and manipulation of fluid flow in microchannels. In general, flow can be driven electrically, thermally, or mechanically.\n\nElectrokinetically driven flows are the most popular and well-developed group of methods for pumping and driving fluid flow in the microfluidics field. Electroosmosis, electrohydrodynamics, and electrowetting are common electrokinetic manipulation techniques [1]. Electrokinetic flow has many advantages: it is easy to control the fluid using a computer-controlled voltage and a series of electrodes, it can often be used for electrochemical separations based off of size and charge differences, and it can easily be implemented in a wide number of materials (glass, quartz, polymers, etc.) using microfabrication techniques [6]. Electrokinetically driven flow also scales favorably towards miniaturization. However, it also has many disadvantages. Electrokinetic flow depends strongly upon the physiochemical properties of the fluid, particularly the pH and the ionic strength; this often makes it difficult to pump biological fluids such as blood or urine. Also, electrokinetic flow requires that the fluid be in a continuous state such that no air bubbles are present in the microchannels that break up the continuity of the fluid [10]. A large voltage is often required, reducing portability. Another issue with electrokinetic flow is that it can produce unwanted Faradaic reactions.\n\nControlling fluid flow via thermal gradients is another developing microfluidic technique. In this method, a surface is embedded with microheaters that can be selectively activated to establish local thermal gradients within a fluid droplet [12]. This thermal gradient gives rise to interfacial surface tension gradients. Since a droplet will move in a manner to lower its total associated interfacial energy, these thermal gradients will ultimately drive fluid flow. However, this technology can be difficult and expensive to implement and requires very precise control of the local fluid temperature.\n\nFluid flows can also be manipulated mechanically. Mechanical manipulation of the flow is a robust method for pumping fluids, particularly biological fluids, because the methods are insensitive to certain physiochemical fluid properties such as pH and ionic strength. A blister pouch design [9] and an acoustic pump [11] are two pressure based methods of driving fluid flow. However, the blister pouch does not miniaturize well and the acoustic pump is expensive and limits the choice of materials to piezoelectrics.\n\nThe microfluidic CD device studied in this thesis uses a centrifugal pumping force to drive fluid motion through a microchannel. In centrifugal pumping, fluid flow is driven via rotationally induced hydrostatic pressure. This mechanical pumping method is low cost, insensitive to fluid pH and ionic strength, is capable of fine flow control, and is easily integrated with information carrying capacity of the CD [1].\n\nOne of the essential components of any microfluidic system is the ability to start and stop flow. This control over the flow of liquid is usually performed with valving mechanisms. Valving mechanisms can be divided into two general categories: active valves and passive valves. Some examples of active valves include a pneumatically-controlled membrane [15], surface wetting [16], an electrochemically-controlled bubble [17], and thermally activated gels [18]. Active valves usually require an external stimuli or a moving part that is often difficult to scale down as the device becomes increasingly miniaturized.\n\nPassive valves include a hydrophobic valve [4], polymer check valve [13], elastomer valve [14], and capillary valve [9]. Passive valves provide a very flexible method for increased miniaturization of microfluidic systems. Furthermore, passive valves tend to be more cost effective than active valves. The microfluidic CD device described in this thesis uses a variation of the capillary valve known as the fishbone capillary valve. This valve and its applications are described in the Introduction. Until now, theory and mathematical modeling have not been applied to quantitatively understand the performance of the capillary fishbone valve.\n\nThe PDMS daughter mold was obtained by thoroughly mixing a 10:1 (w/w) base/curing agent of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and then degassing the mixture under vacuum for 30 minutes. It was then poured over a SU8/silicon mother mold and cured on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 hours. The SU8/Silicon mother mold was previously fabricated with the photolithographic process [2]. The PDMS daughter mold was used to produce poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA microfluidic systems with capillary valves through the microembossing process.\n\nThe PMMA microfluidic systems were created using the PDMS daughter molds and a microembossing process. PMMA pellets were stored under vacuum and inside an isothermal environment at 70 °C; these conditions allowed the PMMA pellets to remain dry and below its glass transition temperature of 105 °C. These pellets were placed on the PDMS daughter mold, which in turn was placed between two glass plates. The PMMA, PDMS, and glass plates were placed on a Carver two-post manual hydraulic press. The surface of the hydraulic press was previously elevated to 180 °C with the external temperature regulator. The hydraulic press was compressed until resistance was achieved and the system was allowed to thermally equilibrate for 15 minutes. After thermal equilibration, the melted PMMA can be compressed further and forced into the PMMA daughter mold. After allowing the system to set for 15 minutes, the mold was removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. The glass plates and PDMS daughter mold were separated from the PMMA microfluidic system. A picture of a PMMA microfluidic CD is shown below in Figure 5.\n\nThe PMMA was plasma treated to increase its hydrophobicity. Specifically, the PMMA was coated with a molecular layer of carbon hydrotriflouride (CHF 3 ). The Micro-RIE (Technics 800II RIE System) was used for the plasma treatment. The power, gas flow rate, and treatment time are 300 wattts, 50 sccm, and 2 minutes, respectively.\n\nIn order to predict the burst frequency of a fluid in a microchannel, the contact angle between the fluid and the solid must be known accurately. Since protein adsorption on the PMMA surface renders the polymer surface increasingly hydrophilic, the contact angel as a function of time must also be measured. In particular, the initial and equilibrium contact angles are important to the net hold time of the capillary fishbone valve. A device was constructed to measure the kinetic contact angle between a fluid and a solid; a schematic of this device is included in Figure 6. The PMMA chips were cleaned with distilled water, soaked in a 1.0 wt% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) protein solution for 10 minutes, and then dried with a nitrogen hose. The BSA protein treatment simulates the protein blocking step that occurs in the ELISA process.\n\nA chip of PMMA was placed on a stand, which in turn was placed in a plastic jar.\n\nThe jar was partially filled with water to establish a water vapor-liquid equilibrium to prevent evaporation during testing. A small hole was cut from the lid of the jar and covered with Scotch tape. A square section was cut out of the plastic jar and replaced with glass to ensure the microscope could view the PMMA surface and droplet. After the stand and PMMA chip was placed in the jar and the jar was partially filled with water, the environment was allowed to equilibrate for five minutes. Then, the Scotch tape on the top of the lid was removed, the pipette was inserted, and a drop of 0.2 wt% BSA protein solution was added to the PMMA drop. The pipette was removed and the Scotch tape was placed back to seal the chamber. A microscope was connected to a VCR and a computer; a digital picture of the contact angle of the droplet was taken every minute over the course of five minutes.\n\nUsing a MATLAB program, a discretized X-Y coordinate system was manually assigned along the interface of the sessile droplet. A polynomial was fit to each side of the droplet and the first derivative of the polymer was computed. This derivative was evaluated at the point where the three phases (solid-liquid-air) meet to calculate the slope of the tangent line at this point. The angle from the solid, through the liquid, and to the tangent line determines the contact angle of the droplet. The left and right contact angles of the droplet, although very similar, were averaged.\n\nThe PMMA chips were cleaned with distilled water, soaked in a 1.0 wt% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) protein solution for 10 minutes, and then dried with a nitrogen hose. Again, the BSA protein treatment simulates the protein blocking step that occurs in the ELISA process. The channels were closed with industrial Scotch tape that acts as the top channel surface.\n\nAfter cleaning and protein treatment, each chip was taped on a CD for mechanical support. The loading reservoir was loaded with a 0.2 wt% BSA solution that was previously dyed green. The system was allowed to equilibrate for 5 minutes. This CD was placed on the a motor plate designed by Gamera Bioscience, which was connected to an encoder to trigger the strobe (Monarch, DA 115/Nova Strobe) for synchronized imaging. When the same position of the CD passed under a CCD camera (Panasonic GP-KP222), the strobe is triggered. Since the CD spins at the same rate at which the strobe light is triggered, a fixed position of the CD is highlighted in each turn. The image of the CD can be captured via the CCD camera and then sent to a computer for data storage. A schematic of this setup is shown in Figure 7. A picture of the actual experimental setup for the burst frequency measurements is shown in Figure 8. It should be noted that the RPM of the CD increases by about 30 RPM's each time the spinning program's input is increased by an incremental value of one. Thus, any empirical measurement actually yields a burst frequency range; the actual burst frequency of the valve lies somewhere between the lower and upper bound of the burst frequency range. Also, it should be noted that all empirical burst frequency measurements were carried out in the clean room.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the definition of each variable that will be used in the derivations.\n\nTable 1: Definition of Variables Variable Definition wc Width of microchannel hc Depth of microchannel wf Width of fishbone valve d Distance between fishbones within a fishbone valve n Number of fishbones within a fishbone valve R 1 Distance from CD center to beginning of fluid reservoir R 2 Distance from CD center to end of fluid flow front ρ Fluid density γ Air-liquid surface tension θ Top-view contact angle (width direction) Фbot Side-view contact angle on top of channel (height direction) Фtop Side-view contact angle on bottom of channel (height direction) f Actual spin frequency of the CD fbn Burst frequency of nth fishbone in fishbone valve t j Discretized time value at time t j\n\nSurface tension force vector on top of channel from side-view (height direction) Fx,h,top X-direction surface tension force vector on top of channel from side-view (height direction) Fh,bot Surface tension force vector on bottom of channel from side-view (height direction) Fx,h,bot X-direction surface tension force vector on bottom of channel from side-view (height direction) Fw Surface tension force vector on one wall from top-view (width direction) Fx,w X-direction surface tension vector on one wall from top-view (width direction) Net Hold Time Net hold time of a capillary fishbone valve i Denotes row element i in matrix (i,j) j\n\nDenotes column element j in matrix (i,j)\n\nIn the derivations, three diagrams are provided to further illustrate the definition of these variables. A top view diagram of a liquid in a capillary fishbone valve, a side view diagram of a liquid in a capillary fishbone valve, and a top view diagram of an entire capillary fishbone valve will be shown.\n\nA top view diagram of a liquid halted in a fishbone valve due to an opposing capillary pressure is shown in Figure 9. When a liquid flowing through a microchannel reaches a sudden expansion, asymmetric intermolecular forces at the interface generate surface tension forces that oppose the flow. From the top view of the fishbone valve (width direction), a fluid will make a contact angle θ with the side walls of the channel. Since both of the side walls in the microfluidic CD are made out of the same polymer (PMMA), these two angles are identical. The surface tension force vector on one wall is Fw (surface tension force from width view), and its x-direction vector component is Fx,w.\n\nF w LIQUID wc θ θ F w F x,w F x,w F w LIQUID wc θ θ F w F x,w F x,w\n\nThe contact line for each wall is hc, the height of the channel. If the opposing surface tension force is assumed to be equal in magnitude along the height of the channel, then a mechanical force balance yields: , ( )*sin( )\n\nIt should be noted that the walls beyond the expansion in the width direction are not wetted. Thus, if the fluid is a protein solution or biological fluid, the top view contact angle θ will not decrease with time due to protein adsorption on the surface.\n\nA side view diagram of a liquid in a capillary fishbone valve is shown in Figure 10. F h,top\n\nIn the microfluidic CD platform under analysis, the height of the microchannels is constant throughout the entire microfluidic system. While a fluid flowing into a capillary fishbone valve experiences a sudden expansion in the width direction (top view), it does not experience a sudden expansion in the height direction (side view).\n\nThus, surface tension forces will promote flow in this direction rather than oppose flow.\n\nAlso, the top material (industrial Scotch tape) and the bottom material (PMMA) are different; this gives rise to a different contact angle on the top of the channel (Φtop) than the contact angle on the bottom of the channel (Φbot). The surface tension force vector on the top of the channel is channel is Fh,top (surface tension from height direction on top of channel) and its x-direction component Fx,h,top. Likewise, the surface tension force vector on the bottom of the channel is Fh,bot and its x-direction component is Fx,h,bot.\n\nIn this case, the contact line for both the top and bottom walls is wc, the width of the channel. If the surface tension force is assumed to be constant along the width of the channel, then a mechanical force balance on the top wall yields: , , ( )*cos( )\n\nA mechanical force balance on the bottom wall yields: The resulting capillary pressure generated from the expansion can be calculated by dividing the net surface tension force acting on the fluid by the channel area. ,\n\nAgain, note that the surface tension forces from the top view oppose flow and the side view surface tension forces promote flow. The area is simply the product of the width and height of the channel. Thus, substituting equations ( 1), (2), and (3) into equation ( 4) yields the net capillary pressure due to surface tension:\n\n2*sin( ) cos( ) cos( )\n\nA more thorough derivation that includes intermediate steps and calculation is included in Appendix 1.\n\nThe burst frequency of a capillary valve is defined as the spinning frequency of the CD for which the capillary valve will fail. The valve will fail when the centrifugal pumping pressure exceeds the net capillary pressure due to surface tension.\n\nThe derivative of the centrifugal pumping pressure with respect to radial CD position is:\n\nThis differential equation can be integrated from radius R 1 to R 2 to yield the final expression of the centrifugal pumping pressure:\n\nWhere ∆R is equal to (R2 -R1) and R is equal to (R1 + R2)/2. To solve for the burst frequency, the net capillary pressure due to surface tension that opposes flow (equation 5) is set equal to the centrifugal pumping pressure (equation 7). This relationship yields the final expression for the burst frequency:\n\n2 2*sin( ) cos( ) cos( ) 4 top bot fb RR wc hc hc\n\nA more thorough derivation that includes intermediate steps and calculation is included in Appendix 2.\n\nA capillary fishbone valve contains a number of \"fishbones\" that act as separate and redundant capillary valves. Each fishbone within a fishbone valve has a unique burst frequency; the burst frequency of the 1 st fishbone will naturally be higher than the burst frequency of the 2 nd fishbone since the centrifugal pumping pressure increases as the distance from the center of the CD to the flow front (R 2 ) increases. Likewise, the burst frequency of the 2 nd fishbone will be greater than that of the 3 rd fishbone, and so on.\n\nEach fishbone within a fishbone valve is a fixed distance from the last.\n\nSpecifically, this distance is the sum of the width of one fishbone (wf) plus the distance between fishbones (d). A top view diagram of an entire capillary fishbone valve is shown below in Figure 11. The fishbones are numbered from 1 to n. The width of the channel (wc), the width of the fishbone (wf), and the distance between fishbones (d) are labeled. 1 2 n wf d wc 1 2 n wf d wc\n\nTo generalize the burst frequency to equal the burst frequency of the nth fishbone, the distance from the center of the CD to the end of the fluid flow front (R 2 ) must be increased by a factor of (n-1)(wf +d). This generalized equation yields the following general relationship:\n\n[ ]\n\n( 1 ) ( ) 2\n\nThe burst frequency of the nth fishbone is a function of twelve parameters: the air/liquid surface tension, the contact angles of the liquid from the top view, the top contact angle of the liquid from the side view, the bottom contact angle of the liquid from the side view, the density of the fluid, the distance between the center of the CD and the beginning of the fluid in the reservoir, the distance between the center of the CD and the end of the fluid flow front, the width of the channel, the height of the channel, the width of a fishbone, the distance between fishbones, and the number of the fishbone within the fishbone valve. Mathematically, this can be concisely represented: , , , , , , , , , , )\n\nIf the working fluid is a biological fluid or protein solution, then protein adsorption on the channel wall will render the polymer more hydrophilic, decreasing the side view contact angles and over time. In this case, the burst frequency is also a function of time. A kinetic model for both Φtot(t) and Φbot(t) must be known in order to calculate the burst frequencies as a function of time. These kinetic models are also necessary to understand how the disparity between the initial and equilibrium contact angle will affect the performance of the capillary fishbone valve. This information combined with equation 9, can be used to calculate the theoretical hold time of a specified capillary fishbone valve. The algorithm for this calculation is discussed in section 5.2.\n\nA more thorough derivation that includes intermediate steps and calculation is included in Appendix 3.\n\nA MATLAB program has been written that calculates an array of burst frequencies for n fishbones within a capillary fishbone valve.\n\nThe program takes 12 input parameters. The user specifies the channel and fishbone geometries (wc, hc, wf, d, n), fishbone valve location (R 1 and R 2 ), fluid properties (ρ, γ), and the top and side view contact angles (θ, Фbot, Фtop). Algorithmically, this program uses a loop to calculate the burst frequency of each individual fishbone within the fishbone valve. The loop performs a number of iterations equal to the number of n fishbones within the fishbone valve; thus, the resulting array will have a number of elements equal to n. Element 1 corresponds to the burst frequency of the 1 st fishbone, element 2 corresponds to the burst frequency of the 2 nd fishbone, etc. Equation 9 is used to calculate the burst frequency of each individual fishbone during each iteration of the loop. The MATLAB program code is included in Appendix 4. A sample output to this program is included in Appendix 5.\n\nThis program assumes that all parameters are independent of time. This assumption is valid when the working fluid does not alter the surface properties of the polymer over the time. For the calculation of kinetic burst frequencies and the net hold time of the fishbone valve, please see the next MATLAB program and its corresponding algorithm (section 5.2).\n\nA MATLAB program has been written that calculates the theoretical hold time of a fishbone valve under user specified conditions.\n\nThe program takes 11 input parameters and 2 input functions. The user specifies the channel and fishbone geometries (wc, hc, wf, d, n), fishbone valve location (R1, R2), fluid properties (ρ, γ), the top view contact angle (θ), kinetic models for the side view contact angles as a function of time (Фbot(t) and Фtop(t)), and the actual spin frequency of the disk (f). The kinetic models are discretized into a number of elements equal to the number of j elements of the defined time vector t.\n\nThere are three general cases that occur when calculating the hold time of a fishbone. In the first case, the actual spin frequency of the disk exceeds the burst frequency of each fishbone within the fishbone valve over the entire time domain. In this case, the fluid will simply burst through each individual fishbone in the fishbone valve such that the hold time of the capillary fishbone valve is zero. In the second case, the actual spin frequency of the disk is below the burst frequency of each fishbone in the fishbone valve over the entire time domain. The hold time of the capillary fishbone valve in this case will be infinite; the valve will hold indefinitely until the CD is accelerated to a sufficient RPM where the centrifugal pumping pressure exceeds the net capillary pressure due to surface tension. The third case occurs when the actual spin frequency of the disk is less than the burst frequency of the first fishbone at time zero, but the burst frequency of the fishbone falls below the actual spin frequency of the disk at some time t j due to protein adsorption. The redundancies within the capillary fishbone valve are specifically designed for this case. The overall hold time of a capillary fishbone valve is simply the sum of the individual hold times of each fishbone within the valve.\n\nThe three general cases can be summarized as follows:\n\ni. Case #1:\n\nf > fbn for all t j and for all n Net Hold Time = 0\n\nii. Case #2:\n\nf < fbn for all t j and for all n Net Hold Time = ∞\n\niii. Case #3:\n\nf < fb1 at t = 0 for first fishbone f > fb1 for t = t j for first fishbone (Hold Time) ith fishbone = t j for which f > fbi Net Hold Time = ∑(Hold Time) ith fishbone A MATLAB program was written to calculate the net theoretical hold time of a capillary fishbone valve. First, the MATLAB program calculates a matrix of burst frequencies. Each row corresponds to the nth fishbone within the fishbone valve and each column corresponds to a discretized time value (t j ) as specified by the kinetic model for the side view contact angles. Thus, matrix element (i,j) represents the burst frequency of the i th fishbone at discretized time value t j . Each row can be thought of as a \"kinetic burst frequency\" for the i th fishbone. The program uses equation 9 to calculate the burst frequencies. The program also asks the user if he or she wishes to display this burst frequency matrix for reference as part of the program output.\n\nAfter the matrix of burst frequencies has been calculated, the actual spin frequency of the disk is systematically compared with each value in this matrix to determine the overall hold time of the capillary fishbone valve. Algorithmically, the program uses a nested loop to compare these values. The outer loop performs a number of iterations equal to the number of n fishbones present in the fishbone valve; this number is equal to i number of rows in the burst frequency matrix. The inner loop performs a number of iterations equal to the number of values of discretized time t j as specified by the kinetic contact angle model; this number is equal to j number of columns in the burst frequency matrix.\n\nThe outer loop begins with the first fishbone (row i = 0) and then moves sequentially to the nth fishbone (row i = n -1). When the program checks the first fishbone, it compares the actual spin frequency of the disk with the calculated burst frequency of the fishbone at time value t = 0. If the actual spin frequency is greater than the burst frequency, then the valve will fail. If the valve fails, it assigns a value of \"false\" to a defined logic operator and assigns a hold time value for this fishbone as equal to the current time element t j (in the case of immediate valve failure, the hold time for the first fishbone is zero). The program then breaks from the inner time loop to start a burst frequency comparison of the next fishbone in the outer loop. However, if the actual spin frequency is less than the burst frequency of the first fishbone, then the valve will hold.\n\nIn this case, the program will assign a value of \"true\" to a defined logic operator and it will move in the inner loop to the next burst frequency associated with the next time element t = t j . Using the same algorithm, it will then compare the actual spin frequency of the disk with the burst frequency of the fishbone evaluated at this time. If the actual spin frequency exceeds the burst frequency at t = t j , the hold time = t j for this fishbone and the logic operator is assigned a value of \"false.\" If the actual spin frequency is less than or equal to the burst frequency, then the valve holds, the logic operator is assigned a value of \"true,\" and the program moves on to the next fishbone burst frequency associated with the next time value t j .\n\nIf the first fishbone valve within the fishbone does not fail over the entire time domain (i.e. the initial and equilibrium contact angles are sufficient to halt the fluid flow), then the entire capillary valve will hold the fluid and the capillary fishbone valve hold time is infinite at these conditions. This occurrence is identical to \"Case 2.\" In this case, the program will have assigned a final value of \"true\" for the defined logic operator. If this logic operator has a value of true after execution of the nested loop, then the program will output an infinite hold time.\n\nLikewise, if the first fishbone within the fishbone valve fails at some time over the entire time domain (i.e. there exists a time t j at which the actual spin frequency exceeds the burst frequency), then each of the subsequent fishbones will ultimately fail because the first fishbone has the largest burst frequency of all of the fishbones. In this case, the program will have a final value of \"false\" for the defined logic operator. It should be noted that at this time no experimental work has been performed regarding the fishbone hold time. As a result, two kinetic models for Фbot(t) and Фtop(t)\n\nhave been arbitrarily chosen to clearly illustrate the concept of the capillary fishbone hold time. The time vector has been discretized into 6 values, ranging from 0 min to 5 min in increments 1 min. This small number was arbitrarily chosen to clearly illustrate the utility of the MATLAB program. In practice, the kinetic models would be determined experimentally and discretized into a larger number of elements.\n\nIn order to predict the burst frequency of a fluid in a microchannel, the contact angle between the fluid and the solid must be known accurately. Empirical kinetic contact angle measurements were performed between the desired substrate and a 0.2 wt% BSA protein solution in a sealed chamber (experimental method 3.4). A 0.2 wt% BSA protein solution is used because it is representative of many biological fluids or protein solutions that are often used in ELISA. Three replicates were performed of each measurement.\n\nFour PMMA substrates were tested: plasma treated and protein treated, plasma treated but not protein treated, protein treated but not plasma treated, and finally PMMA that was neither protein treated nor plasma treated. Protein treated industrial Scotch Tape was also tested. The channels of the PMMA microfluidic systems are currently closed with industrial Scotch tape which acts as the top channel surface.\n\nThe plasma treatment was performed using the method detailed in section 3.3. In order to protein treat a substrate, it was first cleaned with distilled water, soaked in a 1.0 wt% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) protein solution for 10 minutes, and then dried with a nitrogen hose. The BSA protein treatment simulates the protein blocking step that occurs in the ELISA process.\n\nEmpirically, it has been found that contact angle reaches equilibrium within 2 -3 minutes. As a result, the initial (0 min) and equilibrated (5 min) contact angles were measured for each of the substrates listed above. The results are summarized in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Initial and Equilibrium Contact Angles Substrate Material Plasma Treated Protein Treated Initial Contact Angle (0 min) Equilibrium Contact Angle (5 min) ∆ PMMA N N 73 68 5 PMMA N Y 74 42 32 PMMA Y Y 80 68 12 PMMA Y N 108 106 2 Scotch Tape N Y 106 105 1\n\nProtein treatment decreases the initial contact angle and also increases the magnitude of the contact angle change between the initial and equilibrium contact angles.\n\nDue to protein treatment, the initial contact angle change was essentially negligible (~1 degree) between the plasma free PMMA samples while the initial contact angle change was very large (~28 degrees) between the plasma treated PMMA samples. Clearly, protein adsorption significantly disrupts the increased hydrophobic effect from the molecular layer of carbon hydrotriflouride. The magnitude of the decrease between the initial and equilibrium contact angles is greater for the protein treated samples versus the non-protein treated samples. This observation holds between both the plasma treated PMMA samples (~10 degrees) and plasma free PMMA samples (~27 degrees).\n\nPlasma treatment increases the initial contact angle and also decreases the magnitude of the contact angle change between the initial and equilibrium contact angles.\n\nDue to plasma treatment, the initial contact angle change was very large (~35 degrees) between the non-protein treated PMMA samples while the initial contact angle change was much smaller (~6 degrees) between the protein treated PMMA samples. The magnitude of the decrease between the initial and equilibrium contact angles is less for the plasma treated samples than the plasma free samples. This decrease is greater between the protein treated PMMA samples (~20 degrees) than for the non-protein treated PMMA samples (~3 degrees).\n\nInterestingly, the kinetic contact angle change between the 0.2 wt% BSA solution and the Scotch Tape was essentially negligible (~1 degree), indicating that very little protein adsorbed on the Scotch Tape surface.\n\nThe initial contact angle between the 0.2 wt% BSA solution and the plasma treated and protein treated PMMA is shown below in Figure 12. The equilibrium contact angle is shown below in Figure 13. Note the slight decrease in the contact angle between the liquid and the solid. note. A value of 80 degrees was assigned to θ, the top view contact angle. Since the polymer does not wet the side channel of the fishbone, the initial (0 min) contact angle between the 0.2 wt% BSA solution and the plasma treated -protein treated PMMA surface should be used. For the side view contact angle on the top surface, Фtop, a value of 105 degrees of was used. This value reflects the contact angle between the 0.2 wt% BSA solution and the protein-treated Scotch Tape after the surface has been wetted for at least five minutes. A value of 68 degrees was assigned to Фbot, the side view contact angle on the bottom surface. This value reflects the contact angle between the 0.2 wt% BSA solution and the plasma treated -protein treated PMMA after the surface has been wetted for at least five minutes. The details of the theoretical vs. empirical results for each of the five fishbone capillary valves are included in Appendix 9.\n\nSoon after the completion of this thesis, new microfluidic CD platforms with tighter manufacturing tolerances for the channel geometries will be available. These CD's were designed in AutoCAD with precise specifications. This design was sent to Ritek Corporation for high precision manufacturing. The empirical burst frequency measurements obtained from these CD's will be much more accurate, allowing the mathematical models and algorithms to be tested with further rigor. In addition, a larger sample size will be used in conjunction with these more accurate empirical measurements.\n\nTheory and mathematical modeling have been applied to quantitatively understand the behavior of the novel capillary fishbone valve. The general equation for the burst frequency of the nth fishbone within a capillary fishbone valve has been derived\n\n(equation 9). The fluid properties, the spin frequency of the microfluidic CD, and the geometry and location of the microchannels, reservoirs, and capillary fishbone valve will all affect the magnitude of the burst frequency (equation 10).\n\nAn algorithm has been developed to calculate the theoretical hold time of a capillary fishbone valve (section 5.2). This algorithm utilizes the derived burst frequency equations and kinetic models for the side view contact angle change with time.\n\nTwo user-friendly MATLAB computer programs have been written. One program calculates the burst frequency of the nth fishbone and the other program calculates the theoretical fishbone hold time in response to the key input parameters.\n\nThese programs implement the models and algorithms in an easy-to-use form.\n\nIt should be noted that the theory, derivations, algorithms, and MATLAB computer programs described in this thesis are powerful design tools for the creation of the next generation microfluidic CD platform. In particular, it is now possible to maximize the theoretical burst frequency differences between sets of fishbone capillary valves. Also, it is now possible to estimate how many fishbones are needed within a capillary fishbone valve to yield the desired hold time. These calculations are in alignment with the original research objective, which was to increase the robustness and precision of the flow sequencing for the microfluidic CD platform.\n\n851.5878 834.7367 820.8045 809.3092 799.8398 792.0488 833.5364 817.0425 803.4056 792.1540 782.8853 775.2595 816.4771 800.3208 786.9630 775.9417 766.8627 759.3929 800.3213 784.4846 771.3912 760.5879 751.6886 744.3666 784.9910 769.4577 756.6150 746.0188 737.2898 730.1081 ************MATLAB Program Output (CASE 2)************ This program calculates the theoretical hold time (min) of a capillary fishbone valve with n fishbones. >>>>> CHANNEL & FISHBONE GEOMETRY <<<<< Width of the channel (micrometers): 100 Height of the channel (micrometers): 100 Width of the fishbones (micrometers): 100 Distance between fishbones (micrometers): 100 Number of fishbones (integer): 5 >>>>> FLUID PROPERTIES <<<<< Air/Liquid surface tension of the fluid (mN/m): 72.9 Density of the fluid (g/cm^3): 1 >>>>> FISHBONE VALVE POSITION <<<<< R1 (micrometers): 25000 R2 (micrometers): 30000 >>>>> SETTINGS <<<<< Spin Frequency (RPM): 800 >>>>> PREFERENCES <<<<< Would you like to display the burst frequencies of each of the individual fishbones?
