INTRODUCTION 1 .I Wellbore Heat Exchanger Concept and Description\n\nAlthough engineered geothermal systems (EGSs) are typically thought of as being either permeability-limited or fluid-limited, in an extreme EGS condition there is neither sufficient permeability to induce flow nor working fluid to circulate through the rock formation. Under this condition, heat extraction via circulation in a wellbore has been proposed as a means of geothermal power generation or for direct use applications (Kohl, Brenni, and Eugster 2002;Lund 2003).\n\nThe wellbore heat extraction (WBHX) concept can be described as injecting and circulating cold fluid down the annulus and up the tubing for production at the surface. There exists no contact between the working fluid in the well and the reservoir other than heat conduction across the well perimeter itself. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the wellbore heat exchanger model. The wellbore consists of the tubing, insulation, casing, and cement. The well is cased and cemented to a certain depth, and the remaining portion of the well is retained as an open hole. The tubing is insulated and extends to the bottom of the wellbore. The fluid is injected into the annulus. As it descends it gains heat from the formation due to conduction. The hot fluid then rises up through the tubing to the surface. Power generation can take place either at the surface or downhole, but as is described in a later section, the temperature differences between the two are minimal because of the high flow rate through the tubing.\n\nCemFnt Ayulus Tubing Insulation Casing Tation Our study evaluated the potential for power generation usin the WBHX concept. We examined operational parameters such as circulation rates, well geometry and depth, working fluids, and regional variables such as heat flux and formation thermal properties. This work is an extension of preliminary studies conducted at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL; Finger 2003 [personal communication]), and comprises a comprehensive numerical evaluation of the proposed method for geothermal power production.\n\nUnsuccessful wells previously drilled in the pursuit of permeable resources for oil production or geothermal fluids are potentially reusable as wellbore heat exchangers in regions where there is a reasonable thermal energy content. The low capital costs of an existing well makes the wellbore heat exchanger an attractive option. The two main heat transfer processes involved are heat transfer from the formation to the wellbore by thermal conduction and heat transfer by the fluid through advection. The fluid advection process is faster when compared to thermal conduction from the formation to the wellbore. This report describes the physical and numerical aspects of the wellbore heat exchanger model. Kohl et al. (2002) analyzed the operation of a 2,302-m (7,552.5-ft)-deep borehole heat exchanger at Weggis, Switzerland, which was being used for space heating and domestic hot water purposes. They concluded that the heat exchanger was not being operated at optimal conditions, and that the produced thermal energy rate could be increased from the present value of 40 kW (136.5e+3 BTUh) to 180 kW (6 14.2e+3 BTUh) by optimizing the circulation rate. After conducting a numerical sensitivity analysis on the circulation and recovery period cycles, they concluded that the long-term performance would not be affected by a variation of the cycle interval, provided they used identical total circulation, recovery periods, and identical flow rates. Based on a sensitivity study of insulation thermal conductivity and circulation temperatures, they concluded that a higher degree of insulation on the tubing and lower injection temperatures would increase the thermal power that could be extracted from borehole heat exchanger systems. In our project, we conducted a more extensive sensitivity study of all operating and design variables, including the circulation rate and tubing properties. Lund (2003) provides information on the use and installation of downhole heat exchangers for direct heating applications. Lund's paper demonstrates that wellbore heat exchangers are a viable option for direct heating applications. Abe et al. (1999) summarizes the present status of hot dry rock systems and their economical aspects. Their paper made several important observations about the thermal energy production and its conversion to electrical energy in hot dry rock systems. According to their study, a resource that can return water to the surface at temperatures of 150°C (302°F) or higher appear to be a minimum requirement for electrical power production using current technologies; however, temperatures of about 80-90°C (176194°F) could be practical for direct use applications. They also suggest that even a small commercial geothermal power plant producing, for instance, 5 MW (1.706e+7 BTUh) of electricity from water at 150°C (302°F) would require flow rates on the order of 2378 gpm (137.5 kg/s). These produced fluid temperature requirements for commercial geothermal power production also apply to wellbore heat exchanger systems. Kanev et al. (1997) conducted numerical investigations to study the impact of heat loss from the geothermal wellbore on produced fluid temperatures and pressures. Their study identifies flow rate as a key parameter in determining the wellhead conditions, with elapsed time and geothermal gradient playing secondary roles. Ramey (1961) derived an approximate solution to the wellbore heat transmission problem that could be used to predict the bottomhole temperature of the fluid when it is injected at the surface. The assumptions used in deriving the analytical solution were that (a) heat flows in the radial direction in the formation; (b) heat transmission in the wellbore is rapid compared to heat flow in the formation, hence, could be represented by steady-state solutions; and (c) physical and thermal properties of the earth and wellbore fluids do not vary with temperature. Bobok and Toth (2002) developed a mathematical model of dry (wellbore) hole heat exchangers and conducted numerical simulation to predict its thermal behavior. To determine the heat flux around the well, the mathematical model developed by Bobok and Toth used a time function that was derived from solutions for radial heat conduction from an infinitely long cylinder (Ramey [ 19611). Their numerical simulation study conducted for the circulation rates showed that with increasing circulation rates, the outflowing water temperature decreases, and that only small-scale utilizations could be based on the dry hole heat exchangers.\n\nA more complex and transient system was solved for using the numerical simulator TETRAD (Vinsome and Shook, 1993), which uses fully implicit numerical methods. A parametric sensitivity study was conducted to determine the thermal behavior of wellbore heat exchangers.\n\nOur main objectives for this project were to: Determine the effects of parameter variation on wellbore heat exchanger performance by comparing and analyzing the effluent fluid temperature and ideal work extraction rate from each case study Evaluate the viability of elektric power generation in wellbore heat exchangers by determining the power generated from the best case scenario that was constructed using the optimal design parameters and operating conditions obtained from the parametric sensitivity study\n\nWe used a multiphase, multicomponent, three-dimensional TETRADv13.3 simulator to conduct numerical investigations. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the wellbore heat exchanger. The well model in TETRAD is coded as a source/sink term, but to simulate the WBHX phenomena for this study, we constructed a complex numerical model with each of the g-id properties and parameters assigned so as to represent the various elements of the wellbore and formation. The different elements of the wellbore heat exchanger model are the tubing, insulation, casing, cement, and formation. With some exceptions (natural fluid convection effects case) the four sides of the domain are surrounded by no-flow boundaries. A basal heat flux boundary condition is given at the base of the domain and a surface heat loss boundary condition is given at the top of the domain to maintain isothermal conditions. The circulation fluid mass rate and temperature are specified as input. Negligible resistance to flow in the z-direction in a wellbore heat exchanger was made possible by assigning very high vertical permeabilities. Lateral mixing of the working fluid in the cells representing the annulus and tubing was allowed. The transmissibility across the inner tubing-liquid interface, outer insulation-liquid interface, and formation-wellbore interface was set to a very small value to prevent communication between the formation and wellbore.\n\n. Numerical model of wellbore heat exchanger (not to scale).\n\nWe used the following assumptions in developing the numerical wellbore model:\n\nThermal conduction and advection are the predominant heat transfer mechanisms in the wellbore and formation. Radiation heat transfer, considered negligible, was not included. Heat transfer, as described by Newton's law of cooling at the wall-fluid interface, is treated as a heat conduction term.\n\nNewtonian working fluid is circulated in the wellbore. Fluid density is variable as a function of pressure and temperature.\n\nWorking fluid does not enter the formation and does not mix with the in situ reservoir fluids.\n\nFormation thermal properties are constant.\n\nTwo phase flow regimes in the wellbore were not incorporated. Only the liquid phase working fluid case was studied.\n\nThe frictional pressure drop loss in the wellbore was neglected.\n\nLocal thermal equilibrium exists.\n\nTETRAD is a multiphase, multicomponent, three-dimensional reservoir simulator that has been extensively used to model flow in porous/fractured media (Vinsome and Shook, 1993). Two phases (water and gas phases) and Nc components exist in the geothermal model, which may partition among any of the phases. There will be Nc molar conservation equations and one energy conservation equation.\n\nwhere ujis the phase advective flux given by the following multiphase version of Darcy's law:\n\nand qi is a component source/sink term that accounts for the injection or extraction of component i.\n\nwhere qE represents the energy source/sink term, the following phase internal energies are given by: and the phase enthalpies are given by:\n\nIn this wellbore heat exchanger model, the above general formulation in TETRAD takes the simplified form described in this section.\n\nOne molar conservation equation and one energy conservation equation exist for the single-phase liquid in the wellbore which consists of a single component. Both the liquid and vapor phases could be present in the formation, but since each phase contains only pure component, there would again be only a single molar conservation equation and energy conservation equation to solve for; thus, the wellbore heat exchanger model solves for one mass conservation and one energy conservation equation.\n\nThe mass conservation equation in the wellbore section is:\n\nThe fluid circulation rate is maintained at a constant value specified as the following input data:\n\nwhere qW is a component source/sink term which is the input mass flux in the annulus and a sink term in the tubing.\n\nThe energy conservation equation in the wellbore section is:\n\nSimilarly, the general mass conservation and energy equations would be simplified for the formation.\n\nA preliminary study was conducted at SNL using their wellbore simulator GEOTEMP (Mondy and  Duda, 1984). We elected to extend that study using the TETRAD simulator (Vinsome and Shook 1993). The reasons we chose the TETRAD simulator are as follows: 0 GEOTEMP has static fluid in the formation, while in TETRAD the fluid in formation, in a few case studies, is allowed to undergo natural convection and change in phases.\n\nThe gridding in the radial direction increases exponentially in GEOTEMP, while in TETRAD, individual grid dimensioning is allowed; hence, a variable radial ,gidding scheme was used to model the various elements with varying thickness, different physical and thermal properties in the wellbore heat exchanger.\n\nTETRAD allowed us to define various boundary conditions such as the heat loss at the surface, basal heat flux, and a no-flow/pressure boundary at the edges.\n\nTETRAD has many numerical controls that facilitate a smooth convergence of the Newtonian iterations.\n\nTETRAD has many output options that provide a better estimate of the fluid temperature profiles, histones, and fluid velocities etc.\n\nWe first ran an adequate set of validation cases, and compared TETRAD and GEOTEMP results.\n\n0 0 0 0\n\nWe then conducted the sensitivity case study using TETRAD. Details of the validation exercise arc described in the remainder of this section.\n\nThe wellbore used in our calibration study had an outside diameter of 244.5 mm (9.625 in.) and was 1,828.8 m (6,000 ft) deep, with 762.0 m (2,500 ft) cemented and cased. The insulated tubing had an outside diameter of 91.44 mm (3.6 in.) and was 7.62 mm (0.3 in.) thick. The cemented casing thickness was 13.97-mm (0.55-in.). The bilinear temperature profile assigned to the wellbore formation was 26.7\"C (80°F) at the surface, 121.1 1°C (250°F) at the 609.6-m (2,000-ft) depth, and 176.67\"C (350°F) at the 1,828.8-m (6,000-ft) depth. The fluid injected into the annulus was 26.7\"C (80\"F), and the hot fluid was produced from the tubing. Fluid return temperatures were compared for both 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) and 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rates. Table 1 gives the thermal properties used for this model. Injection of fluid was treated as mass influx and production was treated as a sink term.\n\nThermal Conductivity (W/m\"C) Insulated tubing 3.46 Cement 0.87 Casing 45.35 Working fluid (water) 0.69 Formation 3.46 Volumetric Heat Capacity (kJ/m3\"C) 3,614.86 1,394.97 3,6 14.86 4,186.80 2,816.77\n\nWe calibrated the TETRAD model with the GEOTEMP model using the input for the SNL case to quantify differences in predicted performance. As can be seen in Figure 3, a good agreement exists between the 20 gpm (1.26 kgh) circulation rate and the 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate where, despite some differences in the transient stage, over long periods the solutions come closer to being equal. When production is initiated, the fluid at the bottom of the hole rises up through the tubing.\n\n160 ---Geotemp-100 gpm 40 -20 140 A 120 E E 100 E 80 E ' 60 3 C --.\n\n------__--_ If there were no fluid mixing and perfect insulation, we would expect the maximum peak fluid return temperature to be the same as the bottomhole fluid temperature of 176.7\"C (350°F). At 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) and 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) circulation rates, the fluid residence time in tubing was calculated to be 0.015 and 0.075 day, respectively. For the 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate, TETRAD gives a peak temperature of 137.8\"C (280°F) at 0.019 day, while GEOTEMP gives a peak temperature of 65.1\"C (149°F) at 0.025 day. For the 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) circulation rate, TETRAD gives a peak temperature of 135.3\"C (276°F) at 0.1 day, while GEOTEMP gives a peak temperature of 128.3\"C (263°F) at 0.15 day. TETRAD calculated the peak fluid returns temperature and time of peak temperature closer to the bottom fluid temperature and the tubing fluid residence time (\"bottoms up\" time), respectively. This intuitively indicates that TETRAD credibly represented the flow in the tubing. This comparison of simulations does not necessarily mean the results are accurate, but disagreement would identify an issue of concern.\n\nFigure 4 shows the areal grid refinement employed in the numerical model. The areal gridding was varied from 19 to 23 and to 29 cells, at which a convergent solution was obtained. Figure 5 shows the areal grid refinement plot. Similarly, a vertical grid refinement was done and a cell height of 30.5 m (100 ft) led to a convergent solution. Figure 6 shows the vertical grid refinement plot.\n\nTubing inner diameter -76.2 mm Tubing outer diameter -88.9 mm\n\nBasal heat flux -0.1 W/m' Formation thermal conductivity -1.73 W/m\"C\n\nWe developed a computer simulation model that we felt accurately represented the well, casing, and tubing configurations that would be used in a wellbore heat exchanger type of application as a base case for the sensitivity study. The most notable differences between the calibration case and the base case were the properties of the formation type used-the bottomhole temperature and the wellbore diameter. The base case consisted of a 3 11 mm (12.25 in.) diameter well drilled vertically to 5,593 m (18,350 ft). The top 762 m (2,500 ft) of the well was cased and cemented; the balance of the well was an open hole. Tubing extended to the bottom of the wellbore. The tubing was 6.35 mm (0.25 in.) thick with an internal diameter of 76 mm (3 in.), and was covered by 6.35 mm (0.25 in.) of insulation. The tubing and casing were made of steel, the insulation of magnesia (the formation has properties typical of sandstone), and water was used. The well depth was calculated assuming a surface temperature of 26.7\"C (SOOF), a bottomhole temperature of 350°C (662\"F), a basal heat flux of 0.1 W/m2 (0.03 17 BTU/ft'.h), and a uniform formation effective thermal conductivity of 1.73 W/m\"C (0.9996 BTU/ft.h.\"F). The properties selected for the base case were considered representative of geothermal drilling and completion operations (Lide 1993; h a t s 1986), but varied in subsequent sensitivity studies. The base case properties are summarized in Table 2. The base case wellbore geometry is plotted to scale in Figure 7.\n\nWellbore diameter -3 1 1 mm Well depth -5,593 m\n\nThe wellbore was filled with water, which was in thermal equilibrium with the formation. At t = 0 a constant volumetric rate of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) was injected in the annulus and fluids were produced from the tubing. The simulation time period was selected as 5 years (1,826 days). The thermal resistance offered by tubing and insulation helped in preserving the k,,ermal energy content in the fluid, while the thermal resistance offered by the casing and cement hindered the thermal energy flow from the formation to the fluid. Although a lumped parameter approach was not taken in this study, an effective heat transfer coefficient for the cased vs. uncased portion of the well was determined as described in Appendix A. The overall heat transfer coefficient for the base case was 10.26 W/m'\"C (1.807 BTU/ft'.h.\"F) for the cased portion of the well and 11.74 W/m'\"C (2.068 BTU/ ft'.h.\"F) for the open portion. The base case input data file is included in Appendix B.\n\nThe results analyzed and reported are the produced fluid temperature and ideal work extraction rate. The second law of thermodynamics allows one to quantify the limit placed on the conversion of heat to work through the definition of ideal energy. Ideal energy is that portion of energy that could be converted into work by ideal processes, which bring the energy source to a dead state-a state in equilibrium with the earth and its atmosphere. Ideal work was calculated from the produced liquid enthalpy and entropy at wellhead conditions, and ambient conditions of 26.7\"C (80°F) and 1.0 atm (14.7 psi). This available energy or ideal work rate represents the maximum power that an energy conversion system could produce when using an energy source (geothermal) to generate electricity. We discuss realistic conversion efficiency using the optimum parameters in Section 7.\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the produced fluid temperature history for the base case. A maximum produced temperature of 253°C (487.4\"F) is observed at approximately 0.1 days (well bottom fluid produced at the surface). The temperature falls quickly, and enters a pseudosteady-state (PSS) behavior at about 500 days. We define PSS as the period wherein the temperature decline is linear and small. Figures 9 and 10 plot the temperature profile in the radial direction at 5 days and 500 days at depths of 351 m (1,152 ft), 3,033 m (9,95 1 ft) and 4,557 m (14,95 1 ft) below land surface. At the onset of PSS, the effluent temperature (Tpss) is approximately 84°C (183\"F), and declining at O.O06\"C/day (0.0108 \"F/day). Figure 11  work extraction rate history plot. At PSS, ideal work is 129 kW (440.2e+3 BTUh), and is declining by approximately 22 W/day (75.07 BTUMday). 0 , I 300 { . . . . . . : : : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . : : : i : : . . . j / / . . .

This study included an analysis of the wellbore geometry, working fluid properties, circulation rate, and regional properties of heat flux, formation rock type, and natural convection effects.

The fluid return temperature histories for the three circulation rates are shown in Figure 12. Pseudosteady-state temperatures ranged from 40-125°C (104-257°F). An increase in circulation rate by 5 times, from 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) to 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) to 500 gpm (31.5 kg/s), led to a decrease in temperature from 123°C (253°F) to 84°C (183°F) and to 40°C (104\"F), respectively, at 500 days (onset of the PSS condition). There was an absolute percentage loss in temperature of 32% when the circulation rate was increased from 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) to 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s), and a temperature loss of 5 1% when the circulation rate was increased from 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) to 500 gprn (3 1.5 kg/s) at the onset of PSS. Reductions in the maximum temperature observed are due to increased mixing at lower injection rates. The total fluid residence times in the wellbore for 500 gpm (31.5 kg/s), 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s), and 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s) were 0.14,0.70, and 3.48 days, respectively. Owing to its small residence time of 0.14 day, the 500 gpm (3 1.5 kg/s) circulation rate could not obtain heat fast enough. Variations in effluent temperature are due to the fluid residence time-the larger the residence time, the higher the produced temperature. This can be misleading, however, as is discussed in the following paragraph.\n\nFigure 13 shows the ideal work extraction rate history for the three circulation rates. The PSS ideal work extraction rates are 68 kW (232.0e+3 BTU/h), 129 kW (440.2e+3 BTUh), and 45 kW (153.5e+3 BTUh) for 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s), 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s), and 500 gpm (31.5 kg/s), respectively. Ideal work is a function of both effluent temperature and circulation rate. These work to offset one another, so there is an optimum circulation rate that balances the adverse effects of high effluent temperatures at low circulation rates with low effluent temperatures at high rates. Conversion of the high effluent temperature of 123°C (253°F) into ideal work rate was low because of the low circulation rate of 20 gpm (1.26 kg/s). Similarly, utilization of the thermal energy output at 500 gpm is low because of the low fluid output temperature of 40°C (104°F). Figure 14 is a plot of the produced fluid temperatures and ideal work as a function of circulation rates at PSS. This plot shows that the optimal circulation rate among the three cases studied was 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) since the ideal work extraction rate is a maximum.  --180 160 -140 E p! 120 =I Q, 100 80 e 60 40 't --Ideal Work Rate -1 + 160 140 x 120 F Y Q e 80 p 60 Q 2 40 100 3 a , , ' 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 0 Circulation Rate (gpm) 04-GA5000871-11 Figure 14. Plot of produced fluid temperature and ideal work extraction rates as a function of circulation rate at 500 days (PSS) illustrating an optimal circulation rate of 100 gpm.\n\nRecognizing that contact surface area between the fluid and formation and residence time strongly affect ideal work rate, a logical wellbore modification is to increase its diameter. We varied the wellbore diameter from the base case value of 3 11 mm (12.25 in.) to 660.4 mm (26 in.). Temperature histories for these runs are given in Figure 15. At 500 days, the fluid returns temperature was 84°C (183°F) for the 311 mm (12.25 in.) diameter wellbore and 95°C (203°F) for the 660.4 mm (26 in.) diameter wellbore. Despite increasing the residence time by a factor of 5.0 and the contact surface area by a factor of 2.0, Tpss differs by only 11°C (19.8\"F), a 13% increase. The ideal work extraction rates are 129 kW (440.2e+3 BTUh) and 179 kW (610.8e+3 BTUh) for the 311 mm (12.25 in.) and 660.4 mm (26 in.) diameter wellbores, respectively, at 500 days. Ideal work at PSS (see Figure 16) increased by a factor of 1.4 with the larger wellbore. Thus, while increasing wellbore diameter enhances energy extraction, the improvements are likely offset by increased costs of drilling and casing the larger well.\n\n-300\n\n- -----_  400 -350 i l F 300 c U 9, 250 2 * 200 -150 m 9, E 100 50 0 1 0 500 1000 1500 2( Figure 16. Ideal work extraction rate histories for the two wellbore diameters. The 660.4 m wellbore diameter has the higher ideal work extraction rate.\n\nWe varied the wellbore casing length to study its effect on the wellbore heat exchanger performance. We ran three different cases with cemented casing lengths of 1,524 m (5,000 ft) for Case 1, 3,048 m (10,000 ft) for Case 2, and 4,572 m (15,000 ft) for Case 3. The circulation rate was maintained at 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s). The effective thermal conductivity of steel casing and cement combined was 1.1 W/m\"C (0.6356 Btu/ft.h\"F), its combined effective volumetric heat capacity was 1,693 kJ/m3\"C (25.23 BTU/ft3\"F), and the effective thermal diffusivity was 6.4973e-7 m2/s (6.9936e-6 ft'/s). Heat transfer from a conductive regime into an advecting regime is directly proportional to thermal conductivity and inversely proportional to the square root of thermal diffusivity (WK' [1,365 J/m2ds\"C(6.6777e-2 BTU/ft'ds\"F)]), where K is thermal conductivity and K is the thermal diffusivity (Carslaw and Jaeger 1959). The fluid residence time in the annulus is 0.65 day (base case), 0.60 day (Case l), 0.50 day (Case 2) and Q.40 day (Case 3). This difference in fluid residence time is due to the changes in annular volume. The effluent fluid temperature history plot is given in Figure 17. The insignificant difference in the fluid returns temperature for different casing lengths could be attributed to the small difference in the overall heat transfer coefficients between the cased and uncased portions of the well (see Appendix A).\n\nWe varied the tubing properties to see what effect they had on produced fluid temperature. The tubing insulation was changed to a perfect insulator in one study, the tubing size was increased in another. Temperature histories summarizing these studies are given in Figure 18. The effluent fluid temperature at the 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate increased from 83.8\"C (182°F) to 86°C (187°F) and to 86.6\"C (1 88°F) by making the insulation thermal conductivity ten times lower and zero, respectively. Comparing PSS fluid returns temperature of cases with increased insulation to the base case with realistic insulation value (0.07 W/m\"C [0.04045 BTU/ft.h\"F]; h a t s 1986), the ideal case of perfect insulation indicates that tubing insulation beyond a realistic value did not have a significant effect for a circulation rate of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s). As the circulation rate increases the fluid residence time in the tubing decreases, and consequently, the effect of higher tubing insulation also decreases. The fluid residence time in the 76.2 mm (3.0 in.) internal diameter tubing at 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate was 0.047 day. Except for the initial short transient period, the produced fluid temperature history for the tubing diameter of 127 mm (5.0 in.) was not significantly different from the base case with tubing diameter of 88.9 mm (3.5 in.). Thus, the tubing properties beyond realistic values proved to be of secondary importance to energy extraction efficiency. Kohl, Brenni, and Eugster (2002) investigated the effect of insulation thermal conductivity. Their study concluded that the insulation thermal conductivity had an effect on the effluent fluid temperature. They used different wellbore configuration and circulation rates in their study. For insulation, they used two concentric tubes with the inner tube fully fitted into the outer one and insulation maintained by a vacuum pump with the individual long double walled tubes connected by 0.1 m (3.94 in.) long metallic sleeves. Their study acknowledges that the thermal role of the sleeves remains unclear; our model provides a uniform insulation layer on the outer surface of tubing. Their study used a 22.4 gpm (1.41 kg/s) circulation rate; our study used a 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate. The differences in the insulation effects could be attributed to the different wellbore configuration (including insulation) and circulation rates. The insulation thermal conductivity for our wellbore configuration and circulation rate, had a second order effect beyond realistic insulation. 350 1 r 127 mm Tubing dia Perfect Insulation O ! 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 Time (days) 046A50008-71-15 Figure 18. Effluent fluid temperature history plot for different tubing properties (insulation thermal conductivity and tubing diameter) at a circulation rate of 100 gpm illustrating the insignificant effect of tubing properties.\n\nWe analyzed the volumetric heat capacity of the working fluid. We used water as our original working fluid, which has a volumetric heat capacity (pCp) of approximately 4,186 kJ/m30C (62.37 BTU/ft3\"F) at standard conditions. We analyzed the effect of different working fluids by independently varying fluid density and specific heat capacity. Transport properties of the fluid such as viscosity were ignore1 in this study since friction drop, flow regime, etc., were also ignored, and heat conduction in the advecting fluid is negligible. Values for working fluid density and specific heat are given in Table 5.\n\nThe result of effluent fluid temperature history from this sensitivity study is plotted in Figure 19. The circulation rate was maintained at 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s). Temperatures at PSS range from 113.2\"C (235.76\"F) in the case of low volumetric heat capacity (pCp halved) to 34°C (93°F) for Cases B and D (pCp increased tenfold). The similarity in temperature histones for cases B and D demonstrates that volumetric heat capacity-pCp, not p or Cp-independently governs energy extraction.\n\n-----._ ---_____ ---.----------.>-*--.-. Since working fluid properties affect ideal work, which is based on enthalpy and entropy specific to the working fluid, it was not calculated. Instead, thermal energy production rates are plotted in Figure 20. Figures 19 and 20 show an interesting paradox-fluids with larger volumetric heat capacity have lower temperatures but larger thermal energy density. This is summarized in Figure 21, which illustrates a fundamental problem in identifying the optimum working fluid. Work extraction potential is measured against a rejection temperature; there is a minimum fluid temperature for which energy can be extracted. Given the PSS temperature results in this study, it appears that water is nearly the ideal working fluid.\n\nRecognizing the WBHX concept is not tied to any particular geologic region, we also conducted sensitivity studies on regional parameters. We first studied sensitivity to basal heat flux, which was varied between 0.1 W/m' (0.03 17 BTU/ft'.h) to 0.5 W/m' (0.1585 BTU/ft2.h). In all cases, bottomhole temperature was maintained at 350°C (662\"F), so varying the heat flux was equivalent to expanding or contracting the well depth. The well depths varied from 5,593 m (18,350. ft) for a heat flux of 0.1 W/m' (0.0317 BTU/ft'.h), to 2,796.5 m (9,175. ft) for 0.2 W/m' (0.0634 BTU/ft2.h), and to 1,119 m (3,671. ft) for 0.5 W/m2 (0.1585 BTU/ft'.h), which were obtained using Fourier's law of heat conduction. Since the surface and bottomhole temperatures were fixed, we calculated initial temperature gradients in the formation to be O.O578\"C/m (O.0317loF/ft), 0.1 156\"C/m (O.O6342\"F/ft), and 0.289\"C/m (0.15856\"F/ft) for a basal heat flux of 0.1 W/m'(0.0317 BTU/ft'.h), 0.2 W/m'(0.0634 BTU/ft'.h), and 0.5 W/m'(0.1585 BTU/ft'.h) respectively.\n\nThe temperature histories and ideal work extraction rate histories for the three cases of heat flux are given in Figures 22 and 23, respectively. At PSS, the effluent fluid temperatures were 83.7\"C (1 83°F) for a heat flux of 0.1 W/m2(0.0317 BTU/ft'.h), 58.5\"C (137.3\"F) for 0.2 W/m'(0.0634 BTU/ft'.h), and 40.5\"C (105°F) for 0.5 W/m' (0.1585 BTU/ft'.h). Similarly, the PSS ideal work extraction rates for 0.1 W/m' (0.0317 BTU/ft'.h), 0.2 W/m2 (0.0634 BTU/ft'.h), and 0.5 W/m' (0.1585 BTU/ft'.h) were 129 kW (440.2e+3 BTUh), 43 kW (146.7e+3 BTUh), and 9.3 kW (31.733e+3 BTUh), respectively. The plot illustrates that, for a fixed maximum downhole temperature, deeper wells yield higher produced fluid temperatures. The ideal work extraction rate follows the same trend-under conditions of fixed bottomhole temperature, the lower heat flux, and hence deeper wells, are favorable for energy extraction. However, economic considerations (ignored in this study) would argue the reverse. -5,593.1 m (0.1 W/m2) --2,796.5 m (0.2 W/m2) I a l E 100-.-_ o r 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Time (days) 04-GA5000872-04 Figure 23. Ideal work extraction rate as a function of basal heat flux. The lowest basal heat flux case has the highest ideal work extraction rate for fixed bottomhole temperature.\n\nThe fluid residence times and contact surface areas are a function of the wellbore depth. The larger residence time of the circulating fluid and heat transfer area in the deeper well lead to more energy transfer and higher fluid temperature at PSS. The wellbore depth has a greater influence compared to the formation thermal gradient on the energy extraction. The calculation of average formation heat transfer in Appendix C proves mathematically, using a simplified model, that the wellbore depth had a primary effect on the heat extraction and the geothermal gradient had a secondary effect.\n\nWe selected seven different formation types and studied the effects of varying formation thermal properties on the heat extraction process. The thermal properties of the different formations are given in Table 6. For convenience, these properties were taken from a compilation of sedimentary and evaporite formation types (hats 1986); however, the range of properties is representative of essentially all rock types. Other than formation thermal properties, all other variables are as in the base case. Temperature histories for the various cases are given in Figure 24. As can be seen, the formation with the largest thermal conductivity and thermal volumetric heat capacity gives the highest fluid temperature. Shale with a high thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity led to the highest fluid return temperature while Bandera sandstone with low thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity led to the lowest fluid return temperature. At PSS, the Bandera sandstone formation case resulted in an effluent fluid temperature of 34°C (93\"F), and the shale formation case resulted in an effluent fluid temperature of 86°C (1 87°F).\n\nThe reason for dependence on both thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity is because heat transfer from a conductive regime into an advecting regime is directly proportional to thermal conductivity and inversely proportional to the square root of thermal diffusivity (Carslaw and Jaeger 1959). In fact, if the formations are ranked according to decreasing WK', where K is the thermal diffusivity and K is thermal conductivity, PSS temperature histories (and work rates) correlate to that order. Figure 25\n\nIn order to study the effects of natural convection on the effluent fluid temperature and ideal work extraction rate, we modeled and compared a case with formation fluid convection to a case having no convection. The convection case was assigned a permeability of 9.869e-14 m2 (100 mD) and a porosity of 10%. The top 762 m (2,500 ft) is conductive cap rock zone, the remainder is convective zone A steadystate aquifer boundary condition at the bottom allowed for fluid convection into the reservoir and another steady-state aquifer boundary condition at the edge from 610 m (2,000 ft) to 792.5 m (2,600 ft) allowed for fluid to flow out, thereby creating a natural convection cell. Figure 26 gives the formation temperature profiles for the convection case and the base case with no convection. Figure 27 plots the interstitial velocity profile at the 13 m (43 ft) radius away from the wellbore. The plot shows that the vertical interstitial velocity averages about 0.3 &day (1 fdday) upwards in the convection zone. Figure 28 shows the fluid return temperature history for the case with convection and without convection at circulation rates of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) and a wellbore depth of 5,593.1 m (18,350 ft).

The point of the example is that, even in the presence of large natural convection cells, energy extraction from a wellbore is not technically feasible (270 kW (92 1.3e+3 BTU/h) at 5 years production). With this degree of natural convection, the obvious solution would be to perforate the well and produce the formation fluidnot a WBHX design.\n\nWe used the results of the sensitivity study (see Table 7) to construct the most optimistic set of parameters for WBHX (see Table 8). Results of the best case simulation are given in Figures 30 and 3 1. At the onset of PSS, the fluid temperature is approximately 98°C (208.4\"F) and the ideal work extraction rate is 198 kW (675.6e+3 BTUh). We believe these results to be optimistic for several reasons, which include a 350°C (662°F) bottomhole temperature, and especially, an ideal conversion of thermal energy to electric power. Our intent was to identify the most optimistic set of formation and operational properties\n\nEffluent Temperature Value (\"C) -84.0 to estimate the ability to generate power using the WBHX concept.

The first case involved the use of a wellbore heat exchanger in a hypothetical reservoir with a body of magma at shallow depth. The second case had a wellbore heat exchanger installed under conditions similar to Northwest Geysers. We applied the optimal parameters determined from each study to our wellbore heat exchangers.\n\nIn the near surface magma study, the source heat flux at the base was assigned a value of 1 .34 W/m' (0.425 BTU/ft'/hr). The pressure at the tubing top in this case was 68 atm (1,000 psia) to maintain single phase conditions in the wellbore. The fluid enthalpy and entropy are functions of pressure and temperature; hence, the ideal work extraction rate takes into account the pressure of the effluent fluid. Since the logging tools and well materials cannot withstand extremely high temperatures, the bottomhole temperature was constrained at 350°C (662°F). Based on the basal heat flux, the well depth was calculated to be 401 m (1,3 16 ft). The injection and ambient temperature was 40°C (104°F).\n\nThe circulation rate was 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) and the calculated fluid residence time in the annulus was 0.0242 day. Figure 32 plots the produced fluid temperature history. After 0.37 days, the produced fluid temperature drops to the circulation temperature of 40°C (104°F) for the 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) circulation rate. The ideal work extraction rate was 43 kW (146.7e+3 BTUh) at PSS as shown in Figure 33. Thus, the near surface magma led to a high geothermal gradient restricting the wellbore to shallow depths. The nominal flow rates with shallow wells resulted in extremely small fluid residence times, and rendered the wellbore heat exchanger unfeasible under such environments.\n\nThe Northwest Geysers are another potential site for a wellbore heat exchanger. Therefore, we conducted this case study to determine the viability of a wellbore heat exchanger in a vapor-dominated environment. The Geysers have two types of reservoirs, a normal vapor-dominated reservoir (NVDR) and a high-temperature reservoir (HTR). The NVDR studied was located at a formation depth of 30.48 m (100 ft) and had a thickness of 1,828.8 m (6,000 ft). The HTR studied was below the NVDR and had a thickness of 609.6 m (2,000 ft). The NVDR temperature varied from 240°C (464°F) at the top to 250°C (482°F) at the bottom, and the HTR temperature varied from 250°C (482°F) to 350°C (662°F). The formation had a homogenous permeability of 4.935e-14 m' (50 mD) and a porosity of 0.02. The model did not allow the formation fluids to flow into the wellbore, since the wellbore heat exchanger is designed to extract heat through thermal conduction only. The well radial geometry of the base case was adopted with a circulation rate of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s). The pressure at the tubing top was maintained at 34.1 atm (501 psia) to maintain single-phase conditions in the wellbore. The formation consisted of a vapor phase, wherein the liquid water was injected into the annulus and thermal energy was extracted from the formation in the vicinity of the wellbore. This resulted in condensation of the vapor phase in the formation, which then propagated laterally into the formation with time. The heat losses from the formation depth of 30.48 m (100 ft) to the surface were ignored, and the ideal energy was calculated with respect to the ambient conditions of 26.7\"C (80°F) and 1.0 atm (14.7 psi). Figure 34 shows the produced fluid temperature history and Figure 35 is a plot of the ideal work rate history. The simulation was conducted for 245 days, at which time the PSS was attained. The decline rate for effluent temperature beyond 150 days was 0.012\"C/day (0.022\"F/day). As shown in the plots, the fluid return temperature at 245 days was 76.0\"C (168.8\"F), and the ideal work extraction rate history is 118.5 kW (404.4e+3 BTU/h). These output values are below the performance of the base case wellbore heat exchanger and hence not an attractive option. 400 1 o ! 0 50 100 150 200 250 3 0 Time (days) 04-GA50008-72-16 Figure 35.

The second law of thermodynamics allows one to quantify the limit placed on the conversion of heat to work through the definition of available energy. Available energy is that portion of energy that could be converted into work by ideal processes, which bring the energy source to a dead state-a state in equilibrium with the earth and its atmosphere. This available energy or ideal work rate represents the maximum power that an energy conversion system could produce when using an energy source (geothermal) to generate electricity. For power conversion in a turbogenerator unit, a reasonably highpressure vapor phase must be created from the produced liquid fluid by either flashing it to a lower pressure or by exchanging heat to another secondary fluid vaporizing at a lower temperature. Using the best case scenario discussed in the previous section, we reviewed the following different ways of analyzing the electric power generation capability of a wellbore heat exchanger: 0 Abe et al. (1999) made several important observations about the thermal energy production and its conversion to electrical energy in hot dry-rock systems. According to their study, a resource that can return water to the surface at temperatures in the range of 150°C (302°F) or higher, appear to be a minimum requirement for electrical power production using current technologies, and temperatures around 80-90°C (176194°F) could be practical for direct use applications. They also suggested that even a small commercial geothermal power plant, such as a 5 M W (1.70607e+7 BTU/h) plant producing electricity from water at 150°C (302\"F), would require flow rates on the order of 2,378 gprn (137.5 kg/s). These requirements on the produced fluid temperatures would apply to the wellbore heat exchanger system as well. At the onset of PSS for the best case WBHX, fluid temperature is approximately 98°C (208.4\"F) with a circulation rate of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s). This output is far below the recommended criteria for temperatures and circulation rates (150°C [302\"F] at 2,378 gpm r137.5 kg/s]) set by Abe et al. Based on data of existing low-temperature power generating facilities, we estimated the expected power generation from best case WBHX. What information is available on low-temperature generating facilities is summarized in Table 9 (taken from http://www.geothennie.de/egec-peothernet/prof/small geothermal power.htm). The conversion rate (q) in Table 9 is defined as fluid circulation rate (9) required per unit of power (W) or:\n\nv=-4 W (9) Table 9.

(at 104°C [219\"F]) closest to our best case in producing temperature), we calculate our maximum expected power generation rate from WBHX as follows:\n\nThus, for what appears to be the optimum set of operating conditions, the WBHX can generate less that 50 kW (170.61e+3 BTUh) at the onset of PSS.\n\nFigure 36 obtained from Nichols (1986), plots the potential net power output that could be expected at a given flow rate and fluid temperature. In the best case WBHX, with a fluid temperature of 98°C (208°F) and 100 gpm (6.\n\n3 kg/s) circulation rate at the onset of PSS, the potential net power output is approximately 50 kWe (170.6e+3 BTUh). At 5 years, the fluid temperature falls to 86°C (1 87°F). At this temperature the minimum expected flow rate to estimate the potential power output (64 kWe (21 8.4e+3 BTUh)) is 300 gpm (18.9 kg/s). Due to the declining fluid temperature, at a flow rate of 100 gpm (6.3 kg/s) the electrical power output keeps declining from 50 kWe (170.6e+3 BTUh) at 500 days until it becomes not viable to produce at later time. Thus the WBHX generates an estimated net power output less than 50 kWe (170.6e+3 BTUh) during PSS. Based on the above arguments, we were able to draw the following observations:\n\nA best case WBHX design produces both circulation rates and fluid temperatures far below those used in low-temperature power plants.\n\nEven assuming an ideal energy conversion process, a WBHX produces less than 200 kW (682.4e+3 BTUh) of power at PSS. Using realistic conversion rates, it is likely the WBHX can generate less than 50 kW (170.6e+3 BTUh) at PSS, and that rate declines with time. Based on existing technology, it is suggested that the wellbore heat exchanger is best suited for direct ,use applications. It is not economically viable for electric power generation.\n\nOur model assumed an equivalent Fourier's law of heat conduction at the solid-fluid interface in the place of Newton's law of cooling. The predominant heat transfer mechanisms are the thermal conduction from the formation towards the wellbore and fluid advection in the wellbore. Appendix A describes the heat transfer coefficients in the wellbore.\n\nTwo phase flow regimes in the wellbore were not incorporated into the model. For this study, the maximum temperature of fluid was 350°C (662°F). The saturation pressure of water at 350°C (662°F) is 2,400 psia (16,547 Wa). The pressure and temperature of the fluid in the wellbore was such that only single phase conditions were possible; hence, the two phase correlations were not required. Also, flashing is not recommended in wellbore heat exchangers because it reduces available energy by increasing entropy.\n\nThe frictional pressure losses were not included in the model. The goal of this study is to evaluate the maximum possible ideal work extraction rate, and therefore, the parasitic loads were not even considered. Hence, the frictional pressure drop losses, which would affect the input power requirements and parasitic load, are considered negligible in this study.\n\nWe developed a numerical model to investigate the potential for power generation using a wellbore as a heat exchanger and conducted a variety of sensitivity studies to obtain an understanding of variations in operational and regional properties and how they affect heat transfer. On the basis of these studies, we have drawn the following specific conclusions:\n\nThere is a tradeoff between circulation and energy extraction rates, which implies that an intermediate optimum circulation rate exists that maximizes heat transfer to the circulating fluid.\n\nFor fixed circulation rates, any increases in residence time of the fluid and contact surface area in the wellbore enhances energy extraction; this includes wellbore diameter and/or depth.\n\nFor fixed bottomhole temperature, lower basal heat flux is better because it leads to deeper wells and longer residence times.\n\nMinimum tubing insulation is required, but enhancements to either insulation or changes in diameter affect the process insignificantly at optimum circulation rates.\n\nEnergy extraction is very sensitive to formation thermal properties. Larger thermal conductivities and larger thermal diffusivities lead to improved energy extraction.\n\nTradeoffs exist between the heat capacity of the working fluid and the extraction temperature. Water appears to have optimal or near optimal properties to provide reasonable energy density at acceptable temperatures.\n\nA best case WBHX design uses circulation rates far below any low-temperature power plants, and also produces fluid temperatures below plant operations. Even assuming ideal conversion of the thermal energy, a WBHX produces less than 200 kW (682.4e+3 BTUh) of power at PSS. Using realistic conversion rates, it is likely the WBHX can generate less than 50 kW (170.6e+3 BTUh) at PSS. and that rate declines with time.\n\nFigure 3 1 .\n\nF i p e 33 .\n\nFigure 34 .
