    "abstract": "In the companion paper\n(Holmquist et al. 1988)\n, we concluded that there is no agreement on either the correct branching order or differential rates of evolution among the higher primates, and we examined in depth why this uncertainty in the evolutionary understanding of our closest living relatives persists. Recently, Lake developed two novel methods, based on group properties of transition and transversion operators, that (a) permit, in principle, objective resolution of problems of the above type and (b) attach a statistical significance level to the conclusions drawn. In the present paper, we develop formulas for using these two methods in tandem and apply them to study transversion differences in (1) nuclear DNA for a 7-kb segment of the VT-globin locus and a 3-kb intergenic region between the VP-and &globin loci and (2) mitochondrial DNA for the 896-bp fragment of Brown et al. Although each of these nucleotide sequence regions has its characteristic tempo and mode of evolution, the nuclear and mitochondrial data together, comprising a total of 10,939 base positions, support a Homo/Pun clade at the 97% confidence level. If we calibrate the divergence point for humans and chimpanzees at 5 Myr, consideration of the transversion branch lengths for the combined nuclear data indicates that the gorilla lineage branched off 600,000-900,000 years prior to that, although the 26 sampling errors do not preclude either a temporal trifurcation for the three species or a considerably more ancient branch point for the gorilla. To resolve the length of this central branch to a relative accuracy of 25% and 30% will require a factor of 16 and nine times more data, respectively-i.e., in excess of 100,000 homologous nucleotides for each of the four primates. For the nuclear genes, heterogeneity in evolutionary rates between different parts of the genome is mostly restricted to the human lineage for these two segments. The lineage leading to chimpanzees has evolved 0.4 (3-kb fragment) to 3.5 (7-kb segment) times as rapidly as the lineage leading to humans, and that leading to the gorilla has evolved approximately one-fifth to one-half as rapidly as that leading to chimpanzees. Thus, even local molecular clocks can \"tick\" badly. As significant is the fact that virtually contiguous parts of the genome tick at markedly different rates. For the combined nuclear genes-a 10,046-bp data set-the distance along the interior branch separating the sequence ancestral to Homo/Pan from the node leading to Gorilla and Pongo is 14 and 17 times smaller, respectively, than the distance separating the human from the chimpanzee or the gorilla from the orangutan. On the basis of the present study it appears that the most pressing scientific problem is no longer",
    "full_text": "In the companion paper (Holmquist et al. 1988), we culled 2 1 of those properties of current models for phylogenetic inference that encourage an incorrect-or prevent an unambiguous-interpretation with regard to branching order and branch lengths. Noting that Lake's formulation (1987a, 19873) of evolutionary parsimony, phylogenetic invariants, and operator metrics is free of the more serious defects of the above models, in the present paper we extend this formulation by deriving general formulas that permit the simultaneous study of the topology and branch lengths of an unrooted four-taxon tree and apply them to the analysis of both the 7. I-kbp region of the vrlglobin gene (Miyamoto et al. 1987) and the nonoverlapping 3. I-kbp intergenic region (Maeda et al. 1988) between the @-globin gene (this is identical to the vq-globin gene of Goodman et al. 1984) and the S-globin gene for orthologous (Goodman et al. 1984;Koop et al. 1986a, 19863) sequences from Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus. Our examination of the total of 10,046 ungapped homologous sites is the most exhaustive molecular analysis of a nuclear data set in higher primates to date. We then expand the generality of this study by reexamining, using Lake's new methods, the rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNA fragment studied by Brown et al. (1982). Some essential differences between these methods and those of maximum parsimony are explored by a careful examination of the very different manner in which each interprets sites exhibiting homoplasy or multiple variants.\n\nFor estimating the branching order and branch lengths among the four primates in this study, we used the 7,099-bp region of the vtl-globin gene regions, including upstream and downstream flanking sequences (Miyamoto et al. 1987). The latter two areas comprise -6 1% of the total sequence. To determine the effect of additional data on our estimates, we also examined the 3,266-bp intergenic region between the vqglobin and the 6-globin genes (Maeda et al. 1988). To consider a sequence representative of very rapidly evolving DNA, we looked at the 896-bp mitochondrial fragment of Brown et al. (1982). If there was a gap at any position for one or more of the four species, that position was excluded from the analysis. There were 198 such positions for the first study, 12 1 for the second, and one for the third.\n\nFor estimation of the branching order, we used Lake's (1987b) method of phylogenetic invariants. Although the method is simple, its understanding requires attention to detail; and for that detail we refer readers to Lake's original publication. We recapitulate here only those essentials necessary for the derivations and analyses in this paper.\n\nThroughout this paper, we align the nucleotide sequences in the order Homo-Pan-Gorilla-Pongo. At any position within a sequence, for four aligned taxa (with gapped positions excluded) there are exactly 256 possible experimental patterns, because for each of the four sequences each base position can be occupied by A, C, G, or T.\n\nTo simplify matters, Lake examines these only for the patterns of transition and transversion differences. This reduces the number of different patterns to just 36. For example, the pattern CCAA (C in Homo and Pan, A in Gorilla and Pongo) occurs at position 560 in Miyamoto et al. ( 1987), and Lake designates this pattern by the notation (1133), which he abbreviates by the symbol E. The patterns AACC, AATT, TTAA, GGTT, TTGG, GGCC, and CCGG would each also be represented by ( 1133) and abbreviated 8, because in all these cases the first two bases are the same and related to the last two bases by transversions. The patterns l? (13 13) and G ( 133 One of the practical problems confounding phylogenetic inferences is that patterns mimicking those expected for a historically incorrect topology can arise through various combinations of base substitutions occurring within the true topology. Prior to Lake's work, such patterns simply misled us and might justifiably be dubbed phylogenetically misinformative sites. Lake's insight was to see that, if we consider, in addition to 8, F, and G, just nine such other patterns, we can in fact sort out the historically correct branching order. These nine patterns are ( 1233), ( 1323), ( 1332); ( 1134), (13 14), ( 134 1); and ( 1234), ( 1324), ( 1342),' designated H, L, 0; j, N, s; and u, 9, ti by Lake. The first six of these correct for misleading base-difference patterns that arise from substitutions in terminal branches and that artifactually augment E, F, and G; the last three correct for the effect of transitions in terminal branches that artifactually diminish E, F, and G;. As an example, if historically species 2 and 4 share common ancestry, then the phylogenetically informative pattern will be F (13 13). Nonetheless, on those occasions when transversion differences occur along the branches leading to species 1 and 2 the pattern E (33 11 = 1133) will be present and strict parsimony would incorrectly interpret this as evidence that historically it was species 1 and 2-rather than 2 and 4-that shared common ancestry. In such a case, however, whenever pattern (3311) is present, pattern (3411) = (1233)-i.e., pattern H-will also be present in approximately equal frequency, thus serving as a marker for the misleading contribution to E. By subtracting H from E, we do not overcount the number of nucleotide positions that truly support grouping species 1 and 2 together. By the same token, if species 1 and 2 do belong together historically, the pattern that indicates this-namely E (1133)-will, when transitions take place in the branches leading to species 2 and 4, be converted to the pattern u (1234), the pattern fi serving as a marker for this type of event. The change TTGG to TCGA is one illustration of this type event. Adding u to E thus avoids undercounting the number of events that support the true branching 1. The numbers in the notation have the following meanings. A \" 1\" means the base in that sequence is the same as the base at that position in the first sequence (Homo in this case). A \"2\" means the base in that sequence is related to the base in the first sequence by a transition difference. A \"3\" means the base in that sequence is related to the base in the first sequence by a transversion difference. If two sequences have transversions differences relative to the first sequence and if the second transversion is different from the first transversion, the second transversion difference is represented by a \"4.\" For example, if the pattern at a site is ACGT, this would be denoted ( 1324), abbreviated ? by Lake. See table 1 of Lake (19873) for a full listing of the 36 possible patterns. To determine branching order, only the 12 patterns discussed in this section are needed, but all 36 are necessary to determine the branch lengths accurately (see following section). It is therefore convenient to do the tabulation of all 36 at the same time.\n\norder. This reasoning is the basis for the construction of the phylogenetic invariants discussed in the following paragraph. Further discussion of these nine patterns in the context of the actual data can be found in the Results section.\n\nLake then defines the three quantities X, Y, and 2: X = E + u -H -J; Y = F + v -L -N; and 2 = G + w -Q -S. Letters without a circumflex (^) indicate the total number of sites in the sequence set with that particular pattern of base differences. Lake calls the expectation values of these three quantities phylogenetic invariants, and each is associated with one and only one branching order, which, for our application, is X with [Homo-Pan; Gorilla-Pongo], Y with [Homo-Gorilla; Pan-Pongo], and Z with [Pan-Gorilla; Homo-Pongo]. Lake proves that, within the assumptions of his model, the two invariants associated with the incorrect branching order are zero and that the invariant associated with the historically correct branching order, for bifurcating unrooted trees, is greater than zero. (For bifurcating trees with no transversion differences in the central branch, the invariant associated with the correct topology could also be zero.) In practice, because sequences are of finite length, only the sampling estimates of X, Y, and Z are available. The problem then becomes one of determining the statistical significance level at which each of these quantities does or does not differ from zero. Lake ( 1987b) uses the x2 statistic for this purpose. In the present paper, for reasons detailed in footnote a to table 3, we use the binomial statistic.\n\nWe assume that the historically correct branching order has been estimated as in the preceding section. Given this branching order, there are exactly four unrooted three-taxon trees, each with three limbs branching off from the central interior node, the limbs being designated A, B, and C (the branches leading to Homo, Pan, and Gorilla, for example). We use the method of operator metrics (Lake 1987a) for determining the branch lengths of each of these four trees. In this method, the branch length is defined as the number of base differences of the transversion type between two adjacent nodes. The situation with only three aligned sequences is considerably simpler than that with four. There are only a total of 64 experimental patterns possible, and, if one classifies these according to the patterns of transition-and transversiontype differences, only 10 different patterns remain. As shown in table 1 (Lake 1987a) and figure 2 (Lake 1987a), these 10 are 6 (11 I), a (122), b (121), c (112), A (133), B (131), C (113), fi (123), ? (132), and w (134), exemplified by (AAA), (AGG), (AGA), (AAG), (ACC), (ACA), (AAC), (AGC), (ACG), and (ACT), respectively. Again the pattern to which the three aligned bases at each position in the sequence are assigned is determined solely by the type of transition and transversion differences in the pattern. Thus (AGC), (CTG), and (GAC), among five others, are all assigned to the pattern u.\n\nAll 10 components are needed to calculate the three transversion branch lengths of the three-taxon tree, and the very simple formulas needed are in the note to table 5. Parsimony and distance-matrix methods, applied to transversion differences, use only six (A, B, C, fi, ?, and ti) of these components (Lake 1987a). By also using the four other components (8, a, 6, and e), Lake is able to isolate the base differences at each position in the sequence set to the historically correct branch responsible for them. Because each lineage will be represented in exactly two of the four three-taxon trees, there will be two estimates of the length of each branch. This serves as a check on both calculational errors and the consistency of the method, as well as on the degree to which the isolation of differences to a particular branch has in fact succeeded: the\n\nTable 1 Relationships between Three-Taxon and Four-Taxon Spectral Components wxy-\" w-y za w?LZa -xyza Q(lll)b g(l22) . b(121) c(112) .

In the present paper, to distinguish between the two cases we underline the letters for spectral components of three-taxon trees and do not underline those for the four-taxon trees.\n\nbranch lengths for any two lineages should not change, except within the statistical variation expected from the finite length of the sequence, even if the third (outgroup) species is changed.\n\nWhat is remarkable about Lake's method is that the branch lengths are determined solely by observations on the experimental pattern of base substitution in the sequences. No ancestral sequences are necessary.\n\nWith regard to notation, Lake used some of the same letters to designate biologically distinct patterns in the three-and four-taxon tabulations. For example, the two different patterns (GCT) and (CGAT) are ( 134) and ( 1342) in number notation. Lake tried to be as consistent as possible and designated both of these by the same letter w. In the following section, it is necessary to be absolutely clear about the meanings of the different patterns. Accordingly, we have removed the ambiguity by underscoring all three-taxon patterns. Thus (GCT) becomes $; (CGAT) remains w.\n\nHaving tabulated the number of sites for each of the 36 four-taxon patterns, we now derive the formulas for combining these to give the 10 valid three-taxon patterns. This makes it unnecessary to retabulate everything four times over and permits the two methods (Lake 1987a, 1987b) to be used in tandem for the simultaneous estimation of both branch order and branch length for four taxa. The formulas depend on the three sequences chosen as the terminal taxonomic units when classifying the threetaxon patterns. Table 1 shows the appropriate correlations for each of the four ways in which three taxa can be chosen from four aligned sequences. We derive, for illustration, the formula in the fifth row for the choice w_ yz of table 1: (1)\n\nIn the three-taxon choice w_yz, only sequences w, y, and z are being considered. Thus, if A, E, A, and i are, respectively, (GTTT), (AACC), (CTAA), and (GCTT), then removing the second sequence leaves (GTT), (ACC), (CAA), and (GTT), respectively. All are of the pattern (133), i.e., A. Proceeding through all 36 four-taxon patterns, we find that A, E, I!& and i are the only ones that can contribute to the threetaxon pattern A = (133). The other formulas are derived in an identical manner. It should be noted that the 10 three-taxon patterns and the 36 four-taxon patterns sum to the same value, the total number of base sites examined. Also, each four-taxon pattern contributes to one-and only one -three-taxon pattern. These facts serve as useful checks on tabulation and computational errors.\n\nA correctly calculated branch length between two nodes has the property that it does not depend on the number of taxa in the tree. The branch lengths, as calculated by the above method, from each terminal node to the central node for the three-taxon topologies must be equal in value to the corresponding branch lengths in the fourtaxon topology. Thus the lengths of all exterior branches of the unrooted four-taxon tree will be known from this procedure.\n\nThe procedure leaves undetermined the length of the central branch between the two interior nodes of the four-taxon unrooted tree. As seen earlier, this particular branch is the critical one with regard to determining the correct branching order. An accurate estimate of its length is necessary to answer the question whether, in the present study, humans and chimpanzees branched off simultaneously with the gorilla (a branch length not statistically different from zero, i.e., a trifurcation) or at some later time nearer the present. The length of this central branch can be found by a straightforward extension of the biological reasoning leading to the formulas for the three-taxon branch lengths. For the A branch of a three-taxon tree, Lake (1987a) calculates the length LA as the product of the total number of sites and the ratio SA/\n\nThe pattern A (133) corresponds to a transversion difference having occurred in the A branch [( 3 11) = ( 133)]. This pattern could be mimicked, however, by two transversions (one in each branch) occurring in the B and C branches. This would make the number of transversions along the A branch appear larger than it in fact was. In his model Lake assumes that the two transversion outcomes are equally likely, so that, on the average, the pattern (ACC) arising by this process would occur approximately as often as the pattern (ACT). The latter is in number notation ( 134), i.e., &. The term --v~ in equation ( 2) thus compensates for the misleading information contributed by the transversion substitutions that occur in the non-A branches. The corresponding term for the central branch in the four-taxon tree corresponding to the X invariant is simply the phylogenetic invariant itself, &=X=E+u-H-J, (4) discussd in the section on determining the branching order.2\n\nThe term RA, defined in equation ( 3), also has a simple interpretation. The terms Q (111) and a (122) represent, respectively, the number of sites in the sequence at which all sequences are identical and the number of sites in which a transition difference was introduced into branch A [(2 11) = ( 122)]. Again the negative terms represent the confounding contribution from all other (non-A) branches that make Q + a appear larger than it would be had all transitions occurred along the A branch alone.\n\nFor a four-taxon tree, the patterns that contribute transition differences to the central branch are just 6, f, and g, and the confounding transition differences on the terminal branches give rise to the patterns a, 6, e, and d, so that\n\nand the length of the central branch is\n\nin which N is the total number of sites examined.\n\nTable 2 lists the patterns observed for the nuclear data sets of Miyamoto et al. (1987) and Maeda et al. (1988), together with that observed for the mitochondrial data set of Brown et al. (1982). As an aid in understanding this table quickly, note that a, b, 2, and d represent the presence of transition differences in the peripheral arms of the unrooted tree and that A, B, C, and fi represent the presence of transversion differences in those arms. Similarly, 2, i', and g and E, P, and G represent transition and transversion differences, respectively, in the central arm joining the two interior nodes in the unrooted trees. Because these higher primates are relatively closely related, and because of the relatively short sequence length, only 23 of the 36 possible patterns are actually observed.\n\nOn the basis of the data in table 3, we conclude that the 6,90 1 -bp region including the vq-globin gene and its flanking regions supports the grouping Homo with Pan and Gorilla with Pongo; but because of the small number of transversion differences between the ancestors of the two groups, for this sequence length the support is weak at the 25% level of significance. Lake (1987a) notes that parsimony should be used with caution whenever either of the two alternative trees is supported by significant 2. A comment is perhaps in order regarding Lake's (1987b)  Table 2 Observed Values of the Spectral Components for Four Taxa VALUE GIVEN BY COMPONENT Miyamoto et al. Maeda et al. Brown et al.

Patterns absent (value of zero) from all three data sets are not shown. A total of 6,901, 3,145 and 893b base positions is tabulated for each of the three data sets, respectively.\n\n' For the intergenic region studied by Maeda et al. (1988), there are two (nearly identical) alleles for the human sequence. These are designated R and T. The other three species have but one allele. Therefore, two four-taxon spectral component patterns result, depending on which human allele is aligned against the other three sequences. The two patterns are almost the same, so we have simply averaged the two values for each component. For example, for component 0 (1 1 1 1), with the R allele the value was 3,026. The value with the T allele was 3,024. Their average, 3,025 is given in the table. This also accounts for the two fractional values in this column.\n\nb There is a deletion in the orangutan sequence at position 560. We have also excluded position 40 and 569 because these two sites are polymorphic in humans. parsimony components (patterns I?, P, or G in table 2). Pattern g occurs three times. The parsimony components associated with the two alternative trees are l? and G. Pattern fi does not occur at all, and pattern e occurs but once in the 6,901 base positions examined. Lake also comments on his own method: \"The most reliable predictions are obtained when the central branch is as long as possible. This is because the central branch is the source of the signal. . . . The second factor is that low substitution rates in the peripheral branches of a tree produce a low background term and provide the best conditions for detecting a weak signal.\" These background terms for invariants A', Y, and 2 in table 3 are, respectively, H and J, L and N, and Q and S. These are (see table 2) identically zero, except for S, which occurs once.

Under this hypothesis, Lake (19876) has shown that the expectation value of the sum of the first two (positive) terms of each invariant must numerically equal the expectation value of the sum of the last two (negative) terms, so that for incorrect topologies the expected value of the invariant associated with that topology must be zero. We are thus testing, for the X invariant, for example, the two-class hypothesis that the number of nucleotide positions contributing to E + u equals the number of nucleotide positions contributing to H + J. The appropriate probability for testing significance is therefore the two-tailed binomial probability P(n, r/z), where n = the total observed number (E + u + H + J) of nucleotide positions in the two classes. The x2 statistic proposed by Lake (19876, eq. 9) though adequate for large values of E + u + H + J, overestimates the significance of a nonzero invariant when the value of this sum is small. For example, for the \"E Tree,\" \" F Tree,\" and \"G Tree\" in fig. 3 of Lake's ( 19876) paper, the x2 significance levels are P < 0.02, P < 0.30, and P < 0.70, respectively. Exact calculation of the significance levels from the binomial probability P(n, l/z), where n = 6, 1, and 7 (from Lake ( 19873, fig. 3), respectively, give P < 0.032, P < 1 .OO, and P < 1 .OO as the probabilities for deviations of the invariants from zero as large as or larger than the deviations observed and reported in that figure . \nbX=E+~-H-J.

(This is the reason for the presence of these terms in the expressions for the phylogenetic invariants X, Y, and Z-see footnotes b-d to table 3). Transition-type differences do not appear to be causing any trouble in the present case, for patterns u, C, and \\ji do not occur at the 6,901 positions examined. If the data in this table are representative, a sequence twice as long would be necessary to definitively (3% level of significance) favor the Homo/Pan clade over the other two topologies.\n\nTable 4 Values of the Three-Taxon Spectral Components for Each of The Four Possible Three-Taxon Data Sets that Can be Constructed from the Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, and Orangutan Nucleotide Sequences in Miyamoto et al. 1987 wxy-w-yz WX-2 JYZ Q(111) . . . . . 6,742 6,640 6,639 6,615 2 (122) . . . . 28 28 29 39 b(121) . . . . . 40 48 40 48 c(112) . . . . . . 48 110 110 110 A (133) . . . . 7 9 6 23 Jj (131) . . . . . . 20 13 22 11 C(113) . . . . 13 52 54 52 g (123)\n\n. . . . . .

(1987), the experimental three-taxon patterns necessary for determining branch lengths are given in table 4 for the four possible sets of three sequences. At least eight of the 10 possible patterns are present for each of these four sets. The intermediate values of Ri and Si needed to calculate the branch lengths from the last formula in the note to table 5 are in the lower half of table 5. The branch lengths for the three branches of each of the four three-taxon data sets are given in the top half of that table. From these, the branch length along each species lineage is tabulated in the first numerical column of table 6.\n\nThe fact that in table 6 the variation in branch lengths is (within sampling error) independent of the outgroup is evidence that Lake's operator metrics do what they claim to do-i.e., isolate substitutions to the branch to which they historically belong. This variation is 2%-39% of the sampling error itself, being least for the branch leading to humans. The rate of accumulation of transversion-type differences in the human lineage is 28% of that in the chimpanzee lineage, and the rate of accumulation of these differences in the gorilla lineage is ~53% of that in the chimpanzee lineage. Approximately three substitutions separate the ancestor of humans and chimpanzees from the node joining gorillas and the orangutan. However, the sampling error of 23.75 means that this data set, despite its length of 7 kb, is still too short to permit us to exclude the possibility of (1) a temporal trifurcation for the Homo, Pan, and Gorilla lineages and/or (2) a period of evolutionary stasis between the time the gorilla lineage split off and that at which the chimpanzee and human lineages separated.\n\nTable 7 compares the branch lengths calculated by Lake's operator metric method (table 6), those calculated from pair-wise transversio?-difference distance-matrix values\n\nTable 5 Branch Lengths (Operator Metrics) Li, Expressed as Estimated Number of Transversion Differences between the Central Node and Exterior Sequences, for Each of the Four Three-Taxon Data Sets That Can Be Constructed from the Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, and Orangutan Nucleotide Sequences in Miyamoto et al. 1987 wxy-w-y2 WX-Z JYZ L, .......... 6.2 f 5.8 9.5 + 6.2 6.3 + 5.2 24.3 + 10.1 L2 .......... 20.5 f 9.2 12.6 + 7.9 23.1 + 9.8 10.6 + 7.3 LJ .......... 11.3 -+ 6.8 53.4 + 14.7 54.3 + 15.1 51.6 + 15.1 SI . s2 . s3 .

Table 7 establishes that the rate differences among lineages found in earlier studies by parsimony and difference-matrix methods are indeed real, because Lake's method of operator metrics is relatively free of the major criticisms that have been levied against the other two methods. For the gorilla lineage, the number of transversion differences estimated by operator metrics is 11.60, while that estimated by maximum parsimony is 14. This difference could be dismissed as sampling error (from table 6, k5.39). However, the fact that the operator metric and parsimony methods agree quite closely for the other lineages in table 7, despite sampling error, suggests methodological causes. These are discussed in the immediately following section.\n\nThe different values in table 7, for the gorilla lineage, reflect the manner in which Lake's evolutionary parsimony method differs from traditional parsimony methods in its treatment of sites that show either homoplasy or multiple variants. For this reason, we shall discuss this discrepancy in considerable detail. Parsimony selects the tree that requires the minimum number of substitutions and assigns to each branch the number of substitutions necessary to satisfy that requirement. Evolutionary parsimony selects the tree that requires the minimum number of substitutions consistent with evolution in all peripheral branches of the tree (Lake 1987b). The number of consistent substitutions along a particular branch may, depending on the evolutionary\n\nTable 6 Calculation of Branch Lengths, Expressed as Estimated Number of Transversion Differences, for the Unrooted Four-Taxon Tree VALUE GIVEN IN Miyamoto et Maeda et al. al. 1987 1987 Miyamoto + Maeda Brown et al. 1987 Human to human/ chimpanzee ancestor Chimpanzee to human/ chimpanzee ancestor Gorilla to human/ gorilla ancestor Orangutan to human/ gorilla ancestor Human/chimpanzee ancestor to human/ gorilla ancestor (from eq. 6) Average 6.19 (wxy-) 6.25 (wx_z) 6.22 + 3.90\" 20.52 (wxy_) 23.14 (wx_z) Average 21.83 + 6.72 12.62 (w-yz) 1.04 13.66 4.16 10.58 (xyz) ; 105 12.64 2.88 Average 11.60 f 5.39 1.04 k 2.85 13.15 + 5.65 3.52 f 3.73 53.35 (w_yz) 5 1.62 (-xyz) Average 52.48 + 10.56 3.25 + 3.75 0 3.23 Z!Z 3.73 4.67 + 5.38 10.73 16.97 2.51 11.99 18.43 -1.44 11.36 + 6.83 17.70 + 6.23 0.54 k 3.06 4.20 25.64 3.73 5.13 27.32 2 77 L 4.66 + 4.38 26.48 + 7.40 3.25 + 2.91 20.43 75.91 24.84 22.56 70.98 21.32 21.50 + 9.38 73.44 f 12.49 23.08 + 9.43 NOTE.-The source for each length is given in parentheses, with reference to the appropriate column in table 5.

One further important distinction between the models is that traditional parsimony models are deterministic. Lake's methods of evolutionary parsimony and operator metrics are very general stochastic models valid for a much larger set of evolutionary pathways.\n\nThe specific base sites causing the different values (for the gorilla lineage) shown in table 7 occur at positions 3477, 4234, 5 153, and 5487. The nucleotide quartets occupying these positions are, respectively, (AGCA), (TAGT), (ACCA), and (TCGC). Within each quartet, the bases are ordered by species-human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Position 5 153 (ACCA) is an example of homoplasy. The other three positions are examples of multiple nucleotide variants, the variant being species dependent, at those sites. In table 2, these sites are represented by patterns $ (123 l), S ( 134 l), G ( 133 l), and f ( 1232), respectively. Substitution of the numerical frequency (table 2) of these patterns into the expression for branch length given in the note to table 5 will analytically verify the results below. It is more instructive, however, to derive them from consideration of the biological processes involved, for in this manner\n\nTable 7 Comparison of Branch Lengths Calculated by Three Methods, for the Data of Miyamoto et al. 1987 METHOD Operator Maximum Distance Metrics Parsimony Matrix Human to human/chimpanzee ancestor ...........

There are several sets of nearby values that approximate the data well. We show just one of these.\n\nb For the gorilla lineage, the longer branch length obtained by maximum parsimony is attributable to the different ways by which that approach and Lake's (1987a, 19876) algorithm treat the nucleotide variation at positions 3,477,4,234, 5,153, and 5,487. At these positions, four transversions are placed by maximum parsimony. In contrast, zero or two (average one)\n\ntransversions are assigned to this branch, at these positions, according to the method of Lake (1987a, 1987b). These positions in the 7. I-kb sequences are unusual in that they are characterized either by homoplasy (site 5,153) or by multiple nucleotide variants (sites 3,477,4,234, and 5,487.) A detailed discussion is given in the text.\n\nthe essential differences between the method of maximum parsimony and the method of operator metrics become clear. The maximum parsimony A solution (the values shown in table 7) assigns one transversion difference for each of these positions to the gorilla lineage-a total of four. (The maximum parsimony B solution, which does not force as many substitutions into the terminal branches, places a total of three transversion differences along this branch. See Goodman [ 198 1 ] for a more detailed discussion of the A and B solutions.)\n\nIn Lake's method of operator metrics, the number of transversion differences along the gorilla lineage can be determined on the basis of either of two three-taxon DNA sequence sets: that from the human, gorilla, and orangutan or that from the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We analyze each of these in turn, because the biology represented in these two sets is both interesting and different for each.\n\nIf the DNA sequences from human, gorilla, and orangutan are used, together with Lake's (1987a) method of operator metrics, to estimate the number of transversion differences along the gorilla lineage, sites 3477, 4234, and 5 153 each contribute one transversion difference to the gorilla lineage. This can be seen in the three-taxon patterns obtained from the four-taxon patterns with the chimpanzee sequence removed: (ACA), (TGT), and (ACA), which in terms of the three-taxon spectral components in table 1 are patterns (13 l), (13 l), and (13 l), i.e., pattern & However, the operator metric method interprets the pattern at site 5487 (TCGC) quite differently than do traditional parsimony methods. With chimpanzee removed, this becomes (TGC) or the threetaxon spectral component ( 132), i.e., pattern ? in table 4. The operator metric method interprets this as evidence for either of two possible processes, without committing itself as to which of the two processes is actually responsible for the pattern. In the first process, there is a transversion in the gorilla lineage plus a transition in either the human or orangutan lineage: (CCC)-+(CGC) or (CAC)+(TGC) or (TAC), for example. In terms of the three-taxon spectral components this can be written as (11 l)+( 13 l)+( 132). In the second process, i is interpreted not as evidence for a transversion difference in the gorilla lineage but as a marker alerting us to possible transversion differences in both the human and orangutan lineages: (GGG)+(TGT) or (TGC) or, in three-taxon spectral component notation, ( 111)+(3 13) or ( 132), which is the same as ( 11 l)+( 13 1) or ( 132). Thus, for either process, not only does the marker (T-GC) pattern ( 132) at position 5487 not add to the count of transversion differences in the gorilla lineage but, for the second process, it implies (in a statistical sense) that there is another site with the pattern (T_GT) that we would have-but should not have-attributed to a transversion difference in the gorilla lineage. (This is the reason y is subtracted from B in the calculation of this branch length; see formulas in the note to table 5.) Because of the statistical nature of the evolutionary process, it is impossible to say which such position was erroneously counted, but, for the present data set, position 4234 (T_GT) is consistent with the hypothesized events and one possible such site. In any case, the necessity to reduce the transversion count by one difference offsets the positive contribution of position 4234 to this count, regardless of whether position 4234 was itself the erroneously counted position. Because of these considerations, in the operator metric method, of the four sites being discussed, only those at positions 3477 and 5 163 contribute net transversion differences to the gorilla branch-a total of two, rather than the four assigned by parsimony.\n\nThe number of transversion differences contributed to the gorilla lineage by the above four positions can also be estimated from the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan sequences. The resulting three-taxon patterns at positions 3477,4234,5 153, and 5487 are then (GCA), (AGT), (CCA), and (CCC). The corresponding spectral components are, respectively, 2 ( 132), 5 ( 123), c ( 113), and B ( 13 1). From this it can be seen that the biology represented in the DNA sequences for chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan at these positions is considerably more complex than those for the human, gorilla, and chimpanzee DNA sequences. For the latter three-taxon data set, only two patterns (B and 2) were present.\n\nFor the chimpanzee, gorilla, and chimpanzee DNA sequences at these four positions, the pattern $, this time at position 3477, is here a marker either for a transversion in the gorilla lineage plus a transition in the chimpanzee or orangutan sequence, or for a transversion in both the chimpanzee and orangutan lineages: (AAA)+(ATA) or (ACA)+(GTA) or (GCA), or (GCC)+(GCG) or (GCA). For neither of these two processes does the marker (GCA) pattern ( 132) at position 3477 add to the count of transversion differences in the gorilla lineage. The second process further implies that some (GCG) position, three-taxon spectral component pattern & has erroneously been included into the count of the total number of transversion differences in the gorilla lineage. This fact offsets the contribution of the B pattern at position 5487 to this count. Because of the probabilistic nature of the evolutionary process, it is impossible to say which such position was erroneously counted, but, for the present data set, position 576 (-CCC) is consistent with the hypothesized events. The three-taxon pattern at position 5 153, c (113), implies a transversion in the orangutan-not the gorilla-lineage.\n\nThe three-taxon pattern fi (123) at position 4234 is a marker either for a transversion in the orangutan lineage plus a transition in either the chimpanzee or gorilla lineages, or for a transversion in both the chimpanzee and gorilla lineages: (AAA)+(AAC) or (AAT)+(AGC) or (AGT), or (TTT)+(GGT)\n\nor (AGT). The marker (AGT) pattern ( 123) at position 4234 does not contribute to the count of transversion differences in the gorilla lineage for either process. For the second of these two processes, which in three-taxon notation is ( 11 l)+( 113) + ( 123), the marker at position 4234 implies that some (GGT) position, spectral component c (113), has erroneously been included in the count of transversion differences for the orangutan lineage. Position 1073 (_GGT), for example, is a possible such position. Nor would the latter position, or an equivalent one elsewhere, be counted as evidence for a transversion difference for the gorilla lineage (even though on the basis of the above events it is), because this position is, as just noted, recorded as the spectral component c ( 113), representing a transversion in the orangutan lineage. (This does not cause a miscount of the number of transversion differences in the orangutan lineage because spectral component Q is subtracted from C in calculating the length of the orangutan branch; see formulas in the note to table 5.) The net result is that, if the operator metric method is used, positions 3477, 4234, 5 153, and 5487 together contribute no net transversion differences whatsoever to the gorilla branch when the estimation is made on the basis of the DNA sequences of the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan.\n\nIn the operator metric method, there is no reason to prefer the human/gorilla/ orangutan set of sequences over the chimpanzee/gorilla/orangutan set. Thus, the four positions being discussed contribute an average of approximately one [l/2(2 + 0)] transversion difference to the gorilla branch, whereas maximum parsimony contributes a total of four. This can also be seen by tabulating, for both three-taxon sets, the siteby-site contributions. The homoplastic site at position 5 153 contributes an average (when both three-taxon sets are considered) of one-half a transversion difference to the gorilla lineage. The three multiple variant sites discussed exhibit varied behaviors. Site 3477 contributes, on average, no transversion differences to the gorilla lineage; nor does site 4234. Site 5487 contributes, on average, one-half a transversion difference to the gorilla lineage. The overall result is that all four sites contribute a net total of one transversion difference to the gorilla lineage, a result in agreement with the above calculation based on detailed consideration of the evolutionary processes involved at these sites.\n\nIn summary, whereas maximum parsimony assigns four transversion differences to the gorilla lineage, the operator metric method assigns just one. This difference of three transversion differences explains the discrepancy of values given in table 7 for the gorilla lineage.\n\nIt should be obvious from this section that even though Lake's methods ameliorate or eliminate many of the defects of maximum parsimony, they introduce assumptions of their own that must ultimately be validated against real and simulated data sets additional to those studied in the present paper and in Lake's papers (1987aLake's papers ( , 1987b)). Such simulations should be designed to explore the limits of validity of the new methods.\n\nIn understanding Lake's ( 1987a) method, it is of critical importance to recognize that under the assumptions of his model, the expressions he derives for the branch lengthsfully count (within sampling error) all transversion differences that occur, and this includes those arising from the processes considered in this section. In particular, for operator metrics, the transitions that may follow a transversion do not erase or distort the count of transversion differences in the branch length. This is of importance because there has been discussion in the literature as to the extent to which transitions prevent the accurate recovery of evolutionary information (Brown et al. 1982;Holmquist 1983;DeSalle et al. 1987;Jukes 1987).\n\nOur purpose in this section has not been to argue for or against the correctness of one or the other of the values given in table 7 for the gorilla lineage. The sampling error alone precludes deciding between them. Rather, our purpose has been to clarify, within the context of real DNA sequence data sets, the differences in biological rea-. soning that lie behind the operator metric and parsimony methods.\n\nTo measure the extent of genomic variation in evolutionary behavior, we also examined the 3,145 ungapped nucleotide positions of the intergenic region studied by Maeda et al. (1988). The nonzero four-taxon spectral components are given in table 2. The phylogenetic invariants X, Y, and 2 (table 3) are, respectively, 0, 1, and 0. These numbers are too small to draw any conclusions about branching order. The F pattern ( 13 13) occurs once, for both human alleles, at position 234 1. This could be taken as support for a human/gorilla clade, but certainly not at any meaningful level of statistical significance. Branch lengths are given in table 6.4 For this intergenic region, the human lineage appears to have evolved 2.4 times more rapidly than the chimpanzee lineage, although, because of the large sampling error associated with the smaller branch lengths, this number is again suggestive rather than precise. For the 7kb region of Miyamoto et al. ( 1987), the reverse was found, the human lineage having evolved 3.5 times more slowly than the chimpanzee lineage.\n\nTo determine the effect of an enlarged data base, we combined the data of Miyamoto et al. (1987) with that of Maeda et al. (1988) to obtain a sequence 10,046 kb in length.\n\nThe combined data set, labeled \"Miyamoto + Maeda\" in table 3, continues to favor the Homo/Pan clade, though still at a weak significance level.\n\nThe slowdown in evolutionary rate in the human lineage relative to the chimpanzee lineage is not as pronounced (table 6) in the combined data set as in Miyamoto et al. (1987), the rate in the former being 67% (rather than 28%) of that in the latter for the combined nuclear data. The rate in the gorilla lineage is -50% of that in the chimpanzee lineage for the combined data set, nearly the same as the 53% for the Miyamoto et al. data.\n\nThe persistence of the very short internal branch length in the combined data sets should alert us that it is not yet possible to disprove the possibility of a temporal trifurcation in these three lineages.\n\nThe preceding section suggests that the intergenic region studied by Maeda et al. (1988) may evolve at a different rate than the vq-globin gene region studied by Miyamoto et al. (1987). To test this idea and isolate the rate changes to specific lineages, we calculated the branch lengths expected on the basis of the data of Miyamoto et al. (1987), given the increased length of the combined data set, and compared (table 8) these values with the values actually observed. On the basis of table 8 it is clear that most of the heterogeneity in genomic evolutionary rates is restricted to the human lineage.\n\nTable 8 Effect of Heterogeneity of Rates of Evolution in Different Parts of the Nuclear Genome on Variability of Evolutionary Rates among Various Lineages  (1987) used as a reference point, the expected branch lengths of the combined data sets of Miyamoto et al. (1987) and Maeda et al. (1988) should be in the ratio of the total number of nucleotide sites examined. The expected values for the combined nuclear data set are then the product of the ratio 10,046/6,901 and the branch lengths in the first numerical column in table 6.\n\nb Taken from the third numerical column in table 6.\n\nMitochondrial DNA\n\nThe results (table 3) for the nuclear genes suggest that if we had twice as much data-i.e., -20 kb-we might be able to resolve the branching order in a statistically definitive manner. Because mitochondrial DNA evolves an order of magnitude more rapidly than nuclear DNA, we examined the 896-bp fragment studied by Brown et al. (1982), on the expectation that it would yield as much evolutionary information as a nuclear sequence 8,960 bp in length. The results are in tables 2, 3, and 6. On comparing the columns in table 2, it is apparent that the above expectation was realized for this data set. In table 3, the data favor the grouping of Homo with Pan-but, as with the nuclear data, only weakly, at the 25% level of significance. There is no support whatsoever in table 3 for grouping Homo with Gorilla or Pongo: observed spectral components @ (13 13) and e (133 1) are both zero.'\n\nIf we consider all the data available from this study, both nuclear and mitochondrial, the tentative grouping of Homo with Pan, suggested by the nuclear and mitochondrial data individually, becomes firm, as shown for the data set labeled \"All\" in table 3. If the topology favoring a human/chimpanzee clade were false, and if Lake's model is reasonably correct, there is only a 3% chance that we would observe an experimental value for the X invariant as large as X = 6. Accordingly, we accept this topology as the correct one. The phylogenetic invariants of the false topologies (Y and 2) are, within sampling error, experimentally zero (table 3), as predicted by Lake's model. On the basis of table 2, there are six positions (three nuclear plus three mitochondrial) in the combined data set, all of four-taxon pattern fi (1133), that support humans and chimpanzees as sister groups. The absence of patterns fi (1233) and j (1134) from both the nuclear and mitochondrial data would indicate that these six positions arose from synapomorphy (shared derived characters) rather than from homoplasy (parallel substitutions leading to convergence of structure). By contrast, there is but a single (nuclear) position, of pattern P ( 13 13), supporting a human/gorilla clade and but one, of pattern e (133 l), supporting a chimpanzee/gorilla clade; and 5. The mitochondrial DNA sequence data of Hixson and Brown (1986) do not meet this expectation of yielding a sufficient number of pattern differences to allow increased resolution of the branching order. These sequences provide one transversion (spectral component F) in favor of the Homo/Gorilla c!ade but no support for either the Homo/Pun (spectral component E) or Pan/Gorilla (spectral component G) clade. If included in our analyses, these sequences would not affect our overall results and conclusions.\n\nin both cases either the nuclear or mitochondrial data have positions, of patterns ti ( 13 14) and s ( 134 1 ), respectively, suggesting that these two positions may be of homoplastic origin.\n\nFor completeness the estimated branch lengths for the mitochondrial fragment of Brown et al. (1982) are shown in table 6. The large sampling errors associated with the short fragment length and the infrequent occurrence of transversion differences, for these mitochondrial data, do not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn about the relative rates of evolution in the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla lineages.\n\nIf we calibrate the divergence point for humans and chimpanzees at 5 Myr, consideration of the transversion branch lengths in table 6 permits us to assign a plausible time range for the branch point of the gorilla. On the basis of that table, the number of transversion differences between the human/chimpanzee ancestor and the human/gorilla ancestor is 3.23. This indicates that the gorilla lineage branched off 600,000-900,000 years prior to that, depending on whether the estimated transversion differences in the chimpanzee (26.48) or human (17.70) lineage is used as a base line. The 26 sampling errors do not preclude either a temporal trifurcation for the three species or a branch point for the gorilla as ancient as 8 Myr before the present (Mybp) (5 + 5[3.23 + 3.73]/[ 17. 70 -6.231). The observed genomic variability could be used to argue for a branch point for the gorilla as ancient as 20 Mybp. This is obtained from the 6 sampling limits of the Miyamoto et al. (1987) data set: 5 + 5(3.25 + 3.75)/ (6.22 -3.90).\n\nIn a nice demonstration of the power of his methods, Lake (1987a) found that, for the small-subunit rRNA sequences from mitochondria, the depth of branching of the fungal (Aspergillus nidulans) mitochondrion was no greater than that of the chloroplast, despite a fivefold-higher rate of substitution of the former relative to the latter; and he thereby substantiated Dickerson's (1980) and Ochman and Wilson's (1987) conclusions regarding the antiquity of this branching.\n\nIn the present study, we are concerned with recent, not ancient, branchings. Lake's methods here also effectively and accurately ferret out differences in rates among lineages. The data in tables 2-4 show that the base-difference patterns that cause difficulty in estimating branching order and branch lengths among ancient or rapidly evolving lineages can also occur in recently diverged lineages.\n\nFor the four primates studied here, the occurrence of confounding base-difference patterns is sufficiently infrequent that previous estimates of branch lengths are not compromised (table 7), although uncertainty as to the length of the central branch persists. This is consistent with the fact that parsimony is known to estimate branch lengths accurately when the divergence is no more than -1% base differences. For noncoding regions the divergence between human and orangutan, the largest divergence we study, is -3.3% (Koop et al. 1986a(Koop et al. , 1986b)). Approximately one-third (Koop et al. 1986a) of these differences are transversions, so the transversion divergence is -1.1%. Improved DNA repair mechanisms and lengthened generation time have both been cited (Goodman 1985;Britten 1986) as explanations for the lower rate of evolutionary change in hominoids. For noncoding regions, might this slower rate be due to a greater necessity for polite DNA (Zuckerlandl 1986)?\n\nFor the six pairwise differences HomoJPan, Homo/Gorilla, HomolPongo, Pan/Gorilla, PanfPongo, and Gorilla/Pongo, table1 of Miyamoto et al. ( 1987) gives values of 29,23,6 1, 36,77, and 66, respectively.If gapped positions are removed from this tabulation, these numbers become 28, 23, 61, 35, 77, and 66, respectively.\n\nHolmquist et al.\n\nTo save space the intermediate calculations corresponding to tables 4 and 5 are not shown for this and subsequent data sets.
