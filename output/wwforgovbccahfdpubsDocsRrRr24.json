    "abstract": "The Sicamous Creek research site is 7 km east-southeast of Sicamous (50° 50' n, 118° 55' w) at an elevation of 1530-1830 m, on a northwest-facing slope. The Engelmann spruce-subalpine fi r forest (ESSFwc2) is 22-27 m tall and canopy closure is about 50%. The climate at the site of the Sicamous Creek Silvicultural Systems Project is cool and moist with a mean annual air temperature of 1.2°c and an annual precipitation of 910 mm, about half of which occurs as snow.\nThe treatments monitored in this study were 0.1-, 1-, and 10-ha openings and mature forest. The base weather station was in a large opening with scattered regeneration adjacent to the experimental area. This study, in agreement with other studies, shows that most of the change in microclimate from forest to opening takes place within one tree height either side of the forest/opening edge. Openings of less than one tree height in diameter have a solar, wind, and thermal environment similar to that in the forest. Edge orientation has an effect, particularly for south-facing edges, where solar radiation can penetrate some distance into the forest for much of the day. Wind blowing directly into an edge penetrates farther into the forest than from other directions. The forest intercepts 20-30% of the precipitation. On sunny days, the forest air temperature near the ground is 2-4°c cooler than in the large openings. Near-surface daytime soil temperature is also 2-4°c cooler in the forest, while nearsurface nighttime soil temperatures are similar. iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Forest Renewal BC and the B.C.

The larger project is intended to address public and professional concerns about the effects of clearcut harvesting on high-elevation forests in the southern interior of British Columbia. The objectives of the study reported here were:\n\n• to provide weather data for the Sicamous Creek Silvicultural Systems Project. • to perform intensive, brief experiments to determine the variation in time and space of weather variables not amenable to long-term monitoring. • to obtain measurements of microclimate at various positions across a forest edge and within openings of various sizes. • to validate models of solar irradiance, wind fields, and microclimate across a forest edge and in openings.\n\nMuch of the current interest in forest edges is concerned with how far the inner edge extends into the forest (Figure 1). This is due primarily to the concern about maintaining biodiversity in a fragmented landscape, and providing a buffer against a changed microclimate (e.g., riparian buffer strips). However, there is an interest in the outer edge (in the clearing)  because this is where regeneration of the next stand occurs, and, as clearcuts become smaller, the proportion of landscape consisting of outer edge also increases.\n\nThe study started with the installation of the Sicamous Creek weather station in a large opening near the camp in July 1993. This was followed in 1996-1998 with the intensive measurements of edge microclimate. Energy balance and wind fl ow measurements were made in 1996 and 1997 in cooperation with researchers from the University of British Columbia. Wind gust measurements were made in 1997 and 1998 as part of a study on blowdown. The Sicamous Creek weather station continues to function, and data analysis, reporting, and extension activities are continuing.\n\nMicroclimate below forest canopies and in forest openings has been studied extensively for decades (fao 1962;Reifsnyder and Lull 1965;Jarvis et al. 1976;Rauner 1976;Geiger et al. 1995;McCaughey et al. 1997;Chen et al. 1999). The presence or absence of a canopy directly infl uences the amount of solar, photosynthetically active, and longwave radiation, the wind speed, and precipitation near the ground. Differences in these variables infl uence the air temperature and humidity regime and the soil temperature and moisture regime of the forest, edge, and openings.\n\nSolar radiation transmission through forest canopies depends on the height of the crown and the density and arrangement of foliage elements (Vézina and Pech 1964;Reifsnyder and Lull 1965;Federer 1971;Black et al. 1991;Canham et al. 1999). Reduction in solar radiation under forest cover ranges from more than 90% with dense canopies (Young and Mitchell 1994;Chen et al. 1995;Brosofske et al. 1997) to 50-70% in open stands (Reifsnyder and Lull 1965;Örlander and Langvall 1993). The forest canopy changes the spectral distribution of light because plant foliage differentially absorbs and reflects the various wavelengths (Vézina and Boulter 1966;Federer and  Tanner 1966;Atzet and Waring 1970;Yang et al. 1993). There is a greater reduction in the ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation ranges compared to longer solar radiation wavelengths. There are also some subtle differences in belowcanopy spectral distribution between hardwood and coniferous canopies.\n\nLongwave radiation to the forest fl oor increases as the canopy cover increases because the forest canopy is usually much warmer than the sky being blocked (Reifsnyder and Lull 1965;Cochran 1969;Carlson and Groot 1997). Although this increase somewhat offsets the reduction in solar radiation below the forest, net radiation below forest canopies is usually substantially lower than that in the open, although the difference is somewhat reduced when there is a snowpack. The high level of snow refl ectivity greatly reduces the solar radiation component of the net radiation.\n\nThe radiation regime in small openings varies throughout the day and year, depending on the extent of the shadow of the surrounding forest. The area of the opening in shade depends on the height of the surrounding trees and the size of the opening. The effect of the trees on downward longwave radiation in the opening decreases with distance away from the edge, and is negligible by about one tree height into the opening (Reifsnyder and Lull 1965;Cochran 1969).\n\nThe amount of precipitation intercepted by the forest depends on the canopy cover (Calder 1990;McCaughey et al. 1997;Pomeroy and Goodison 1997;Spittlehouse 1998a, b;Winkler 1999). Annual interception losses vary from 10 to 30%, and the fraction of precipitation intercepted decreases as storm size increases. The time since the previous storm, and the weather conditions during the current storm, both affect interception. Winter precipitation not intercepted and lost through sublimation from high-elevation forests is stored on the ground as snow. In spring, snowmelt is infl uenced by the weather, and by forest cover, including the distribution of gaps in the canopy (Woo et al. 2000). Forest cover can reduce snowmelt rates by up to 60% of those in the open, depending on stand characteristics (Winkler 1999;Winkler et al. 2004).\n\nForest canopies tend to reduce the diurnal air temperature range compared to large open areas. Maximum differences (opening minus forest) in daytime air temperature at the 1.5-2 m height vary from 3 to 6°c or more (Williams-Linera  1990; Young and Mitchell 1994;Chen et al. 1995;Cadenasso et al. 1997;Brosofske et al. 1997;Potter et al. 2001;Stathers et al. 2001). At night, forest areas are typically about 1°c warmer than in the open (Chen et al. 1995), although Brosofske et al. (1997) found temperatures about 1°c cooler above a stream. Surface and near-surface soil temperatures show the largest differences between forest and open sites, being up to 10-15°c cooler under forest canopies during the daytime and 1-2°c warmer at night (Chen et al. 1995;Brosofske et al. 1997;Stathers et al. 2001).\n\nThe vapour pressure of the air is mainly a function of the surrounding airmass and will be similar in the open and in the forest. Consequently, the relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit will depend on the air temperature. The lower daytime forest air temperature means that relative humidity is 5-25% higher in the forest (Williams-Linera 1990;Chen et al. 1995;Brosofske et al 1997). Wind speed beneath the forest canopy is commonly reduced to below the resolution of most anemometers (Raynor 1971;Chen et al. 1995).\n\nThe microclimate at the forest edge is a transition between the conditions of the forest interior and the open. Several studies (Table 1) in a wide range of forest types and climate have shown that much of the change in microclimate takes place within a distance equal to the mean height of the dominant and codominant trees (15-60 m) either side of the edge. These differences could influence plant growth near edges. For example, Groot and Carlson (1996) reported less frost damage to seedlings near the edge of small openings as a result of longwave radiative shielding. York et al. (2003) found increased height growth of seedlings on the north edge of small openings that was correlated with the increase in light levels relative to the south side (northern hemisphere site). Cienciala et al. (2002) and Taylor et al. (2001) found an increase in water use by trees at the edge of a large opening compared to interior trees, and ascribed this to the different edge microclimate.\n\nSolar radiation, wind speed, and soil temperatures change  from opening to interior forest conditions more rapidly than do air temperature and relative humidity. Edge orientation has an effect, particularly for a south-facing edge, where solar radiation penetrates some distance into the forest for much of the day. There is usually less difference in temperature between the east and west edges than between the north and south edges.\n\nThe transition from forest to clearing occurs mostly within the clearing, except at the north edge where the change occurs mainly in the forest. This happens because the north edge receives full sun most of the day, and sunlight penetrates into the forest (Chen et al. 1993;Young and Mitchell 1994;Cadenasso et al. 1997). Wind blowing directly into the edge penetrates farther into the forest than from other directions (Raynor 1971) and could result in raised temperatures up to three tree heights into the forest (Chen et al. 1995). Klassen et al. (2002) found a small enhancement of turbulent energy fl uxes over a forest downwind of the edge, and ascribed it to the disturbance of wind fl ow by the edge.\n\nThe research site is located south of the north fork of Sicamous Creek, 7 km north of Mount Mara and 7 km east-southeast of Sicamous (50° 50' n, 118° 55' w) at an elevation of 1530-1830 m.\n\nThe area is classifi ed as Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir, wet cold (ESSFwc2) (Lloyd et al. 1990). The forest is 35% Engelmann spruce and 65% subalpine fi r with 264 m 3 ha -1 live timber and 30% of standing trees as snags (Vyse 1997(Vyse , 1999)). The dominant trees are 22-27 m tall, and canopy closure is about 50%.\n\nThe treatment area is on a northwest-facing slope and the base weather station is to the west in a large opening with scattered regeneration (Figure 2). The treatments monitored in this study were 0.1-ha opening (c3), 1-ha opening (b4), 10-ha opening (b5), and forest (adjacent to b5). Details are presented by Spittlehouse and Adams (2001). Information from research at the Opax Silvicultural Systems Study and from the Penticton Creek Watershed Experiment is also included in the report.\n\nThe Sicamous base weather station was established in July 1993 in a 500-ha opening with scattered regeneration, on a gentle slope, at an elevation of 1570 m, 200 m southeast of the Sicamous Creek camp (Figure 2). Solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (par), air temperature and humidity, soil temperature, wind speed and direction, liquid precipitation, snow temperature, and snow depth were monitored using a data logger (Appendix 1). Hourly averages and totals, and daily averages, maximum and minimum values, and totals were collected. Environmental and human-caused failures in recording resulted in data gaps. Relationships developed between the base station and other weather stations were used to fill in the missing data. The British Columbia Forest Service fire weather station #2209, 15 km north of the research site at 1250 m elevation, was used for filling in missing May-September daily  temperature, and monthly relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. The Upper Penticton Creek Watershed Experiment at 1620 m elevation, 130 km south of Sicamous Creek, was used for monthly winter air temperature and humidity, solar radiation, and snow depth. Details are presented by Spittlehouse and Adams (2001).\n\nSolar radiation is dominant in the energy balance of the surface. Measurements of diffuse radiation at Sicamous (Huggard and Vyse 2002) and transects of photosynthetically active radiation across the edges of a 1-ha opening at the Opax Silvicultural Systems Study (D.L. Spittlehouse and L. Paterson, unpublished data) are presented here.\n\nThe Opax site is a 1-ha opening in an interior Douglasfir forest with about 60% canopy cover. Transects were made across the north and south edges under clear and partially cloudy conditions using a par sensor. Three point measurements, spatially separated by 3 m, were made at each location and the ratio of below-canopy par to that in the middle of the opening was calculated. The climo model (Chen et al. 1993) was used to calculate light levels across openings of different sizes. climo is based on canopy clumping at the scale of tree, branch, and shoot; it can take account of the time of year, and has been validated for clearings in complex terrain and on steep slopes.\n\nMeasurements were made at the centre of the b5 10-ha opening at 1750 m. uv-b (280-320 nm) was measured using a broadband uv-b radiometer (Solar-Lite Company Inc., Philadelphia, pa, model 501) at 10 m above the ground. The spectral response of the instrument is matched to the Diffey erythemal action spectrum (McKinlay and Diffey 1987). Hourly mean values were determined from 60-second samples, and out- put was recorded in minimal erythemal dosage (med) units and then converted to energy units (mW m -2 nm -1 and kJ m -2 d -1 ). Solar radiation was measured at the same location with a thermopile pyranometer (Eppley Laboratories model b&w). Both instruments were monitored with a data logger at 60second intervals, and daily uv-b dosages and daily total solar irradiance were calculated by integration of the hourly mean values. No correction was made for the small reduction in diffuse uv-b irradiance due to the reduction in the sky-view factor by the ridge to the south.\n\nThe response of living cells to ultraviolet radiation is dependent on the frequency of the radiation and the dosage in quantum units. Caldwell (1971) developed a generalized action spectrum for plant material in the uv-b spectrum based on the quantum response of cells and organelles. The Green weighting function (Bjorn and Teramura 1993) is used to convert from a quantum response to energy response. Conversion of the Sicamous Creek data to the Green function and evaluation of the effects of changing ozone thickness requires knowledge of the spectral distribution. The broad-band instrument assumes a spectral distribution based on an ozone column thickness of 270 Dobson units. Correction factors were developed using the spectral distributions for the normal ozone column thickness using the Diffey weighting and spectra measured on Saturna Island by the Meteorological Service of Canada. Trapezoidal integration of the spectra gave uv-b irradiance in weighted units of mW m -2 nm -1 . The increase in uv-b irradiance expected from a 20% reduction in ozone column thickness is similar for all three weighting functions (1.36-1.43). When converting mW m -2 nm -1 Diffey weighted to the Green weighted normalized to 300 nm, the Diffey value must be increased by 1.65 for normal ozone levels or by 1.73 for low ozone levels.\n\nFluxes of net radiation, soil heat, sensible heat, and water vapour were measured at three locations in the b5 10-ha opening during 1996 and 1997. Eddy-correlation systems were installed at 25, 50, and 200 m from the western edge of the 10-ha opening in an east-west line. Each station had two 1-d sonic anemom- eters (Campbell Scientifi c Incorporated [csi] model ca-27), a net-radiometer (Micromet Systems model q*6 and q*7), and soil heat fl ux plates (home-made). Two krypton hygrometers (csi model kh-20) were placed at 200 m to measure water vapour fl ux. An inter-comparison of instruments at the same location gave excellent agreement between the sensible heat fl ux density measured by the six sonic anemometers.\n\nField measurements took place in the 10-and 0.1-ha openings (Novak et al. 1997;Orchansky et al. 1997). Towers, 8-m tall, were established along the west-east mid-line of the 10-ha opening at 25,75,125,200,250, and 300 m from the west edge. The 0.1ha clearing, located 300 m north of the 10-ha clearing, had a tower in the centre. A wind speed and direction anemometer (RMYoung 05103) was mounted at about 25 m by climbing a tree between two 1-ha openings, topping the tree, and mounting the instrument at the top. Maximum gusts were evaluated using 1-, 10-and 60-second integration periods. Wind speed and direction anemometers were scanned at 5 Hz, and wind statistics were recorded half-hourly and daily. Wind tunnel studies were conducted in the University of British Columbia Department of Mechanical Engineering large blow-through wind tunnel using a model forest consisting of 15 cm high individual tree models simulating Engelmann spruce trees at a scale of 1:200 and a density equivalent to 500 stems ha -1 . Instantaneous wind speed was measured across scale models of 10-and 0.1-ha openings with a tri-axial hot-fi lm constant temperature anemometer (Novak et al. 1997;Orchansky et al. 1997).\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, snow depth and snow water equivalent (swe) were measured at 111 survey points throughout the 10-ha opening and into the adjacent forest along a north-south and a west-east transect.\n\nThree measurements were made at each  point and averaged to provide swe at -25, -12, -6, 0, 6, 12, 25, 50, and 100 m from the forest edges and in the centre of the opening (negative distances indicate position within the forest). Measurements were made using a standard Federal snow tube near the time of maximum accumulation (April 1) and during snowmelt (late May or early June). A Campbell Scientifi c Incorporated sr50 depth gauge was used to determine the daily snow depth at the weather station in the middle of the 10-ha opening during winter 1996/97. The data logger also monitored two snowmelt lysimeters that measured meltwater outflow from the base of the snowpack. The lysimeter boxes were fi breglass-covered plywood (2.4 × 1.2 × 0.15 m), draining into large tipping buckets.\n\nRainfall interception was not determined at Sicamous but was measured in two high-elevation Engelmann spruce-subalpine fi r and lodgepole pine forests in the dry, cold essf, 1620 m elevation, at the Upper Penticton Creek Watershed Experiment (Spittlehouse 1998b). Five 6 × 0.1-m, V-shaped troughs and fi ve stemflow collectors drained into tipping buckets monitored continuously with a data logger.\n\nTransects of soil and air temperature were installed from forest through the north, south, east, and west edges and into the 0.1-, 1-and 10-ha openings. Measurement locations for the 1-and 10-ha openings were -25, -12, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, and 50 m (negative distances indicate position within the forest) from the edge. The 0.1-ha transect terminated at 12 m into the opening. Air temperature was measured at 1.5 and 0.2 m above the ground, and soil temperature at 0.07 m below the surface. Commercially available sensors and radiation shields can have radiation errors of 2-3°c. Radiation errors were minimized using 30-gauge chromel-constantan thermocouple wire without a radiation shield. Even with these small sensors, the error can be up to 1°c under full sun and low wind speed. Soil temperature measurement is not subject to radiation errors but can have large spatial variability. Each soil temperature sensor consisted of three thermocouples and swamping resistors  connected in parallel to give a three-point average. Sensors were read at 60-second intervals using a data logger and multiplexer on each edge transect; hourly and daily values were recorded.\n\nProfiles of air and near-surface soil temperature were measured in the forest near the 10-ha opening during the summer of 1997. Thermocouples were placed at 27, 18, 9, 6, 3, and 1.5 m above and 0.07 m below the soil surface. The base weather station in the large opening had thermistors or thermocouples at 5.5, 3, 1.5, and 0.25 m above and 0.01, 0.15, and 0.5 m below the soil surface (Appendix 1).\n\nThe climate at Sicamous is cool and moist (Table 2). The mean annual air temperature is 1.2°c and mean daily temperature varies from 10°c in summer to -6°c in winter. Extreme daily maximum temperatures of 23-30°c occurred in summer, and extreme minimum temperatures of -25 to -36°c occurred in mid-winter. Soil temperature near the surface varies from 0°c during the winter to more than 20°c during the summer. The temperature range is much reduced at the 0.5-m depth, varying from 1 to 10°c. A wide range of air temperature conditions was experienced during the measurement period. The coldest winter temperatures were recorded in 1996, while 1998, an El Niño year, had an exceptionally warm spring and summer.\n\nThe wettest year (1280 mm of precipitation) was 1997, and 1998 the driest (700 mm) during the measurement period. Mean annual precipitation for the period is estimated to be 910 mm (Table 2). Summer (June-September) rainfall averaged 320 mm, with only 1998 having a dry summer (22 mm of rain in July and August). Permanent snow cover starts in late October and the maximum depth of the snowpack occurs in late March. There is a large inter-annual variation in the amount of snow, with annual maximum depth varying from 1.3 to 2 m during 1994-2002 (Table 3). Mean annual precipitation 910 mm table 2 Climate data for 1994-2002 for the base station in a 500-ha opening adjacent to the experimental area. PAR is photosynthetically active radiation, Tmax is average daily maximum temperature, Tmin is average daily minimum temperature, Ext is the period extreme, vpdmax is average maximum vapour pressure deficit, and WindMax is average daily maximum wind speed over 1 minute. Ta0.25m is the 0.25 m maximum and minimum air temperature, and Ts0.15m and Ts0.5m are the average daily 0.15 and 0.5 m soil temperatures. Monthly winter precipitation data are not available. Snowpack depth on April 15 was converted to water equivalent assuming a density of 0.35 Mg m -3 and added to the May to October precipitation record to get an estimate of annual precipitation. Solar radiation (MJ m -2 d -1 ) = PAR*0.488.  packs, peaking in early March 1999. At the start of spring melt, snow water equivalent averages 430 mm.\n\nMinimum relative humidity averages 40% during the summer and 70% in winter. The resulting daytime vapour pressure deficits are typically 1-2 kPa in summer, with extremes of over 3 kPa in some years. Wind tends to come from the southwest-west sector and the northeast-southeast sector. Wind is seldom from the north or south. The site is dominated by gentle, thermally generated valley winds for much of the year, flowing eastwards up the valley during the day and westwards down the valley at night. Even large-scale flows due to major weather systems are aligned with the valley. There is no difference in wind patterns between summer and winter. No intense windstorms occurred at the Sicamous Creek site between 1994 and 2002.\n\nThe peak daily uv-b dosage at Sicamous Creek, with normal ozone column thickness, was approximately 9.5, and the average daily dosage, approximately 5.5 kJ m -2 d -1 (Green weighted, normalized at 300 nm).

Date at which snowpack started to accumulate and date it disappeared are shown.\n\n site has about two-thirds of the potential total solar radiation during the summer due to the high frequency of cloud.\n\nThere is a higher proportion of uv-b in the diffuse component compared to solar radiation. Differences in the diurnal trend of solar and uv-b irradiance means that the relationship between hourly solar and hourly uv-b are non-linear. However, the daily uv-b dosages and daily total solar radiation were linearly related. Data from June 14 to July 19, 1997 gave uv-b=0.39+0.16*Solar (kJ m -2 d -1 Diffey weighted), with daily total solar radiation in MJ m -2 d -1 , adjusted r 2 = 0.88, and standard error of 0.35 kJ m -2 d -1 . This equation was used to estimate uv-b dosages for all years from 1993 to 2002 using measurements of solar radiation made at the base weather station. Daily peak dosage never exceeded 6 kJ m -2 d -1 (Diffey weighted) and no indication was found that uv-b irradiance was systematically higher in any years. The mean daily uv-b dosage for the period June 1-July 31 never exceeded 3.8 kJ m -2 d -1 (Diffey weighted).\n\nThe Sicamous Creek experimental site is 1500 ha, with a 300-m elevation difference between the base station and the uppermost treatment units. During the winter, mean daily air temperatures in the b5 10-ha opening are similar to those at the base station. However, from April to September the higher elevations are 2°c warmer than the base station. Maximum temperatures are similar but the base station averages 4-5°c cooler than b5. Differences of up to 10°c occur on clear calm nights. The differences are due to the topography of the site. At night, katabatic winds reduce the effect of radiative cooling by helping to move the cooled air off the slopes to the flatter valley bottom where it ponds. Most of the treatment blocks are on similar slopes and aspects, and would be expected to have similar conditions. A possible exception is the c3 10-ha opening, which has a complex topography. No major differences were found between the base station and b5 for wind speed, daytime humidity, solar radiation, and rainfall. There is a greater depth of snow and a delay in disappearance of the pack by 1-2 weeks in the treatment blocks. The topography may result in a greater catch of snow, and the northwesterly aspect results in a lower amount of  radiation for snowmelt. In summary, there is no large topoclimatic variation across the Sicamous Creek experimental site.\n\n5.2 microclimate of forest, edge, and opening\n\nMicroclimate (e.g., air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture) is a result of the absorption and loss of energy and precipitation at the surface. In a forest edge, the energy comes from sunlight; a portion is absorbed by a surface (either the forest canopy or the clearing surface) and the rest is refl ected. The absorbed energy increases the temperature of the surface and is transported away by wind (sensible heat fl ux), conducted down into the soil (soil heat fl ux), and used to evaporate water from the soil surface or for plant transpiration (latent heat fl ux). Energy is also lost from the surface as longwave (thermal) radiation. The microclimate can be predicted by considering the partitioning of these fl uxes. For example, during the daytime the conceptual model predicts that the warmest place in a clearing will be near the edge facing the sun. Wind speed at the edge is lower than toward the centre and the edge receives more solar radiation than the centre because some is refl ected from the trees at the edge. Similarly, the coolest point will be near the edge facing away from the sun. Most studies of edge microclimate are consistent with the conceptual model outlined above and with the results described below.\n\nDistributions for solar and photosynthetically active radiation are similar and will be discussed together under the term \"light.\" Figure 3 shows the typical light regime in 0.1-and 1-ha openings and adjacent forest. The trees shade most of the small opening for much of the day. Solar radiation penetrates up to 20 m into the north edge (south facing). Shading effects extend up to 20 m (one tree height) into the south side of the opening (north-facing edge). The climo model calculations show that openings need to be greater than two tree heights wide to have more than 50% of the area with light levels >90% of that above  the canopy (Figure 4). Aspect results in an increase in area in full sun for south-facing slopes compared to a horizontal surface, and a substantial decrease for north-facing slopes.\n\nWind-tunnel experiments predicted that a gradient in sensible heat flux density should occur across the opening due to variations in wind speed and turbulence as the wind moved across the opening. However, no consistent variation in sensible heatflux density could be detected across the opening (Appendix 2). There was a tendency for higher fluxes at the 200-m location with westerly winds. Sensible heat flux measured with a 3-d sonic anemometer was used to confirm that the slope of the clearing was not adversely affecting the 1-d anemometer measurements. The latent heat-flux density was low, probably because the clearing was mainly unvegetated and the soil surface was dry, thus reducing soil evaporation. The daytime Bowen ratio varied from 0.8 to 1.2. This is consistent with other values for a partially revegetated clearcut (Adams et al. 1991).  � �� �� �� �� ��� � � � � � � � � ���������������������������������� ���� ����������������������� ������������������������������ ����������������������� ������������������������������������������ figure 4 Infl uence of opening size on fraction of area with sunlight >90% of that\n\nabove the canopy for a fl at surface and for north, south, and west/east aspects with a 25% slope. Opening size is expressed as tree height. Data obtained using the CLIMO model (Chen et al. 1993).\n\nOpenings of less than 0.1 ha have wind speeds similar to those in the forest (Orchansky et al. 1997). In larger openings, the wind variation away from the edge depends on the wind direction (Figure 5). Measurements of wind speed across clearings of different sizes in the fi eld and in the wind tunnel are in excellent agreement when topographic features are considered. Wind speed is of importance because of concerns about blowdown of trees. Daily average maximum wind speeds are 5-6 m s -1 . These are sustained winds over 60 seconds. The highest hourly mean wind speed recorded since July 1993 was 5.5 m s -1 (19.8 km h -1 ), which is quite low compared to the values for coastal sites. Blowdown is related to the maximum gust speed. Maximum gusts were evaluated using 1-, 10-and 60-second integration periods, and the maximum gust speeds are close to a Weibull distribution. The 60-second integration  period resulted in lower indicated gust speeds. The similarity between the 10-and 1-second integration periods indicates that the duration of gusts must be between 10 and 60 seconds. The maximum gust recorded over two lengthy periods (July 1993-December 1994 and December 1997-October 1998) was 15 m s -1 . There were no major windthrow events during the experimental period at Sicamous Creek.\n\nOver the summer, about 24% of the rainfall was intercepted in the high-elevation forests at Upper Penticton Creek. This is consistent with data for interior and coastal forests reported elsewhere (Spittlehouse 1998a) and similar values are expected at Sicamous. About 30% of the snow was intercepted by the forest canopy, consistent with data for other interior of British Columbia forest sites (Winkler 1999).

Snow depth in the middle of the opening on April 1 was 1.4 m. Similar patterns were obtained in 1997, but, with a delayed melt season, the equivalent melt pattern occurred in early June.\n\nequivalent (swe) was found to be highly variable across the 10-ha opening and into the forest along all transects. The pattern of snow accumulation along the transects was consistent over the 2 years surveyed, which had winters of high (1996/97) and low (1997/98) snowfall. The effect of the edge on snow accumulation extended for up to 25 m into the clearcut (April 1 in Figure 6).\n\nIn 1997, snowpack ripening occurred over a period of roughly 10 days once average daily air temperatures remained above 0°c (Figure 7). By mid-May, the snow lysimeters measured water draining from the base of the snowpack at rates of 10-60 mm per day, depending on the weather. Melt rates are consistent with data reported by Winkler et al. (2004). As with snow accumulation, little difference in snow ablation was observed between the west and east edges, except that the slightly higher accumulations of snow were retained longer for roughly 50 m farther into the opening from the east edge than the west (Figure 6). Dramatic differences in snow ablation were observed between the north and south edges. Snow was retained  much later in spring along the south edge than the north, and into the opening for approximately 200 m from the south edge. These data are consistent with those reported at other study sites (e.g., Golding and Swanson 1986;Satterlund and Adams 1992). The patterns in snow ablation observed in the 10-ha opening are also consistent with results expected as a result of increased solar radiation and longwave radiation along the north (i.e., south-facing) edge, and the similar amounts of energy for snowmelt available at the west and east edges.\n\nThe warmer daytime air temperature in the large opening results in the relative humidity being 5-10% lower than in the forest. Edge effects on humidity are similar to those of air temperature (discussed below).\n\nThe temperature transects across each edge in the 10-ha and 1-ha openings (Figures 8, 9  �� �� ����������������������������� ���� � ��� ��� ��� �� �� ������� ������� ��������� ���������� °������������� �� ����������� ����������� figure 8 Daily maximum and minimum air temperature on north-south and west-east transects from the forest through the 10-ha opening, August 20, 1997. ����������������������������� ���� � ��� ��� �� �� �� �� ������� ������� ��� ����� ������������ �������������°�� ����������� ����������� figure 9 Daily maximum and minimum soil temperature on north-south and west-east transects from the forest through the 10-ha opening, August 20, 1997.  ����������������������������� � �� ��� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� ������� ������� ���������� ����������� �������������°�� ��������� ��������� figure 10 Daily maximum and minimum air and soil temperature on a west-east transect from the forest through the 1-ha opening, August 9, 1997.\n\n(Figure 3). This is due to the fact that net-radiation distribution, which determines the microclimate, is similar to the pattern of light distribution. Consequently, in the case of the 0.1-ha opening there is a small increase in light in the opening (Figure 3) and this has little effect on air and soil temperature (Figure 11). In the larger openings, most of the transition from forest to clearcut occurs within about 10 m of the edge. The clearcut is warmer during the day and the same temperature as, or slightly cooler than, the forest at night (Appendix 3). The difference in daily mean temperature between the clearcut and forest is about 1°c at 1.5 m and 0.3°c at 0.2 m in the air and 0.5°c in the soil (Appendix 4). The differences in monthly mean air temperature between the forest and opening were about 1°c. There is greater variability in the soil temperatures, but the same patterns are evident. The difference in soil temperature between the clearing and forest is about 3°c.\n\nAs expected, the largest variation between positions occurs at the edge. After sunrise, the north edge (south-facing) warms quickly and is 3-5°c warmer during the early afternoon than any of the other three edges. By late afternoon, the north edge is  shaded as the sun moves into the northwest quadrant. During the morning, the west and north edges are the warmest as they receive full sun. In the late afternoon, the east and south edges receive full sunshine and are warmest. Although the solar radiation received by the east and west edges is identical when integrated over a full day, the west edge does not become as warm in the morning as the east does in the afternoon. This effect is seen over a large range of scales from a single disk-trench up to a large valley-the maximum temperatures are higher on the slope that receives the afternoon sun because temperatures there have been increasing throughout the day before the full solar irradiance is incident.\n\nThe patterns in soil temperature are generally similar to those described for air temperature (Figures 9,10,and 11 and Appendix 4). The amplitude of the soil temperature wave at 0.07 m is reduced and it lags the air temperature wave by about 3 hours. Differences in vegetation cover and soil moisture within the opening result in a large spatial variation in soil temperature.  5.2.9 Air and soil temperature profi les Snow and vegetation cover infl uence the air temperature and soil temperature profi les. Maximum and minimum air temperatures occur close to the surface of each layer because these surfaces are where the energy exchange takes place. Typical profi les for sunny days are presented for a forest (near treatment block b5) in the summer and a large opening at the base weather station in the summer and winter. The daytime maximum temperature in the forest varied by only 2°c over 27 m (Figure 12), while the range was about 20°c over 6 m in an open area (Figure 13). The highest maximum temperature in the forest occurred at about 9 m above the ground. This temperature was similar to that of air well above the opening.

This is the same day as for the large opening shown in the right-hand side of Figure 13.  figure 13 Maximum and minimum air and soil temperature (°C) profiles for clear days, January 13 and August 5, 1997, in a large opening. Height of snowpack and vegetation indicated by horizontal lines.\n\nture was similar to that of air well above the opening. The profile maximum occurred at 1 m into the opening. The shallower profile and higher point of maximum temperature in the forest is the result of the absorbed energy being distributed throughout the canopy rather than in a shallow layer at the surface, as occurs in the opening. The forest nighttime temperature profile had a similar shape to the daytime one, with a range of 3°c.\n\nThe temperature increased from the soil to about 4 m and then decreased towards the top of the canopy. The opening shows a typical nighttime inversion with the lowest temperature close to the top of the vegetation (mainly grasses and forbs). The lower nighttime temperatures are a result of cold air draining from the treatment area and pooling in the valley. In the winter there is an air temperature inversion over the snowpack all the time. The snowpack has strong insulating properties so that in mid-winter the pack temperature increases with depth, and the soil temperature remains above freezing.\n\n� � � � � � � ��� ��� ��� ��� � �� �� �� �� �������������°�� ������� ������ ��� ��� ��� ��� ���������� ���� ����������  6 DISCUSSION 6.1 microclimate of forest, edge, and opening Much of the transition between the 22-27 m tall forest and openings at Sicamous Creek occurred within 20 m either side of the edge. Redding et al. (2003) found a similar effect in a soil moisture and temperature study conducted at Sicamous Creek in 2000. Results are consistent with a number of other studies listed in Table 1. These studies have shown that much of the change in microclimate takes place within a distance equal to the mean height of the dominant and co-dominant trees either side of the edge. The conceptual model of edge microclimate described earlier is supported by published studies and the Sicamous results.\n\nOpening size is the most important variable through its control primarily on solar radiation in the opening and secondarily on wind fl ow. Circular or square openings of 1 ha (four to fi ve tree heights wide at Sicamous) or greater have a microclimate typical of a larger open area over much of their area. Openings of less than 0.1 ha (about one tree height in diameter at Sicamous) have a microclimate similar to that of the forest. Carlson and Groot (1997), Potter et al. (2001), Stathers et al. (2001), and York et al. (2003) found similar results. The transition from forest to open conditions occurs quite rapidly as opening size increases above 0.1 ha. The conceptual model can be applied to openings that are strip cuts as long as an estimate of the radiation environment can be made (e.g., Halverson and Smith 1974). The climo model (Chen et al. 1993) can be also be confi gured to approximate a strip cut. View factors calculated for longwave radiation (Riefsnyder and Lull 1965;Cochran 1969) can also be applied to solar radiation (Carlson and Groot 1997).\n\nIn this wet subzone of the essf biogeoclimatic zone, cool air and soil temperatures and snow cover are the dominant fea-\n\ntures of the environment. The growing season is cool, moist, and short, and snow cover exists for 8 months. Differences between forest and opening temperature were not large. Probably the biggest change that would be experienced by plants and animals between forest and openings is in the solar or photosynthetically active radiation regime. Vegetation fl ushes in mid-to late June at the site. The critical period for summer frost injury is the period between bud swelling and the end of shoot elongation. In contrast to the drier subzones of the essf, where frosts during this period are frequent and severe (Steen et al. 1990), there appears to be minimal danger of severe frost injury at the Sicamous Creek site. Considering the large amount of water from snowmelt and summer rainfall, and relatively low summer evaporative demand, it is unlikely that soil moisture stress is signifi cant at this site in most years. Conifers are most susceptible to uv-b injury during fl ushing and elongation when the wax cuticle is not fully developed. Lodgepole pine and mid-to high-elevation Engelmann spruce are relatively resistant to uv-b, requiring a constant daily dosage of 8 kJ m -2 d -1 (Green weighted, normalized at 300 nm) to cause some injury (L'Hirondelle and Binder 2002). The peak daily uv-b dosage at Sicamous Creek, with normal ozone column thickness, would be approximately 9.5, and the average daily dosage, approximately 5.5 kJ m -2 d -1 (Green weighted, normalized at 300 nm). The Sicamous Creek site has about twothirds of the potential total solar radiation during the summer due to the high frequency of cloud. Thus it is unlikely that visible injury due to uv-b would occur even if ozone column thickness decreased by 20% (increasing uv-b irradiance by up to 40%).\n\nEdge microclimate can influence plant growth. Huggard and Vyse (2002) report negative effect on tree growth on the south edge relative to the centre at Sicamous Creek. Brand et al. (2000) suggest that effects of openings on lichens and mosses extend some distance from the north edge.\n\nFrom a hydrologic perspective, the reduced interception of precipitation through forest removal increases the amount of  water available for streamfl ow. Snow disappears more rapidly in openings than in the forest, with the result that if suffi cient area of a watershed is harvested there can be signifi cant changes in the timing and volume of spring peak streamfl ow. The infl uence of the edge on the total amount of snowmelt from an opening will depend on the ratio of the edge opening area. It is likely that the small (0.1-ha) harvested openings had little effect on snow accumulation and snowmelt relative to the forest. This is because they have similar microclimates, and because stems in the forests are clumped, with many gaps similar in size to the openings.\n\nResults from this study are consistent with numerous other studies in different forest and climatic conditions. Much of the change in microclimate takes place within one mean height of the dominant and co-dominant trees on either side of the forest/opening edge. At Sicamous Creek this is 20-25 m either side of the edge.\n\n• Radiation below the canopy is 20-30% of above-canopy values. • Openings of less than 0.1 ha (one tree height [25 m] wide or less) have radiation regimes similar to those of the forest. • Openings of greater than 1 ha (>four tree heights [100 m] wide) have more than 75% of the opening with a radiation regime at the ground similar to that above the canopy. • Edge effects on light extend to less than one tree height either side of the edge. • North and south edges are not symmetrical.\n\n• Edge effects extend to less than one tree height (25 m) either side of the edge.\n\n• Openings of less than 0.1 ha have low wind speeds, similar to those of the forest.\n\n• In larger openings, the wind variation away from the edge depends on the wind direction.\n\n• The forest canopy intercepts 20-30% of the rain and snow.\n\n• Edge effects on snow accumulation extend less than one tree height (25 m) into the clearcut. • Snow accumulations are higher and snow disappears later at the shaded south edge of the opening. • Snowmelt rates in late spring in large openings can be more than 50 mm d -1 .\n\nAir temperature • Openings of less than 0.1 ha have air temperatures similar to those of the forest. • Large openings have maximum air temperatures 2-3°c greater than those of the forest.
