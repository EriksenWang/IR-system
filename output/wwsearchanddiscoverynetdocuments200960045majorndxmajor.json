    "abstract": "The ooid sand shoals of the Joulters Cays area of Great Bahama Bank were chosen for detailed sedimentologic study to investigate patterns of internal heterogeneity within a modern carbonate sand deposit and to develop criteria for predicting the lateral extent of porous and permeable carbonate sandstone facies in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Using aerial photographs, surface observations, and shallow coring, we documented three sedimentary facies in a 2.7-km 2 (1-m 2 ) study area dominated by mobile ooid sands. Cores were collected at the same spacing characteristic of wells in mature hydrocarbon reservoirs.\nThe shoal crest at the locality had aggrading and northward-prograding (parallel to depositional strike) washover bars composed of crossbedded, well sorted ooid sands. Burrowed, poorly sorted ooid sands were present seaward of the washover bars, and poorly sorted ooid sand and mud occupied a stabilized area bankward of the actively migrating shoal and in local areas between washover bars of the crest of the shoal. Intraclast-rich zones and mud layers were also present. The shoal was crosscut by tidal channels, and older washover bars were in the process of being dissected by tidal currents.\nWe anticipate that, upon burial and compaction, the poorly sorted ooid sand and mud facies will most likely retain negligible porosity and permeability, whereas both the well sorted ooid sand and poorly sorted ooid sand facies will maintain their high initial porosity and permeability. However, in many ancient subsurface reservoirs, rocks with depositional textures similar to the well sorted ooid sand facies have undergone considerable cementation and have low resultant porosity and permeability. Thus, in many settings, the poorly sorted ooid sand facies could retain the highest porosity and",

Our choice of Joulters Cays provided an unanticipated additional opportunity when Hur-ricane Andrew p a d over this area on August 23,1992,.providing us with an opportunity to contrast aedrmentary features formed over the course of several decades with those formed during an infrequent (on a human time scale) high-energy depdtional evsnt.\n\nThe Joulters Cays area, immediately north of Andm Island on Great Bahama Bank (Figure 1).\n\ndisplays a variety of environments in which ooid sands can accumulate. The Joulters Cays shoal is a 400-bm' (156mi9 sand flat, partly cut by numerous tidal channels and facing borders by mobile san y s (Harris, On the --1979, 1983). This active border of mid sands, 0.6 to 2 lon (0.3 to 1.2 mi) wide across depmitional dip, artends the length of the shoal for 25 hn (15.6 mi) along its windward side and terminates a b ~p * to the east (seaward) onto the shelf margin (FSgure 1). 'Ib the weat (platformward), mobile aand~ grade into the mi r d a l sand-flat part of oal and e v e n -e deeper water platform interior. Joulters Cays are three islands that lie within the active area of the shoal. The area of detailed study described herein is a proximately 2.7 kms (1 mi3 of mobile wid san & (mobile bar) lyhg just north of tbe northernmost of the Joulters (Figure 1).\n\nThe relief of the Joulters Cays shoal above the surrounding sea floor results primarily from mid sands accumulating in the d i e bar and stabilized flat (Figure 1). The mobile bar is a narrow belt along the active oceaefadng shoal magin where wid accumulation coincide8 with mid fop mation. Ooid and muddy he-grained peloid sands, the more widespread sediment typae exposed on the stabilized flat, result from ooids mixing with other grain types and with carbonate mud. The aids exceed 7 m (25 ft) in thickmas in the area of the Joulters Cays islanda The bask fa& pattern as revealed by regional corinu within the 6hoal (Harria. 1979(Harria. .1988) is a -of mid sand bordering oipoain wedges of r muddy mid mnd underlain by muddy, e-grained peloid oand. Ooidoand direct& overlies Pleihcene hestone bedrock along the Seaward margin of the shoal and inter6ngers with muddier sediments bankward. Throughout most of the sand flat, the vertical sue~ession consists of lithoclast sand and/ or pellet mud at the base, muddy, fine-graiaed peloid sand in the middle, and muddy mid sand a t the top. This succession shows distinct upward trends of inweaning grain size, sorting, ooid content, stratification, and grain-supported fabric.\n\nRegionally, the ssuecaeeion thine to the south a8 the underlying Pleistocene bedrock surface rises.\n\nExploration-scale heterogeneity of the Joulters Cays shoal is inferred on the basis of the distribution of depositional facies. Clean wid sand along the active margin of the shoal occurs as subtidalbar, channel-fill, beach, and island facies. High initial porosity was measured in similar clean sand by Halley and Harris (1979) and Enos and Sawatsky (1981), and it is confirmed here by thinsection estimation. Immediately bankward of the clean ooid sand are widespread, somewhat irreylarly shaped layers containing mixtures of carbonate mud and sand that will most likely result in rocks having vastly different reservoir properties. An upper layer of muddy ooid sand thins bankward and overlies a more widespread lower layer of muddy, fine-grained peloid sand. These layers will most likely have initial porosities lower than those of the more seaward, clean ooid sand, judging from measured values of similar sands by Enos and Sawatsky (1981) and from thin-section estimations. In addition, the upper layer will likely have better reservoir quality than the lower layer because of larger grain size and lower mud content.\n\nThree depositional subfacies predominate within the wid-sand (mobile bar) facies of H a m s (1979,1983).

The surface of the shoal crest is characterized by washover bars having curved axes mnvex in a bankward direction. The stoss sides of these bars slope seaward a t 10 to 20 degrees; the lee sides slope platformward a t approximately 20 to 30 degrees. These features are composed entirely of the well-sorted wid sand facies. The geometry of washover bars and movement of wids during the semidiurnal tidal cycle suggest that these features are largely built by incoming tides. Poorly sorted wid sand is present on the seaward margin of the shoal and in the bankward, shallow subsurface part of the shoal. The poorly sorted wid sand and mud facies accumulated in lower energy areas between washover bars on the crest of the shoal, where it is stabilized by filamentous algae. and in an area bankward of the active shoal, where i t is stabilized by the sea grass Thalassia. The distribution of these facies within the detailed study area (Figure 2) is shown on cross sections in Fi y r e 3. Differences in grain size, grain sorting, and sedimentary structures among these three facies will potentially lead to heterogeneity. I t should be emphasized that these sediments are unconsolidated. Were these sediments to be lithified, it is anticipated that well-sorted wid sand and poorly sorted ooid sand would become grainstones and poorly sorted wid sand and mud would become a packstone (terminology of Dun-ure 3 for scale.\n\nham, 1962). As will be discused in more detail in a following section, these subtle changes in depositional facies (as well as diagenetic overprint) would, upon burial, respond to compaction and cementation differently and probably result in significant permeability variability within a single grainstone depositional cycle or reservoir flow unit.\n\nThe well-sorted mid sand facies consists of 80 to 90 percent ooids (dominantly 0.4 to 0.5 mm in diameter), 5 to 20 percent coated pellets and unidentified grains (generally less than 0.2 mm in diameter), and 5 percent skeletal fragments. Scattered, poorly cemented intraclasts consist of broken burrow linings and hardground crusts. The sparse, somewhat rounded skeletal material includes fragments of pelecypods, gastropods, green alga Halimeda, peneroplid foraminifers, and red alga Goniolithon. Structures include crossbedding. horizontal burrows, tracks. and trails; vertically lined burrows; and horizontal and inclined laminations.\n\nThe well-sorted ooid sand facies coincides with the intertidal, most highly agitated central and seaward parts of the active shoal. This facies occurs a t the surface in a broad band that is approximately 1.8 km (1 mi) wide in the south part of the study area and narrows to only 1 km (0.6 mi) toward the north. This facies, which is nearly 3 m (10 ft) thick in some locations, is most widespread in the lower, older part of the shoal, generally narrowing and shifting seaward stratigraphically upward. In washover bars (discussed below), however, this facies is consistently wider a t the surface because these bars shift bankward over the less agitated surface environments (Figure 3).\n\nThe poorly sorted mid sand facies contains 60 to 80 percent ooids (0.4 to 0.5 mm in diameter), 20 to 40 percent coated pellets and unidentified grains (0.1 to 0.2 mm in diameter), and 5 percent skeletal fragments. The skeletal fragments (primarily in the upper few centimeters) are from pelecypods, gastropods, Halimeda, peneroplid foraminifers. and Goniolithon. Burrows are common, and there are no laminations.\n\nThe poorly sorted ooid sand facies accumulated in a less agitated environment than the-well-sorted ooid sand facies and occurs seaward of it a t the surface and both seaward and bankward of it in the shallow subsurface (Figure 3). This facies is as much as 1.3 m (4 ft) thick and occurs in water depths of approximately 0.5 m (1.5 ft) a t low tide; it is found in greater thicknesses where exposed a t the surface on the seaward side of the shoal.\n\nThis facies contains a trace to 20 percent carbonate mud, 30 to 70 percent ooids, 20 to 40 percent coated pellets and unidentified grains, and 5 to 20 percent skeletal fragments. Burrows, the common structure in the cores, are expressed a t the surface as mounds and depressions. Roots from the sea grass Thalassia are also common; living Thalassia and Gonwlithon occur on the surface. Sparse, small bushes of Halimeda are present, particularly in the transition zone between this facies and the well-sorted ooid sand facies. n m WWM depositional dip) cross sections OTO AI u based on cores collected before ~~ ~ ~ --passage of Hurricane Andrew.

Similar deposits are accuare prevalent. mulating in troughs on the presenbday surface.\n\nThe poorly sorted wid eand and mud fades occurs within the upper 1 m (3 ft) of the stratigraphic seetion and is present a t the surface on the very shallow water (several centimeters deep a t low tide), bankward side of the shoal and in low areas between washover bars composed of well-sorted wid sand. This facies grades downward and in some locations seaward into the poorly sorted wid sand facies (Figure 3). It is stabilized by filamentous algae in low areas on the crest of the shoal and by Thalassia on the bankward side of the shoal. Coat ings of algae and Thalassia give the surface a darker color on aerial photographs (Figure 2).\n\nSparsely cemented intraclasts, including fragments of burrow linings and broken hardgrounds that have been cemented by various amounts of aragonite cement, are concentrated in thin zones less than 0.5 m (1.5 ft) thick in many of the cores. In these zones, as many as 30 percent of the sediment is intraclasts or large shell fragments. 40 to 84 percent are ooids, and as many as 70 percent These intraclast-rich zones are most common in the lower part of the well-sorted wid sand facies in the north part of the study area. In cores, these zones are best represented on the seaward side of the cross section in Figure 3c, where they occur in an ofnapping pattern that reflects the progradation of the shoal complex. These zones were correlated laterally as far a s 600 m (1,970 ft) during sediment probing and were traced even farther by H a m s (1979) in that regional study. Although the zones are partly lithified, porosity and permeability have not been greatly reduced in the intraclasts, as estimated by thin-section observations, but these zones could potentially form bamers to fluid flow should they subsequently serve a s preferential nucleation sites for additional cementation.\n\n' h o discrete mud layers, the upper layer 2 em (0.8 in) thick and the lower layer 4 em (1.6 in) thick, separated by 4 cm of poorly sorted wid sand occur a t the top of the burrowed, poorly sorted wid sand facies in core D3 (Figure 3b). Because these mud layers were not recovered in any other core, the layers are presumably lbcal in distribution (which is mmborated by posthurricane field observations of discontinuous mud layers on the surface of the shoal, reported below) and of only minor importance from a reservoir heterogeneity perspective. Other occurrences of mud layers associated with ooid sands in the Bahamas were reported in tidal channels by Boardman and Carney (1091) and Shinn et al. (1993). Because of some variability in the localized settings where mud can be deposited and preserved in direct association with ooid sands. some mud layers probably will have greater lab era1 extent and greater importance a s potential low-permeability layers and fluid-flow barriers.\n\nDevelopment-scale patterns of heterogeneity within the active part of the Joulters Cays shoal are inferred from the facies distribution (Figures 2 and 3). The well-sortnd ooid-sand facies occurs ~P O M M . d w U n d F T d y I M d w u r d .ndmubmu.\"f. h w y I O ( * 6 0 0 1 d M M d -*D..\n\nin the center of the shoal complex where the entire area (305 to 607 m [1,000 to 2,000 ftl wide and 1.8 to 2.4 m [6 to 8 ftl thick) is exposed a t low tide.\n\nThe poorly sorted mid sand facies occurs both bankward and seaward of the well-sorted wid sand facies. Although the limits of the poorly sorted widsand facies were not encountered in this study, the regional study of H a m s (1979) indicates that it forms a very narrow band seaward of the shoal and occurs over a very broad area several kilometers wide on the platformward side; the poorly sorted wid sand facies and associated poorly sorted wid sand and mud facies are 0.6 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 n) thick a t the shoal and thin platformward.\n\nHeterogeneity is inferred because of mud content, burrowing, and grain type variations. These subtle variations occur on a scale of a few hundreds of meters (approximately 1,000 ft), which is consistent with well spacing in mature hydrocarbon reservoirs like those of the Permian Basin. The scale of variation illustrated here should thus be considered when correlating a t the common develop ment interwell scale. In addition, the heterogeneity portrayed here occurs within a single facies (ooid sands) as identified within the more regional.\n\nexploration-scale core study of Harris (1979). By analogy, similar subtle textural variations can be expected to produce local heterogeneity within mid grainstone reservoirs.\n\n'lb better understand and calibrate the stratigraphy and facies patterns observed in cores Figure In 1947 (Figures 4a and 5a), the well-sorted mid sand facies was spread across nearly the entire north Joulters Cays study area. The poorly sorted ooid sand and mud-Thalassia facies on t h e bankward (west) side of the bar virtually matches the present-day position of this facies. The poorly sorted ooid sand and mud-filamentous algae facies occurred on the north end of the bar, where northward-prograding washover bars of wellsorted ooid sand had not yet migrated. A relatively small area of poorly sorted wid sand occurred on the seaward margin in approximately the center of the study area. Note that the major washover bars in the south part of the study area were not dissected by tidal channels, presumably because the bars had sufficiently low topography that receding tides were able to drain uniformly acmss the bars without causing significant erosion.\n\nBy 1967 (Figures 4b and Sb), the washover bars of well-sorted ooid sand had migrated to the north end of the study area. In the south part of the study area, washover bars had aggraded to a sufficient height that receding tidal currents were beginning to erode bar crests. The areas between washover bar highs contained poorly sorted wid sand and mud-filamentous algae. Note that the washover bar in approximately the middle of the study area was partly dissected and that the crest of the bar was then approximately midway between the seaward and bankward margins of the study area.\n\nIn 1989 (Figures 4c and 5c), when cores used to construct the cross sections in Figure 3 were collected, the washover bars in the south part of the study area were severely dissected by tidal currents, and large areas contained poorly sorted mid sand and mud-filamentous algae. The washover bar in approximately the center of the study area had migrated bankward and nearly reached the margin of the poorly sorted wid sand and mud-Thalassia facies, which has remained remarkably stable for a t least 40 yr.\n\nThe pattern illustrated by these changes that were recorded by aerial photographs suggests aggradation of washover bars and progradation northward by longshore drift. As the washover bars both aggrade and prograde, they form a bamer to seaward drainage of tide waters. In the south part of the study area, washover bars have thus been dissected by tidal currents. We anticipate that if this pattern continues without interruption, with further progradation northward and aggradation in the center of the study area, the central tidal channel will deepen and widen and the central washover bars will be dissected.\n\nHurricane Andrew, a category 4 hurricane with wind velocities of approximately 240 km/h (150 mil h), passed over Joulters Cays in a westerly direction on August 23, 1992. Before the passing of Hurricane Andrew, the study area (Figures 4c and 5c) displayed distinctive surface features dominated by tidal current washover bars (light areas) that extended 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 ft) above sea level a t low tide and were flooded by only a few centimeters (1 to 3 in) of water at high tide. The bar crests typically were embellished by variously oriented symmetrical ripples. These topographically high features provided nominal protection for sparsely grass-stabilized areas (dark areas on the bankward side of the shoal), in which grains were less well sorted and some carbonate mud accumulated, and also provided some protection for filamentous-algae-stabilized areas between washover bars on the crest of the shoal, where slightly muddy sediment also accumulated.\n\nHumcane Andrew passed from east to west over the study area, and the center of the storm was just north of the Joulters Cays ooid shoal (Figure 6). Winds blew over the shoal generally from west to east because of the counterclockwise rotation of the storm cell. Consequently, sediment was transported seaward off the shoal. The boundary between the active, high-energy part of the shoal and the grass-stabilized area to the west remained relatively unchanged after the passing of the storm thick (foot-thick) layer of well-sorted ooids. The posthumcane relief across the active part of the shoal is reduced, and the surface is now relatively featureless. Ooids-not trapped in low areas on the shoal were transported seaward.\n\nVery thin (a few millimeters to 1 em thick), laterally discontinuous layers of carbonate mud, generally no more than a few square meters in area, were observed on the surface of the shoal crest a t low tide. Tide floodwaters observed a few weeks after Humcane Andrew contained lame amounts Cays mid shoals caused by Hurricane Andrew were profound, but they will probably be only partly preserved. Prevailing winds and currents that caused formation of the aggrading and northwardprograding washover bars illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 will, in all likelihood, reestablish the pattern of well-sorted ooid sand washover bars flanked seaward by poorly sorted ooid sand and flanked bankward and in low areas on the crest by poorly sorted ooid sand and mud. Although the storm layer of well-sorted ooid sand may be preserved in some low areas on the crest of the shoal. we have of suspended carbonate mud, suggesti<g that mud not found recognizable ooid storm beds from preon the shoal crest was delivered to this depositional vious storms in the prehumcane cores we collected site by tide waters.\n\non the shoal crest.\n\nThe changes in surface features of the Joulters Those mids swept seaward by easterly (counter-clockwise) storm currents will most likely be preserved in areas normally having less agitated conditions, where fine-grained sediments are normally deposited. Indeed, Harris (1979) reported ooid grains, many of them rnicritized, in cores collected a few kilometers seaward of our study area. Because prevailing tidal currents transport ooids bankward rather than seaward, those ooids in seaward locations may be the result of earlier storms. The thin, discontinuous mud layers deposited on the crest of the shoal probably have relatively low preservation potential. Several months after Hurricane Andrew passed over the study area, we obsewed diurnal tides resuspending these muds. (Shinn e t al. [I9931 reported a similar observation on ooid shoals a t Cat Cay, Bahamas.) Moreover, the very discontinuous nature of these deposits suggests that they had a t one time been much larger. However, if prevailing tidal currents reestablish washover bars before the mud deposits are completely removed, some of the deposits may be preserved beneath washover bars. There they will provide local permeability bamers when these sediments are buried and lithified. Indeed, shallow subsurface mud layers on the shoal crest, such as the pre-Andrew layer observed in core D3 (Figure 3b), probably formed by this process during an earlier storm. Although the preservation potential of this mud layer is low on the shoal crest, preservation in adjacent tidal channels is almost a certainty. After Hurricane Andrew passed over Joulters Cays, Shinn e t al. (1993) reported thin beds (as much as 5 em [2 in1 thick) of laminated carbonate mud in troughs of wid dunes and ripples in high-energy subtidal channels of Joulters Cays. They proposed that a slurrylike mixture of carbonate mud, which resulted from the passing of Hurricane Andrew. moved through the channels. As the storm winds and currents waned, mud settled to the channel floor and was preserved in ripple troughs. Shinn et al. (1993) proposed that an older, more compacted mud layer stratigraphically below the Hurricane Andrew mud layer is also a storm deposit.\n\nBoardman and Carney (19911, whose investigation predated Hurricane Andrew, attributed the older mud layer in these tidal channels to direct precipitation from seawater a t a time when the tidal channel was separated from the open sea by migrating mid sand bars. The mud layers deposited in tidal channels will be important, albeit local, permeability bamers when these sands have been buried and lithified. Note in Figure 1 that although the tidal channels are local phenomena, their linear extent is as much as three-quarters of the width of the shoal.\n\nCarbonate grainatones analogous to the sediments investigated a t Joulters Cays are hydrocarbon reservoirs of various geologic ages (Peryt, 1983;Harris, 19W. Roehl and Choquette, 1985;Keith and Zuppann, 1993). Hydrocarbons are produced from Mississippian mid grainstone reservoirs in the 11linois, Anadarko, Appalachian, and Williston Basins and the Hugoton Embayment (Keith and Zuppann, 1993). The most prolific area of production from Mississippian mid grainstones is the IIlinois Basin, where the Ste. Genevieve Limestone accounts for 743 million barrels (MMbbl) of oil, or 18 percent of the cumulative production from the basin (Keith and Zuppann, 1993). In the Hugoton Embayment of southwestern Kansas. Damme field has produced 13 MMbbl of oil from Mississippian ooid grainstone shoal facies (Handford. 1988;Parham and Sutterlin, 1993). Grainstones, although not exclusively ooid grainstones, are a principal reservoir facies in the San Andres and Grayburg Formations of the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, which have a combined cumulative production of 7.7 billion barrels, or 46 percent of the oil produced from the entire basin (Bebout and Harris, 1990). Grainstones of Jurassic Arab-C and Arab-D reservoirs of the Middle East, many of which are mid grainstones, are prolific reservoirs; indeed, the giant Qatif field of Saudi Arabia alone has an estimated ultimate recovery of 9 MMbbl of oil (Halbouty et al., 1970;Wilson, 1985). Jurassic ooid grainstone reservoirs also occur in northern Louisiana and eastern Texas (Ventress e t al., 1984) and the Paris Basin, France (Cussey and Friedman, 1977;Purser, 1978). Cretaceous mid grainstones are oil and gas reservoirs in the Gulf Coast of Texas (Bebout and Loucks, 1977;Fitchen et al., 19971, and in the Middle East (Longacre and Ginger, 1988).\n\nDepositional facies variability and early diagenetic alteration both contribute to reservoir-scale h e t erogeneities in the carbonate sand deposits of Joulters Cays area and potentially in ancient analogs. For example, interwell-scale heterogeneities in hydrocarbon reservoirs of the San Andres and Grayburg Formations of the Permian Basin have been documented on a scale of hundreds of meters or less (Bebout e t al., 1987;Ruppel and Cander, 1988;Bebout and Hams, 1990;H a m s and IVaker, 1990a.b;Longacre, 1990;Major et al., 1990). The details of this level of variability have been shown in outcrop analogsfor these same reservoirs in the Guadalupe Mountains (Kerans and Nance, 1991;Grant et al., 1994;H a m s e t al., 1994;Barnaby and Ward, 1995;Kerans and Fitchen, 1995;Kerans et al.. 1995).\n\nThin-section examination demonstrates that both the well-sorted mid sand facies and poorly sorted mid sand facies of the Joulters Cays area were mud free and had high initial porosity a t the time of deposition (Halley and Hams. 1979). In some an-cient subsurface settings, however, similar wellsorted ooid grainstones a r e cemented by calcite or anhydrite cement and have iow resultant porosity (Bebout e t al., 1985;H e m s and Walker, 1990a,b;Longacre, 1990). I n these ancient settings, the more poorly sorted mid or peloid grainstones and packsto~es commonly retain primary porosity and thus become the better reservoir facies.\n\nAt Joultera Cays, t h e poorly sorted w i d sand fac i e ~ occurs on t h e seaward and landward sides of the well-sorted mid sand facies and also underlies the poorly sorted ooid sand and mud facies. If the early-cemented intraclasts that we encountered a s layers in the Joulters Cays shoal were to act a s nucleating sites of later cements, layers of tightly cemented ooids could form impermeable barriers a s much a s 0.6 m (2 ft) thick within the otherwise permeable facies, causing a reservoir to become vertically partitioned.\n\nCore samples of modem carbonate sediments collected from Joulters Cays a t a spacing comparable to well spacing in a mature Permian Basin oil field indicate the three-dimensional complexity of an upward-coarsening and upward-shallowing stratigraphic section. This modem example illustrates t h e difficulties in interpreting and correlating grainstone zones in subsurface studies of platform carbonate reservoirs. Formation of this sand body, local shoal stabilization and reworking by b u m wing, and generation of hardground layers all result in features that a r e significant a t a develop ment scale. Additionally, facies patterns produced by migrating sand bars within the active parts of the shoal are impacted by short-term storm events."
