    "full_text": "The United States economy is about to complete its tenth year of secular stagnation. It will celebrate that anniversary in an atmosphere of a strong economic recovery, but a recovery that began with the unemployment rate at a new post-Great Depression high of over 10 percent. One result of this growth slowdown has been the emergence of a new structural unemployment issue: high rates of unemployment among semi-skilled and skilled workers who had previously exhibited a record of employment stability. In this paper we shall focus on this issue and examine its shortand long-run manifestations and policy implications.\n\nThe displaced worker problem has clearly been exacerbated by the current recession. To what extent, however, will the ongoing recovery, if sustained, provide a complete cure? That is, will the equilibrium unemployment rate be higher over the next several years as a consequence of increased structural unemployment among displaced workers? Some argue that the number of displaced workers, reflecting trends in technological change and international trade, is on a long-run uptrend. According to this view, the displaced worker phenomenon is an early warning indicator of a mismatch problem, particularly in manufacturing, between the available supply of and demand for production workers.\n\nTypically, a discussion of labor market problems and policies,\n\nResearch suppoa for this study was provided by the General Electric Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. The views expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent those of General Electric, NIH, or the Reserve System. especially when un6hplOyment rates are high, focuses on training and job creation poficies. We shall do this to some degree, but the essence of our arguiiient is somewhat different.\n\nFirst, in the sumher of 1983, it is difficult to recommend a new round of employmebt h d training policies. The implications of the budget deficit for employment over the longer run make it more likely that govemmdrit expenditures should be decreased rather than increased. In additibil, the record of the 1970s suggests that labor market policies tend to be pro rather than countercyclical, perhaps even more so than other stabilization policies. As the current recession again proves, policy debate over cyclical unemployment tends to begin in earhest about the time that the economy reaches its recession trough. ~undin$ for new jobs thus begins at the time that private sector employmeht is growing strongly. Of course, there is always the chance that the cbrfent recovery will be short lived, so that 1983 versions of eniployment policy would fortuitously prove to be timely. The perverde timing of employment programs, however, appears to be endemic rather than simply bad luck in forecasting. ' Secondly, the underlying problem facing displaced workers does not involve employhent difficulties or a shortage of jobs; rather, it involves wages. Disblaced workers, by definition, have accumulated a certain amount of job-sIjecific human capital and/or have been paid a union wage pr'emiuin. This means that the displaced workers have opportunity wages that are lower -and at times considerably lower than the wages attained in their last jobs. Their jobs can be restored, but nbi their old wage rates. The mismatch in the labor market is thus due to a hismatch of displaced workers' wages on their past jobs with their opportunity wages on new jobs.\n\nThe record df the past decade suggests that the American economy has no difficulty creating jobs that -fit the labor force. Although the 1970s compare unfavorably with the 1960s with respect to almost all economic indicators, one exception has been employment growth. While employment increased at an average of 1.9 percent per year during the high-growth, low-inflation 1960s, it grew at an average of 2.4 percent per year during the low-growth, high-inflation 1970s. The problem &a of the last decade has not been job creation but rather real wage growth. In 1979, even before the two recessions of of the 1980s, real wages were no higher than they had been in 197 1. By 1982, real wages had fallen to levels first at@ined in 1967.\n\nThe U.S . labor market has also exhibited another , trait . over the past decade: a high variance in interindustry wage changes. The time series of wages across industries exhibits an inkieasing coefficient of variation over time. The increased variance t h+$ hgs p n occurring since the early 1970s has resulted in a widening of the interindustry wage structure. Whereas union-nonunion or Fgh h e -l o w wage industry wage differentials exhibited little s~qylq-change between the early 1950s and the late 1960s, they havi i$cr&ped persistently over the 1970s.\n\nAs a consequence, although real wages have declined for most American workers, some groups have either avdjded or mitigated the decline. In a number of manufacturing indusMt$s, for exa-mple, real wage growth has been well above that achieved by oFher American workers. It is likely that the severity of the displafed worker phenomenon is an outgrowth of the intersection of tb,e recession and the increased variance in the employment and w@<,styc&res.\n\nSpecifically, the income loss to displaced workers is greater the larger the wage premium they enjoy over thqit oppgrtunity wage. Moreover, the higher the union wage pregiwi,.9r tbi $re.pium not dictated by job-specific human capital, the gteatkr the likelihood that workers will be displaced. In fact, the pulling pp ' . J? of ?he wage struc-.\n\nture has been quantitatively large enough to exp.pin ! much of the dis-, placement that has occurred in several of the (li(lioing industries.\n\nTo what extent will the displaced worker pr<blem'grow over the next decade? Over the near term, the outlook is f k o r a ~l e since spikes in the variance of interindustry employment tfnd to ocqpr during recessions. If the economic recovery continues though 1985, manufacturing employment, even in the long-run declining Qdustjes, will increase; that is, the cycle effect will ~u t w e i ~h t $ ~ trend effect.. Employment in some.of the declining industrips IS ynlikely, howev.er, to reach peak levels attained in 1979:IV.\n\nOver the longer run, concerns about a growing mismatch between unskilled workers and high skill job requirepents appear to be unfounded. Future business cycle recessions will generate displacement, as occurred during 1980-82, but increased rates of technological change are likely to improve the ability of the economy to absorb the available labor supply.\n\nMoreover, labor supply factors should be highly favorable over the next decade. The percentage of young workers in the labor market will be decreasing as an increasing percentage of the baby boom cohort enters its early career stage. The increasing labor force participation rate is likely, at least, to slow its ascent. Perhaps most important, however, is that the percentage rate of increase of the total labor force will decline sharply. This labor market environment, if it does develop, should make the task of dealing with displaced workers more manageable.\n\nPolicy approaches for displaced workers must be understood in the context of the specific nature of the problem and the outlook for the 1980s. First, there are likely to be fewer displaced workers over the next several years than there are today, but more than there were during the tranquil 1960s. Given the stage of the business cycle and the past record of employment programs, it is too late to mount major new federal initiatives in this area. Secondly, although the displaced worker can be reabsorbed into new employment, the wage loss cannot be undone. Some offset, however, is possible.\n\nLabor market policies that can be used in dealing with the problems posed by worker displacement include special income transfer programs of the type currently in use, the extension of CETA on-thejob training efforts, and employment tax credits or vouchers specifically targeted toward these workers. The degree to which these programs can be relied upon, however, should be strongly influenced by the fact that government policy remedies can efficiently provide only a limited offset to the losses suffered by workers.\n\nThis suggests that employers and labor unions give greater attention to collective bargaining initiatives that would minimize job displacements, even at the tradeoff of real wage objectives. That phenomenon is already apparent in a recession environment, as workers \"give back\" wages in return for improved job security. During an economic upturn, if the threat of displacement remains, continued willingness to trade off gains for increased job security in collective bargaining is needed. In other words, the parties may find it necessary to narrow the wage structure differentials that have emerged during the 1970s.\n\nThe displaced worker phenomenon is difficult to measure, partly because of the lack of consensus as to what is meant by the term \"displaced worker.\" Some appear to use the term interchangeably with individuals who have permanently lost their jobs during the current downturn. However, for analytical purposes, this categorization is not useful since it overlaps with traditional measures of cyclical unemployment.\n\nIn order to focus on structural changes in the labor market, we adopt a definition which confines the problem to forces that affect the equilibrium rather than the cyclical rate of unemployment. Specifically, the term displaced worker is used in this paper to refer to those workers who suffer apermanent loss of their current job in an industry with a negative trend rate of employment growth and for whom a change in jobs will prove costly. Displaced workers are thus people who have made an investment in seniority and job-specific training andlor who have received a union wage premium that,cannot be recovered in the next cyclical upturn by being reemployed in a new job.\n\nSince there is no way of knowing whether any given worker will be rehired in the next upturn, the number of displaced workers can only be measured by adopting some proxy variables that approximate the definitional characteristics. For purposes of this paper, the displaced worker is defined as one who held previous employment with some length of job tenure in a declining industry.'\n\nDeclining industries are those industries that have experienced structural employment declines due to either reduced output levels or reduced manhour requirements at any given level of output. The structural as distinct from cyclical employment decline has been attributed largely to long-term trends in international trade competition and the adoption of labor-saving technologies, in particular those based on microelectronics.\n\nThe length of job tenure criterion is adopted to distinguish between those who have settled into what had promised to be their lifetime or career jobs and those who did not have jobs with much tenure at the time they were discharged. The latter group has made less of an investment in training specific to their previous jobs and are younger on average. As a consequence they can typically change jobs at lower cost to themselves.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has compiled statistics showing the number of displaced workers as of January 1983, based 2. The term can also be defined as involving declining occupations rather than declining industries.\n\non 1982 data. Defining a declining industry as one in which employment levels fell from 1978 to 1980, they found that 1.290 million of the unemployed were from declining industries, and that 280,000 of those workers also had 10 or more years of job t e n ~r e . ~ (See Table 1 .) The industries that contributed the most to the displaced worker population were the automotive, primary metals, textiles, wearing apparel, and lumber industries.\n\nTABLE 1 Estimated Numbers of Dislocated Workers in January 1983 Under Alternative Eligibility Standards and Economic Assumptions (in thousands) Reflecting a broader definition of displaced workers, higher estimates are obtained by the National Council on Employment Policy. The council defined displaced workers as those who (1) were previously employed in stable jobs, (2) had been laid off with little chance of recall, and (3) were unlikely to find new employment using their familiar skills at near their customary rates of pay.4 As in the CBO example, this definition cannot be quantified with-\n\n3. The Congressional Budget Office presented vanous calculations based on different forecasts of the economy between 1980 and January 1983. The numbers in Table 1 are based on the forecast that turnedout to be most relevant to the actual state of the economy in January 1983. Dislocated Workers: Issues and Federal Options, Congressional Budget Office (July 1982). 4. The Displaced Worker in American Society: An Overdue Policy Issue. Nat~onal Counc~l on Employment Policy (February 1983), p. 1.\n\nout adopting proxy measures. The council notes that, \"According to the December 1982 BLS release, of the 12.0 million unemployed, 7.3 million had lost their last job. Only 2.5 million of these considered themselves to be on layoff with expectations of recall by their former employers, and even for many of these the hope will prove illusory. In the broadest sense, if all those who have lost jobs to which they do not expect to be recalled are considered displaced, this would make the number of displaced workers close to 5 m i l l i ~n . \" ~ These estimates are much larger than the CBO estimates because they do not restrict displaced workers by job tenure, or as losing jobs in industriei with a negative long-run employment trend. Rather, the council accepts the workers' assessment of their recall possibilities as indicating displacement. As a consequence, the 5 million number is likely to combine both cyclical and long-run displacement, and includes those who may suffer a considerable wage loss as well as those whose opportunity wage is approximately equal to their last wage.\n\nAs indicated above, we adopt the CBO estimate since their construct is geared to structural rather than cyclical forces. Our interest is in the effect of displacement on structural or equilibrium unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment. Of course, cyclical and structrural problems are interrelated. The displaced worker problem, and structural problems in general, emerge during the recession stage of the business cycle.\n\nRecessions are associated with a speedup in structural changes that are occurring in the economy. High-cost or uncompetitive industries (from an international trade perspective) can prosper when economic activity is strong, but suffer disproportionately when the economy turns downward. That is, periods of high aggregate demand tend to mask longer-run negative trends in firms' product demand. In addition, cyclical excess demand conditions will generate prices that can cover the high cost producers. As demand slackens and product prices decline, it is the highest cost producers who suffer first and foremost. These producers are more likely to close plants or shut down operations during a recession. Thus, although the underlying long-run trend is steadily downward for the declining industries, observed labor demand will stagnate during expansions and ratchet downward during successive periods of weak product prices.\n\nThe underlying labor market mechanism appropriate for displaced workers indicates that the problem is more of a wage than an employment p r ~b l e m . ~\n\nFrom the vantage point of the workers, the jobs that are lost are those in which the workers have invested in specific training, acquired the benefits of seniority, and/or received a wage premium due to unionization. Starting a new job compromises those gains. In addition, whereas seniority is a benefit to workers on established jobs, that age factor is a liability when searching for a new job.\n\nA worker, before being displaced, can be viewed as having a potential flow of wage income shown by the age-earnings profile in Figure 1. The age-earnings profile slopes upward since workers tend to receive higher wages as they age (curve AA'). This can be attributed to a return on specific training and/or a seniority system in which the length of job tenure is itself rewarded. If jobs are unionized and the union succeeds in raising wages, the age-earnings profile can be depicted as BB'.\n\nWorkers who are displaced can, after some time, find a job. In this new job, the workers can be assumed to lose the benefits of unionization, job seniority, and any investments in specific training. The \"opportunity\" wage or the wage on the new job is shown by the curve 0 0 ' . This curve depicts the beginning wage on the new job for displaced workers of different ages. It is shown to decline with age, at least after a certain point in the life cycle. The decline reflects a number of factors ranging from institutional customs or hiring practices to declining skill with age. The older workers, precisely because of their age, find it more difficult and less profitable to invest in new specific training.\n\nThe difference between workers' rising age-earnings profiles (BB') and the declining opportunity wages ( 0 0 ' ) yields the annual wage loss to the displaced workers. That annual loss increases significantly with age. The lifetime as distinct from the annual earnings loss would be the area between the two curves beginning at the time of displacement. Clearly, the oldest workers, although they have the largest annual loss, will not have the largest lifetime earnings loss. That distinction is more likely to befall displaced workers who are in their late forties or early fifties. There is no unique age at which the Earnings 0 L AA' = average earnings profile for the blue collar worker after he retains employment.\n\nBB' = average earnings profile for the union member. 00' = opportunity wage for the d~splaced worker; that is, the wage that they can obtain on a new job in a competitive labor market.\n\nAA' -00' is the annual earnings loss to a nonunion displaced worker.\n\nBB' -00' is the annual earnings loss to a displaced unlon worker.\n\nloss would be a maximum; rather, it would vary with the nature of the industry and occupation and the quantity of specific training. It is this potential, permanent lifetime income lossa loss that is worse for older workers who are too young for early retirementthat is at the heart of the displaced worker problem.\n\nNewly displaced workers are likely to begin their job search looking for jobs that can use their specific training skills and that pay a wage rate comparable to the wage paid on the lost job. Consequently, even in an expanding economy, they are likely to face a lengthy bout of unemployment until their reservation wagethat is, the wage at which they will accept a new job -falls to their opportunity wage. The higher the wage on the lost job, the longer the period of unemployment. For some workers, the earnings replaced by unemployment insurance may be close to the earnings available on the alternative jobs.' 7. Although displacement has been defined in terms of declining industry employment and Empirical studies based on plant closings in the early 1970s support the conclusion that workers permanently displaced, unlike those on temporary layoffs, may suffer substantial losses in earnings for prolonged periods of time. Clearly, however, the size of the earnings loss is much higher for unionized workers in high-wage industries than for workers in low-wage industries. Earnings losses over 25 percent can be found for automobile and steel workers. For those in apparel and textiles, the losses are more likely to be under 10 percent.'\n\nAlthough an analysis of the causes of the ongoing structural change is beyond the scope of this paper, one aspect of the topic is of central concern. In the discussion above, it was argued that the cost of displacement is a function of the difference between individuals' wage rates on their last job and their opportunity wages. To the extent that individuals' wage rates represent a union wage premium, the opportunity wage on new jobs in different firms will be lower by that amount.\n\nWage rates, however, not only play a pivotal role in defining the problem of displacement, they also are crucial as a casual element in explaining the extent to which displacement is likely to take place. Specifically, any job with an increasing wage premium, that is, a wage above the market clearing wage, has a higher risk of displacement than a similarly situated job that pays the equilibrium wage.\n\nlength ofjob tenure, a reglonal d~mension can also be introduced. The declining industry base IS largely in the industrial north central and northeastern states. Since some towns and cities In these regions have a heavy concentration of employment in declining Industries, alternative employment opportunities are Ilmited. As a consequence, job displacement requlres geographical mobillty\n\nThe human capital framework analyzes migration as a type of investment decision, where discounted benefits and costs are equilibrated. The older the worker, the fewer the number of post-migration years in which to gamer the benefits of the geographic move and the greater the fixed investment in the original community in terms of social and psychological relationships. The fact that other family members may still be employed adds another cost dimension to geographical mobility.\n\nFixed investment In specific training, union wage premium, and housing all become obsolete and, like the plants In which they worked, must be simply written off. The policy issue for the truly displaced worker is not how to regain those lost fixed assets but rather how best to make new Investments at a tlme when rema~ning worklife expectancy is short. 8. A summary of these results is presented in Marln (1983).\n\nThe existence of increasing wage premiums in certain industries is shown by increases in the coefficient of variation of average hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing industries. (See TABLE 2 Wage Dispersion in Manufacturing 1947-1982 Coefficient of Coefficient of variation in variation in average hourly earnings Year average hourly earnings 13.36 1965 18.53 14.47 1966 18.47 15.43 1967 17.69 14.96 1968 17.24 15.12 1969 17.33 15.87 1970 17.01 16.41 1971 18.06 16.78 1972 19.12 17.52 1973 19.26 17.16 1974 19.43 17.50 1975 20.44 18.16 1976 21.35 18.77 1977 21.85 18.73 1978 22.32 18.88 1979 22.44 18.87 1980 22.61 19.06 1981 23.59 18.74 1982 24.05\n\nThe coefficient of variation is the variance in the level of average hourly earnings across industries divided by the mean value. Average hourly earnings are obtained from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment and Earnings, various issues.\n\nStudies of the dispersion in wages between high-and low-wage or union and nonunion industries have indicated that the wage structure should vary systematically over the business cycle.9 In particular, the wage setting process in high-wage or unionized industries responds to market conditions with a longer time lag than does wage setting in 9. See, for example, Wachter (1970). low-wage industries. This longer lag means that the time series of wage changes in high wage industries should tend to be relatively acyclical. With their relatively fixed profile of wage increases, the high-wage industries should experience an increased wage premium during downturns in business activity, but give back those gains during the subsequent upswing.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, the empirical evidence on the cyclical behavior of wage differentials supported this theory. High wage premiums, after growing through most of the 1950s, tended to decline during the 1960s. Again, as anticipated, wage premiums grew during the high unemployment years of 1970 and 197 1.\n\nThe breakdown in the cyclical behavior of the interindustry wage structure began during the expansion of the early 1970s. Whereas wage gains in the low-wage industries were predicted, by the theory, to be higher than in the high-wage or unionized industries, the reverse occurred. The coefficient of variation in wages among industries continued to grow, reflecting the large wage gains in the already high-wage industries. This development has been associated with the spread of COLA clauses in collective bargaining contracts. Before adoption of these clauses, unanticipated high inflation rates caused union wage increases to lag nonunion increases. With these clauses in effect, union wages responded more quickly to the higher inflation rates. The percentage of workers under major collective bargaining agreements with COLA coverage jumped from 27.8 percent in 1972 to 6 1 .2 percent in 1977. lo\n\nThe impact of COLA clauses on relative wages was heightened by two unanticipated factors. The first was that a large component of the inflation increases during the 1970s was caused by supply shocks. This was unlike the inflation of the 1960s, which emanated from domestic excess demand conditions and thus caused nonunion wages to increase by the same amount. During the 1970s, nonunion wages trailed behind the inflation rate as real wages declined. Since the COLA clauses did not differentiate between external supply and domestic demand inflation processes, the unionized workers were equally protected against both contingencies. The result was that 10. Wachter and Wachter (1978)  inflation resulting from supply shocks caused the interindustry wage dispersion to increase.\n\nThe second factor was that the CPI-W, the primary index in COLA clauses, overstated the inflation rate. Although the problems created by the CPI formula in use during the 1970s are well known and are not repeated here, the flaws in the CPI-W provided an overkill in cost-of-living protection. To see the magnitude of the problem, we have worked out an example in which the personal consumption deflator (PCE) is used as a true measure of the cost of living. The coverage rate most frequently found in COLA clauses provides for an increase of 1 cent for every 0.3 rise in the index. Between 1973 and1982, the CPI-W increased by 155.5 points, from 133.1 to 288.6. If, on the other hand, the CPI-W had only increased as rapidly as the PCE during that period, then it would have only reached 268.2 by 1982. The difference in annual wage levels is $1,414.\" That represents an increase of more than 20 percent based on 1973 wage levels and an increase of slightly under 10 percent based on 1982 wages.\n\nAlthough the COLA overkill could account for much of the puzzling increase in the wage dispersion among industries, we cannot explain why firms did not offset COLA increases by granting lower straight wage adjustments. Institutional and industry-specific factors and information lags probably explain some of the inability of firms to adjust relative wages. One example is the steel industry's experimental no-strike agreement.\n\nIt is likely that the increased wage dispersion was one factor which caused the job displacement problem. Employment displacement effects caused by high relative wages should be traced out by a downward movement along the industries' demand curve for labor as well as by an inward shift of the curve.\n\nTo examine the potential magnitude of the problem, we estimated a cross-sectional relationship between the relative wage performance and relative employment change of 45 two-digit industries between 11. Using the CPI-W measure, model COLA provisions accounted for a $5.18 Increase In hourly wages. Had the PCE been used instead, the increase would have been $4.50. The difference is $0.68. The annual difference given in the text is based on a figure of 2,080 hours per year. In addition, all of these calculations are for straight-time pay. Fringe benefits that are determined by straight-time salaries would increase by the same rate.\n\n1973 and 1982. The results are the following:\n\nThe equation was estimated in log linear form and included all of the two-digit industries for which data were available. The dependent variable is the relative employment change between those two years for each industry, while the independent variables are the relative output, relative price, and relative wage changes for the respective industries.\n\nThe results indicate that relative employment responded negatively to relative wage increases with an elasticity of 0.57. The wage elasticity is computed holding relative output constant and so represents an own wage substitution effect. Since the wage variable measures the percent change in wages in excess of the average for the private economy, it is not surprising that the elasticity is fairly high.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the industries used in the CBO calculations as the home base for the most displaced workers did have increasing relative wages over the 1973 to 1982 time period. Wages in the lumber industry, for example, increased at a 0.72 annual percentage rate, faster than for the overall economy between 1973 and 1982. The comparable figure for primary metals is a 1.59 annual percentage growth in the wage premium, and for motor vehicles it is a 0.97 annual percentage growth premium. Since the textile industry increased its wages at an annual percentage rate of only 0.17 faster than the overall economy, it can be viewed as somewhat of an exception.\n\nRelative wage levels, of course, are only part of the story, a point which is illustrated by the predicament of the textile industry. Moreover, the rising value of the dollar has had a larger quantitative effect on the American wage level relative to its trading partners than domestic relative wage changes. In fact, real wage growth in the United States has been below that of other OECD countries.\n\nIn terms of comparative advantage, however, those domestic industries with increasing relative wages will always be more vulnerable than will those with declining relative wages. Economy-wide negative output effects associated with the rising value of the dollar, on the other hand, are likely to be self-limiting and will be dominated by increasing scale effects in the expansion phase of the business cycle. The point concerning increasing industry-specific relative wages is that that effect is permanent and not self-limiting without corrective measures on the part of the industry wage-setting mechanism.\n\nIn order to estimate the total employment displacement effect in manufacturing due to rising relative wages, it is necessary to have an estimate of the wage elasticity for employment that includes the scale efect. Unfortunately for our purposes, most existing econometric estimates of the demand curve for labor on the industry level measure only the substitution effect; that is, output is used as an independent variable along with the various factor input prices. The literature suggests an elasticity of approximately 0.30 for this substitution effect, holding output constant.12\n\nThe data show that of 21 manufacturing industries, 17 increased their wages for production and other nonsupervisory personnel relative to those wages paid elsewhere in the (private, nonagricultural) economy. If we assume that the elasticity of 0.3 is correct, then it is possible to compute the employment loss due to the increase in relative wages for those industries with high relative wages. The decline in manhours is shown in Table 3, column 3.\n\nEmployment elasticities with respect to wages, not holding output constant, are likely to be considerably higher (in absolute value) than the numbers reported in Table 3, column 3. For example, in competitive industries, wage elasticities can be close to infinite if the higher wage causes those firms to have higher costs than other firms in the industry. Calculating these elasticities with respect to internationally traded goods is particularly difficult because of the need to have accurate price information for foreign competitors. An attempt at estimating these wage elasticities is beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover, there is surprisingly little in the way of an academic literature to draw upon. l 3\n\nIn columns 4 and 5 , we provide disemployment effects based on wage elasticities of employment of 0.6 and 1.0, respectively. An elasticity of 1 .O, when output is not held constant, would seem to be quite reasonable. In this latter case, one finds that a high percentage of the displacement effect can be attributed to rising relative wages.\n\n12. See, for example, Hamermesh (1976,1983) and Clark and Freeman (1980).\n\n13. An exception is the recent study by Grossman (1982). He calculates employment elasticities with respect to import prices for nine ~ndustries.  In lumber, for example, if the wage elasticity is 1 .O, 22 percent of the manhours decline between 1973 and 1982 would be due to rising relative wages. For primary metals, the corresponding figure would be 40 percent, and for motor vehicles it would be 24 percent. For textiles, on the other hand, only 5 percent of the employment loss would be explained by wage effects (given an elasticity of 1.0). The above figures are in terms of manhours. It is interesting to convert those numbers into employment. Suppose that the average fulltime worker has a 35-hour week for 50 weeks per year. Dividing the total manhour loss in the above four industries by 1,750 yields a job or employment loss of 396,829. This is quite close to the total number of displaced workers in those industries estimated by the CBO. Although the calculations reported here are quite rough, the order of magnitudes would probably not be greatly affected by alternative calculation schemes.14 Relative wage increases in manufacturing have the potential to explain an important component of the displaced worker phenomenon.\n\nThe public debate with respect to worker displacement addresses future as well as current concerns. To what extent is this problem likely to be a continuing difficulty that contributes to an ongoing mismatch between the available workers and the available jobs and, thus, to an increase in the economy's equilibrium unemployment rate?\n\nTwo aspects of this problem need to be considered. The first concerns the near-term outlook for displaced workers as the economy recovers. The second concerns the degree of job displacement that is likely to occur, on average, over the next decade.\n\nWe argue that the count of displaced workers is likely to be considerably lower in the future than it is todaythat is, the number of newly displaced workers should be lower than the number absorbed into employment. Although displaced workers stay unemployed longer than the average unemployed worker, they eventually do find new jobs. Studies of past plant closings suggest that the 50-year-old 14. For example, using a 40-hour week for 52 weeks yields an employment loss of 333.871.\n\nwill be unemployed twice as long as the 25-year-old.''\n\nThe displaced worker phenomenon is a byproduct of divergent employment growth across industries. This interindustry employment variance tends to be particularly high during recessions. Table 4 depicts the variance of employment (or manhour) changes across industries over time.\n\nThe data highlight three related facts. First, divergent interindustry employment behavior has been associated with the downside of the business cycle. Spikes in employment instability occurred in 1973-1975, 1980, and 1982. Secondly, reflecting the different cyclical episodes, interindustry employment variance was higher in the 1970s than during the 1960s. (The 1950s also had periods of divergent employment growth, especially around the Korean War and the recession of 1958.)16 Thirdly, the lower employment variance during recoveries indicates that at least some of the industries with declining manhours during the downturn do not catch up by registering unusually large gains during the subsequent upswing.\n\nTo test whether the seeds of this historical pattern can be found in current data, we estimated a series of reduced form industry manhours equations and projected manhours through the next recovery. The equations were constructed so as to contain aggregate output and unemployment, industry trends, and autocorrelated components. The dependent variables were the log level of manhours for each of the two-digit manufacturing industries. The exogenous variables were limited to those for which forecasts through 1985 were available from a range of econometric models. The equation form chosen contained a time trend, two lagged dependent variables, and current and two lagged values of both aggregate output and a cyclical unemployment measure adjusted for demographic changes.\" The forecast for aggregate unemployment and output was from Wharton Econometrics. Details are presented in the appendix.\n\nPushed by a projected overall economic recovery, manufacturing labor demand should rise strongly between 1982:IV and 1985:IV.\n\n15. See, for example, Gordus, Jarley, and Ferman (1981). and Lipsky (1970). 16. Sectoral shifts as a cause of unemployment were explored by Lilien (1982). Based on an increase in \"job losers and leavers\" for any given level of aggregate demand, he argued that a significant portion of unemployment that had been labeled cyclical should be reclassified as noncyclical.\n\n17. Several forms of the equation were estimated. Although specific industry forecasts differed in a few cases, projections of total manhours were not sensitive (at the level of accuracy that we used) to the individual equation specification. For the projections, the same equation was used for each industry.\n\nTABLE 4 Variance in Interindustry Employment Changes Two-Digit Manufacturing Industries 1950 to 1982 Year Employment Manhours 27.96 47.91 195 44.42 66.79 20.55 20.11 25.53 30.30 21.74 27.72 17.31 30.81 15.81 24.69 8.26 8.71 27.24 35.60 16.33 25.72 6.46 7.78 9.92 12.55 9.42 18.47 5.59 6.42 4.01 5.67 12.38 19.01 17.13 19.74 8.24 10.25 6.24 13.02 5.65 7.92 12.00 17.11 15.26 20.71 11.06 15.38 1973 17.24 23.37 1974 12.93 19.67 17.63 19.42 1976 8.36 17.63 16.64 20.07 1978 6.65 7.10 1979 8.30 11.29 1980 25.82 31.18 6.68 11.66 17.74 25.43 Calculations represent the variance in the quarterly rate of change across industries. Data are from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment and Earnings, various issues.\n\nManhours are projected to increase from 37.0 billion to 41.2 billion.\n\nBecause our simulation begins at the recession trough, 1982:IV, and contains lagged dependent variables, the values in Table 5 should be viewed as conservative estimates of manhours for a recovery lasting through 1985. Since the economy is not projected to be at its potential output and/or equilibrium unemployment rate level as of 1985:IV, further cyclical recovery is possible. This, however, is not a guaranteed result for all industries since the negative trend offsets the declining (although still positive) aggregate output growth rate for some industries even before 1985:IV. Manufacturing manhours, although exceeding 1982:IV levels, are not expected to recover back to 1979:IV peak levels by 1985:IV. Although all industries are expected to have higher manhour levels in 1985:IV, compared with trough readings in 1982:IV, the degree of recovery varies widely. Strong employment gains are forecast for electrical machinery and instruments in the durable goods sector and for printing and petroleum in nondurable goods. For these industries, manhours in 1985:IV are far beyond the 1979:IV levels. The weakest recoveries are projected for primary metals; textiles; stone, clay, and glass; machinery; leather; and lumber. Hence, the declining industries are projected to maintain their long-run decline.\n\nThe calculations in Table 5 support the contention that the magnitude of the displaced worker problem is likely to lessen over the next several years. Economic recovery, as currently projected, will make a large dent in the problem. Although manufacturing will not regain prior levels, this reflects only a slight worsening of trends already underway for most of the past decade. As shown in Table 6, employment growth in manufacturing had largely ceased by 1970. Although economy-wide employment growth throughout the 1970s was more rapid than it had been during the 1960s, the new jobs were very heavily concentrated in services, wholesale and retail trade, and state and local government. '' 18. The shifting pattern of employment by industry also masks greater stability in the skill distribution of the population. Individuals with the education and skill levels that would have led to employment as operatives in the 1950s are becoming service workers or clerical workers in the 1980s. Thus a tilt in the distribution of employment across skill categories, as would be implied if the long-run mismatch story were to hold, is not apparent in the data.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment by industry and occupations projections to 1990 are based on extrapolations of current levels and observable trends. Although they do project that the highestpercentage growth occupations will be in some computer-based fields, the total\n\nTABLE 5 Industry Manhours Simulations Trough-Based Scenario (millions) Industry 1979:IV 1982:IV Manufacturing 43,743.16 37,008.00 Durable goods 26,819.07 21,633.82 Lumber 1,538.49 1,23 1.73 Furniture and Fixtures 996.00 849.97 Stone, clay, and glass 1,511.34 1,166.25 Primary metals 2,632.14 1,650.28 Fabricated metals 3,613.53 2,779.17 Machinery 5,338.96 4,317.33 Electrical machinery 4,500.21 4,016.60 Transportation equipment Motor vehicles Instruments Miscellaneous Nondurable goods Food Tobacco Textiles Apparel Paper products Printing and publishing Chemicals Petroleum Rubber Leather Values for 1979:IV and 1982:IV are actual manhours on an annual basis for each quarter.

The percentage of the change in employment between 1970 and 1981 that is accounted for by each industry.\n\nSome researchers have argued that the number of displaced workers will grow dramatically over the remainder of this decade due to technological innovations. For example, recent studies argue that the introduction of microelectronic (high-tech) technologies could cause a job loss of 3 million during the 1980s and up to 7 million by the year number involved is quite small. Examples are data processing machine mechanics, computer system analysts, and computer operators. In addition, certain low skilled occupations and labor-intensive industries are also expected to grow rapidly. Examples are food preparation and service workers, chlld care attendants, and nurses' aides and orderlies. These latter projections clearly reflect employment growth due to the hlgh income elasticities of those fields. Whereas data processing machine mechanics will grow rapidly due to technological innovations, nurses' aides and orderlies will grow rapidly because society will be wealthier.\n\nThe results for the broadly defined occupational groups support these conclusions. The fastest growth sector is likely to remain the service sector with total growth to 1990 of 31.4 percent. Support for the contention that the shift out of traditional blue collar work will continue is also found in the BLS projections, as those occupations are projected to grow only by 18.6 percent.\n\nDeta~led occupational projections can be found in Carey (1982).\n\n2000.19 The latter figure would mean a loss of one-third of the manufacturing jobs currently in existence. These numbers have been used by some researchers to reach the pessimistic conclusion that job growth in low-skilled, blue collar (and, perhaps, white collar) employment will be insufficient over the next decade to match the increased numbers of workers needing jobs. In the worst case, the mismatch could cause ongoing problems of technological-based job displacement for already employed older workers.\n\nOur argument is that the mismatch scenario is a very low probability event.\n\nOur contention with the mismatch scenario is basic and concerns the application of the economic model of technological change. The mismatch view is based on a partial rather than a general equilibrium view of the economy. Several issues are crucial here. First, is technological change labor saving, labor using, or neutral? Second, in each case, how will technological change affect aggregate employment and wages?\n\nTo address these issues, it is useful to refer to a simple model of technological change.\" Assume a general neoclassical production function of the form where 0 is output, K is the capital input, L is the labor input, and t is a time index. In per capita terms, this is q = f(k; t).\n\n(3)\n\nUnder the usual efficiency conditions with output as the numeraire, the real wage rate and rental rate are\n\nThe direct effect of technological change is that fewer inputs than had previously been the case are needed to produce a given output quan- tity. However, technological change may result in a substitution effect among the inputs of production that alters relative usage andlor factor prices. Technological change is considered to be neutral if, and only if, the relative shares remain constant; is labor saving if the relative share of labor falls; and is labor using if the relative share of labor rises.\n\nThe definition of technological change used here is in terms of a constant capital-output ratio. If the relative shares remain constant, then technological change is referred to as Harrod neutral.\n\nIn Figure 2, the production function shifts between time to and tl, while the capital-output ratio remains constant. Capital's share must also remain constant for the technological change to be neutral. Since Wq is a constant, this implies that the profit rate, r = fk, must also be constant.\n\nTo see what this implies for wages, we need only examine the relative share equation ( 6). Since K increases and r is constant, labor income, wL, must increase in order for the relative shares to remain constant. If employment remains constant, then the real wage rate will increase. In particular, so that w increases linearly with k at a rate of fk(SL/SK).\n\nIf the profit rate, fk, were increased after the technological change, then the technological change would be designated as labor saving. It is this latter case that researchers seem to fear with respect to the microelectronic technology.\n\nIn Figure 3, the production function shifts so that at the constant capital-output ratio, the slope, fk, is greater at tl than at to. This means that capital's share, SK, is now greater and the relative share\n\nLabor Saving Technological Change of labor has fallen. Although labor's share declines when technological change is labor-saving, the real wage rate may still increase. In (8), all three left-hand terms have now changed. SL/SK is lower, but k and fk are now higher. The result is that the change in the wage rate is indeterminate. Only if the new technology were extremely labor-saving would the real wage rate actually decrease. In less extreme cases, the real wage would simply grow less rapidly than output, and labor's share of national income would decrease.\n\nLabor-saving technological change also need not imply an increase in the unemployment rate. In the disequilibrium short run, of course, frictional unemployment may result as workers search for new jobs. Over time, the extent of unemployment reflects the downward rigidity of real wages. Since real wages decline only when technical change is extremely labor-saving, the downward rigidity issue is moot.\n\nOutside the single good model, the aggregate impact of (labor-saving) technological change becomes more complex. For example, in a two-sector model, the sector in which the technological change occurs determines the effects on the real wages and on labor's share of total income. If the seemingly labor-saving technological change (in terms of the parameters of the sector's production function) occurred in the labor-intensive sector, the price decline in that sector would yield a shift in consumption that would favor the labor-intensive sector. The result could be actually to increase the demand for labor and, hence, labor's share. In addition, given that income elasticities tend to be higher for labor-intensive products, output effects are likely to work against any adverse real wage effects of labor-saving technological change.\n\nIn a model with more than two sectors, the general equilibrium effects of technological change in one sector become even less obvious. Basically, the partial equilibrium observation that a technological change is labor-saving in one sector is not sufficient to argue that it will be labor-saving in the aggregate.\n\nThe above discussion highlights the difficulties in assessing the effects of the current wave of microelectronic-based technological change (or any type of technological change), even when one can determine that the change is labor-saving in the affected sector. More problematical, however, is the original assumption that the technical change is labor-saving. The critical issue here is to determine the boundaries of the industry that has experienced a shift in its production function.\n\nAt an aggregate level, there seems little reason to fear the laborsaving scenario. Historically, broad classes of technological change, once the output effect is considered, have been neutral, tilting toward neither labor nor capital in their net effect. To the extent that the current type of technological change does not mark a sharp break with the recent past, the behavior of labor's share for the past 15 years should allay concerns that the underlying process of technological change is labor-saving.\n\nA final observation on the potential for a future mismatch problem involves changes in the growth rate of the labor force over the next decade. Since displaced workers may be viewed as structurally unemployed, their degree of labor market difficulty will be strongly affected by changes in actual and equilibrium employment rates. , A strongly positive factor with respect to excess demand conditions in low-wage labor markets over the next decade will be a decline in the rate of overall labor force growth. Whereas the labor force grew at slightly over 2.2 percent per year between 1970 and 1982, it will grow at only 1.5 percent between 1983 and 1990. This drop in the rate of growth of the labor force means that 6.85 million fewer workers will be entering the labor market than would have been the case if the old labor force growth rate were in effect.\n\nIn addition, since labor force growth rates are closely tied to the size of the 16to 24-year-old population group, the change in the composition of the labor force will be a shift away from younger workers. The result will be excess demand conditions that favor youth and related unskilled labor markets and an associated increase in the relative wages of these workers. The demographic labor supply effects, tilting the labor force heavily toward job-stable older workers and away from youth workers, and the slower increase in the rate of growth in the labor force, should contribute to a decline in the equilibrium unemployment rate.\n\nThe decrease in the equilibrium rate of unemployment and the associated relative improvement in excess demand conditions in unskilled labor markets will improve the fate of displaced workers. They will find jobs more quickly and at higher wages than would have been true during the depressed low-skilled labor markets of the 1970s.\n\nWe conclude that the displaced worker problem is not so bleak as is generally believed. Although technological change may result in short-run displacement of some workers, it is also associated with periods of high economic growth. Income effects associated with an expanding economy should ease employment problems of displaced workers. In addition, the labor market in which displaced workers are likely to search for new jobs will improve during the 1980s due to a decline in labor force growth. Workers operating in these markets will experience better employment opportunities than displaced workers have in the recent past.\n\nThe potential problem area identified in this paper concerns interindustry relative wage differentials. The recovery in manufacturing employment is likely to be strongly affected by the future course of relative wages.\n\nThere are three broadly defined policy approaches to the problems posed by displaced workers.\" The current policy is to use \"special protection programs\" to provide transfer payments that are more generous to displaced workers than those received by other unemployed workers. That policy approach has been criticized because, by providing supplementary benefits, it discourages workers from finding new jobs. It also does not provide the training that could better equip displaced workers for new jobs.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to make use of training programs, either by including displaced workers in the CETA-eligible population or by instituting new training programs. Currently, some of the special protection programs include provisions for training, but these are rarely utilized. The third approach would be to use vouchers or employment tax credits to make displaced workers more attractive to new employers. Employers would receive cash directly or would be able to deduct a percentage of salaries paid to eligible workers from their tax liability.\n\nThe special protection programs are specifically designed to provide supplemental aid to displaced workers when government-initiated action causes loss of seniority and firm-specific human capital through unemployment. Rather than having only one umbrella policy, numerous disjointed programs exist, each targeted at separate worker or interest groups. The best known special protection program is Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n\nTAA is an open-ended program targeted toward workers in industries that are designated as P adversely impacted by import competition. Transfer payments (in the form of an extension of UI benefits), training, and relocation benefits are available. To date, only the transfer payments have been widely\n\nBecause of its large and expanding size, TAA has come under increasing scrutiny. The novel conceptual feature of TAA is that it is 21. Parts of this section are drawn from Wachter (1983). 22. For an excellent study of special protection programs, see Martin (1983). designed to compensate affected workers not only for their earnings losses (which are covered by UI) but also for their loss of seniority and other job-related rights that result from government-initiated actions, including free trade. Currently, workers judged eligible for the TAA program continue to receive benefits equal to unemployment insurance after the UI benefits (UI and TAA) have been received for 52 weeks. Twenty-six additional weeks of benefits are available for those workers participating in training programs . 23 This approach, however, has three serious flaws.\n\nFirst, at the time that workers are dismissed, the workers, the policymakers, even the firms do not know which workers might eventually be recalled and which are, in fact, permanently displaced. Thus, from an economic vantage point, the unemployment and related income loss of those who eventually regain their jobs are difficult to distinguish from other temporary bouts of cyclical unemployment.\n\nFor workers who are judged eligible for TAA and are eventually recalled to their previous jobs, TAA acts as income maintenance that extends the unemployment insurance benefits normally received by unemployed workers.24 Since studies of unemployment insurance have provided evidence that increased UI benefits increase the optimal duration of unemployment, the effect of TAA on temporarily displaced workers will be to increase unemployment rather than to provide incentives to find new empl~yment.~' Secondly, Trade Adjustment Assistance does not distinguish among workers with respect to their tenure on the job. As noted earlier, the primary problem for displaced workers is a loss of wages due to a loss of seniority, job-specific skills, andlor a union wage premium rather than a loss of employment. Displaced workers are likely to find employment at lower wages in other sectors of the economy.\n\n23. Amendments to the TAA program were enacted in August 1981. The amendments reduced the amount of benefits received and altered TAA to be an extension of UI benefits rather than a supplement to UI. In addition, TAA offers search and relocation benefits to workers looking for new jobs. Search benefits offer a maximum of $600 with workers paying I0 percent of their total searchcosts. Relocation benefits have nomonetary limit. Workers pay 10 percent of relocation costs and receive a \"settling-in\" grant of up to $600. 24. One of the early criticisms of TAA was that the administrative task of determin~ng eliglbility took so long that many workers had been recalled by the time they received their first benefit payment. Our argument is that such workers should not have been elig~ble for TAA at all if the program had been aimed at permanently displaced workers. 25. For areview of theunemployment insurance literature, see Welch (1977). According to Welch, there is no evidence that increased unemployment insurance benefits Lead to improved new employment oppoitunities.\n\nFor younger workers, this does not present a severe loss due to their junior status in their previous job as well as their longer expected working life at the new job. As a consequence, relatively junior workers who have not made large investments in specific training andlor seniority are being compensated for a loss that they have not actually incurred.\n\nThirdly, the distinction between unemployment caused by government policy, generally interpreted, and other types of unemployment is difficult to make. Although some types of unemployment may be a very specific result of some specific government policy, most if not all unemployment can be viewed as being affected, to some extent, by general government policies. It becomes a question of political clout as to which workers are labeled eligible for TAA benefits. The special protection program approach thus serves to construct artificial distinctions among unemployed workers and to pay extended benefits to certain groups that have no greater claim on those resources than other unemployed workers.\n\nSome of these problems could, at least conceptually, be resolved, while others are inherent in the concept of special protection. For example, a minimum length of tenure could be written directly into the eligibility criteria. This would resolve the problem of paying extra benefits to junior employees. In fact, as has been done for disadvantaged workers, programs could be targeted to certain groups of workers according to predetermined traits. Other issues, such as the categorization of some workers as unemployed because of government-initiated action, are unresolvable. This problem could be lessened if benefits were made available to tenured workers in declining industries rather than to workers displaced by government action. A battle would still take place over defining the parameters of the tenured workers in a declining industry, but the criteria could then be applied evenly to all workers.\n\nIn fact, TAA did fortuitously identify the major declining industries (see Table 7). The major beneficiaries of TAA have been workers in the automobile industry, accounting for 58 percent of the total recipients and 72 percent of the benefits between 1975 and 1981.\n\nSteel and apparel have also had a large number of workers eligible for TAA.\n\nAlthough reaching the right industries, TAA did not distinguish between displaced workers and those on temporary layoff. After prior recessions, most TAA recipients were recalled by their old\n\nTABLE 7 Trade Adjustment Assistance Outlays by Industry Benefits Industry Workers (millions of dollars) Auto 685,113 $2,217.1 Steel 137,319 350.6 Apparel 150,593 189.7 Footwear 76,176 92.2 Electronics 60,387 90.1 Fabricated metals 29,899 74.0 Textiles 26,075 44.0 Coal 7,355 17.7 $3,075.4 firms.\n\nThe alternative is simply to fold the transfer payment provisions of these programs into the UI system. In that way, all unemployed workers would have their benefits calculated according to the same formula. This, of course, leaves unresolved the question of the degree of impact of UI benefits on the duration of unemployment. It does, however, make the problem equally sticky for all unemployed workers eligible for UI.\n\nProviding training, as distinct from transfers, for displaced workers does not have the above limitations. If a group of workers indicates a willingness to be retrained in place of receiving supplementary unemployment benefits, then there is a presumption that they are indeed displaced and not simply on temporary layoff. Indeed, the notion of retraining for displaced workers is currently popular. One policy recommendation is to make existing training programs available to them. Many of the displaced workzrs would not be currently eligible for programs targeted toward disadvantaged workers, because their past wages and family income would be too high.\n\nTo what extent, however, can existing programs that were designed for disadvantaged workers deal with the unique problems posed by displaced workers? The impact of current training programs on the earnings of program participants (largely disadvantaged work-ers) yields the following conclusions: (a) they increase the earnings of program participants, but accomplish this by increasing hours of work more than wages; (b) they train workers with marginal labor market and job attachment to hold relatively low skilled jobs; (c) they have relatively limited effect on improving job skills other than those gained through work e~perience.'~\n\nThe displaced workers, however, are quite different from disadvantaged workers. In particular, displaced workers have an established work history marked by a strong job attachment and the proven ability to learn (at least certain types of) job skills. A greater percentage of them have a high school diploma or better (66.2 percent), and a smaller percentage are from the minority population than is true for the low-income family. (See Table 8.) The major differences, however, involve the considerably higher economic status of displaced workers in the year prior to being displaced. One-quarter of them came from families with income of at least $15,000, one-half were covered by employer pension plans, and more than half had one or more other family members employed.\n\nThe problem of most displaced workers is neither too few hours of work nor marginal skills; rather, it is that their previous job paid a high wage relative to the opportunity wage that they face on alternative employment. On this basis there is reason for skepticism as to the potential success of extending coverage of existing training programs.\n\nThe one possible exception to this is on-the-job training. This program can be administered as a type of voucher or employment tax credit system targeted toward displaced workers. That is, the government compensates employers directly for extra training costs associated with specially targeted workers (i.e., those eligible for the program).\n\nThe virtues of using vouchers andlor employment tax credits are several. First, they can be targeted toward the group that the government decides to aid. For example, the government could avoid extra compensation for those on temporary layoffs in declining industries (as is currently done in TAA) by using the multiple criteria listed in Table 1. In addition, only those displaced from jobs on which they TABLE 8 Characteristics of Displaced versus Disadvantaged Workers Displaced Low-income worker* family t Percent with a high school diploma or better 66.2 55.9 Percent minority 30.6 42.7 Percent female 35.0 37.2 Percent with pension plan coverage in at least one job held during past year Percent with family income $15,000 + in last year 24.5 0.2 Percent in family with one or more additional workers 55.8 29.2 Source: Marc Bendick, Jr., and Judith Radlinski Devine, \"Workers Dislocated by Economic Change: Do They Need Federal Employment and Training Assistance,\" Seventh Annual Report of the National Commission for Employment Policy (Washington, D.C.: National Commission for Employment Policy, 1981), pp. 175-226. * Workers from industries in which employment change was negative between 1978 and 1980\n\nand who were unemployed for more than eight weeks.

This is particularly useful since many of the displaced workers are readily trainable in production level skill jobs, while others may have been unskilled laborers. The former group can be readily integrated into new jobs without remedial off-the-job training.\n\nThirdly, the placement function, matching employers and workers, could be performed. This component would only apply, however, if the current training format were retained. In this case government counselors would influence the new career path followed by the displaced workers. With a voucher system, unless modified to introduce counseling, the workers themselves would determine the path, limited only by the value of their particular voucher.*'\n\nQuestions have been raised as to whether employers would participate actively in employment tax credit or voucher systems. Some argue that government paperwork and the stigma associated with workers who need government assistance would dissuade employers from hiring those workers. However, the results from the use of employer tax credits, both in this country and abroad, are reasonable and promising. Ultimately, the success of the programs depends upon the size of the financial incentives provided to companies that participate in the program.\n\nWhereas replacing lost wage rates would be very difficult, finding new employment for displaced workers in an expanding economy would be manageable. Since this would require only retooling and placement, on-the-job training could facilitate the training process. The purpose of the program, however, is not to increase long-run employment; rather, it is to reduce the time spent unemployed and to increase the wage rate of workers in their new jobs. With this in mind, the current on-the-job training program would have to be restructured to be better adapted to older workers with an established work history.\"\n\nThe three approaches above share the assumption that the displaced worker phenomenon represents a distinguishable labor market policy problem. The fundamental question concerning the displaced worker issue is what are the damages suffered by these workers that should be viewed as compensable.\n\nFor example, suppose that the displaced workers had enjoyed a wage premium resulting from collective bargaining agreements. Making the workers whole could be interpreted as providing them with a voucher or employment tax credit of sufficient value so that 27. Conceptually, these types of programs act as wage subsidies, driving a wedge between the wages received by the workers and the unit labor costs borne by the employers. By enabling workers to receive a higher wage during an initial training period than dictated by skill or productivity considerations, the subsidy generates posltlve work incentives. For firms, the subsidy functions as a decrease in the wage rate. Empirical data on employment functions indicate an own wage elasticity greater than one; that is, firms increase employment by more than I percent for every percent decrease in the wage rate.\n\n28. New initiatives wlth respect to employment tax credits or vouchers would not be suited to the problem if it were decided that displaced workers should not be given special programs to compensate them for job losses. Rather, they would need to make use of programs generally available to all unemployed workers regardless of the presumed cause of their unemployment. In addition, attention would need to be given to the problems posed by the hlgher fringe benefit costs that are frequently associated with older workers. This topic is beyond the scope of thls paper.\n\nthey could eventually earn, as a return on their skills, the wage premium paid on their lost jobs.\n\nThere is, of course, the question as to whether any combination of vouchers or on-the-job training could be successful enough to fully compensate workers. The evidence on earnings gains from training, as indicated above, suggests that the gains are relatively small and largely occur through increased hours of work at relatively low skilled wage rates.\n\nEven if the extra training could be accomplished, there is still the question as to whether it should be attempted. Suppose, for example, that the union wage on the lost job did, in fact, represent a wage above that dictated by competitive labor market forces. Based on a collective bargaining agreement with the past employer, the displaced unionized workers were receiving a higher wage than similarly skilled workers in nonunion firms. Although the government might want to assist the displaced workers in finding jobs at the competitive wage earned by most other workers, funding extra training to support the wage premium itself would be more difficult to justify.\n\nSome researchers have argued that the union wage premium is actually a compensating differential for the fact that the unionized jobs are in those sectors where employment is particularly sensitive to cyclical layoffs or employment uncertainty in general. In this sense, the observed high wage is not precisely a wage premium; rather, it is a compensating wage differential for the higher risks of unemployment. If this were the case, the employment loss from the high variance employment industry would reflect the realization of a relatively high probability event (compared, for example, to being displaced from a job in the finance sector). The placement of a displaced worker in a new jobin a lower employment variance industrycould be made at the competitive, nonunion wage since the compensating risk differential would no longer be required.\n\nA separate but even more intractable issue is posed by the notion that the government should consider some mechanism for compensating displaced workers for their lost investment in job-specific training. For example, if the government were to treat human and physical capital symmetrically, the loss of a human capital investment could yield an income tax write-off for its owner. The difficulty is that that type of training is inherently unquantifiable. Attempting even a rough estimate of its monetary value would be too speculative to serve as a guide for policymakers. Thus, one can argue that the displaced workers' loss of a wage premium should be noncompensable from a societal perspective. What government policy could still accomplish is a reduction in the transition costs associated with finding a new job. That is, the government would attempt to restore a jbb at the competitive or prevailing labor market wage for workers with similar, broadly defined skill levels.\n\nThe degree to which the displaced worker's job and income loss are compensable is directly related to the question of the degree to which the displaced worker problem is different from that of the average unemployed worker. If it is decided that for either conceptual or practical reasons there is no difference, then the current array of policy programs, to the extent that each displaced worker is eligible, would be the correct policy approach.\n\nA final policy option would be to view the problem as essentially a private-sector problem. Suppose, for example, one concludes that displaced workers are a separate category of unemployed workers but that their uniqueness is tied to the wage loss they suffer when displaced. In this case, one might be forced to rely on private-sector parties to restructure the employment relationship so as to slow the rate at which workers are displaced.\n\nIn particular, job securitythat is, the protection of job-specific investments and wage premiumsis more fully an employeremployee problem that requires a private-sector solution. Extra attention must be given to avoiding the job loss in the first place. Where workers are unionized, they can bargain collectively with employers with respect to job protection. For example, labor unions could trade off some of their wage premium for greater worker job security.\n\nThe recent pattern of give-backs is a reflection of increased concern over job security. Give-backs have occurred in industries under considerable product market pressure emanating either from international trade competition (e.g., autos and steel) or nonunion sectors in newly deregulated industries (e.g., trucking and airlines). Most of the declining industries have been involved in the give-backs as well as several industries with stagnant employment that might be future candidates for the declining industry classification.\n\nAlthough it is widely believed that these give-backs will be terminated once the economy recovers, some are written into contracts lasting for three or more years. As a consequence, although the givebacks may not be repeated, in these industries the new wage levels will create a lowered base for the next round of negotiations. Hence, the interindustry wage structure should narrow over the next several years.\n\nTo summarize, based on CBO estimates, it appears that the structural component of the displaced worker problem is approximately 300,000 workers. As the economy recovers and employment in even the declining industries increases above 1982 trough levels, that number will decline. Hence, the problem, although severe for affected individuals, is not large in size. Contrary to some popular, pessimistic scenarios concerning long-run technological displacement in industrial employment, it can be argued that faster technological change will increase real wage growth and not unemployment.\n\nPolicies to assist those workers who are displaced must focus on the fact that those workers can be found new jobs. Most have exhibited the ability to learn marketable skills and have had a history of solid job attachment. Their problem is not so much their temporary unemployment as it is the permanent gap between their old wage level and their opportunity wage in new employment.\n\nGovernment labor market policy measures can reduce the size of this gap but not eliminate it. Training and employment vouchers can return displaced workers to new jobs and probably raise their future wages somewhat above what they would have been absent government assistance. Trade Adjustment Assistance-type cash transfers can reduce the burden of the transitional period of unemployment. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that any of these measures can have a large quantitative effect in closing the wage loss gap created by job displacement.\n\nThe result is that the loss to displaced individuals can only be managed, to any significant extent, by avoiding the job loss in the first place. In terms of government policy, direct employment protection afforded to declining industries would be necessary. Tariff protection is the obvious remedy, although the enormous costs of that approach are equally obvious. Absent this radical government policy departure, the solution to job displacement rests with private-sector parties.\n\nThe evidence, although preliminary, suggests that rising union wage premiums during the 1970s and early 1980s have contributed to the displaced worker problem. First, the increase in the wage premi-ums is likely to have been a factor in the long-run decline in employment in certain industries. Secondly, the increased premium has led to a larger gap between past and opportunity wages of displaced workers. If this is the case, collective bargaining initiatives to trade off wage premiums for enhanced job security could be an important element in any strategy to reduce the scope of the problem.\n\n.
