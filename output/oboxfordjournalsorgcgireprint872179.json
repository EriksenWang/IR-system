    "abstract": "Early cellular events during secondary embryogenesis were studied in a cork oak recurrent embryogenic system in which embryos arise either in a multicellular budding pathway from a compact mass of proliferation or from isolated single cells in friable callus. The compact mass of proliferation originated from the epidermal cells at the hypocotyl whose growth and convolution was characterized by a decrease in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and a marked increase in storage products. The transition from the compact mass to meristematic primordia occurred at the periphery and was accompanied by cell dedierentiation and a drastic reduction of storage products. Meristematic primordia evolved to globular embryos by the organization of a protodermis and two internal centres. Microscope analysis of friable callus showed an hypothetical sequence from single cells to aggregates of a few cells, meristematic cell clusters and globular embryos. Single cells showed typical features of embryogenic cells such as rich cytoplasm and a large number of starch grains and lipid bodies. A progressive cell dedierentiation and a drastic reduction of storage products was observed when aggregates of a few cells and meristematic cell clusters were compared. Progressive bipolarization in large meristematic cell clusters initiated globular embryo formation. The comparison of both embryogenic pathways at the ultrastructural level showed that subcellular changes follow a similar sequential pattern, especially with regard to the storage products. The possible role of plastid extrusions and multivesicular bodies in the changing pattern of starch metabolism during embryogenesis is discussed.",
    "full_text": "Embryo production by recurrent or secondary embryogenesis is the step giving somatic embryogenesis a multiplicative potential for clonal mass propagation (Merkle, 1995). Secondary embryos arise from super®cial single cells or by multicellular budding, usually at the hypocotyl of the mother embryo (Williams and Maheswaran, 1986). Embryo origin is especially relevant to the genetic uniformity of regenerated plants; as a multicellular origin may result in the formation of genetically variable chimeric plants, a unicellular origin is the desired pathway for practical applications of embryo cloning such as genetic transformation.\n\nRecurrent systems are especially suited to the continuous production of friable callus, which is a valuable source of single cells with embryogenic capacity (Fransz and Schel, 1994). Nevertheless, information about embryos' actual origin and early dierentiation in friable callus is scarce and fragmentary. In the literature most observers agree that embryos develop from small aggregates of embryogenic cells which, in turn, come from single cytoplasm-rich cells (Yeung, 1995). However, the whole developmental sequence from single cells to heart-shaped embryos has only been fully documented for the carrot suspension culture (Toonen et al., 1994;Yasuda et al., 2000). In addition, although ultrastructural characterization of friable callus may contribute greatly to a better understanding of the embryogenic process, subcellular studies have concentrated on carrot (Halperin and Jensen, 1967) and a few gramineous systems (Karlsson and Vasil, 1986;Fransz and Schel, 1991a, b;Taylor and Vasil, 1996). With regard to somatic embryogenesis from multiple cells, it has been described as taking place through a meristematic budding pattern, but only a few primary systems (Wernicke et al., 1982;McCain and Hodges, 1986;Stamp, 1987;Hepher et al., 1988;Schwendimann et al., 1988;Canhoto et al., 1996;Taylor and Vasil, 1996) and cork oak (Quercus suber L.) secondary embryogenesis (Puigderrajols et al., 1996) have been characterized morphologically. However, subcellular events have only been investigated in pearl millet (Gramineae) (Taylor and Vasil, 1996) and the woody pineapple guava (Myrtaceae) (Canhoto et al., 1996).\n\nIn the cork oak system, secondary embryos mainly originate by meristematic budding from a compact mass of proliferation (Puigderrajols et al., 1996(Puigderrajols et al., , 2000)). However, very occasionally, a brownish friable callus forms in areas of the hypocotyl in direct contact with the culture medium. Moreover, depending on culture conditions, a proliferating friable callus can be induced from which somatic embryos are easily isolated. Somatic embryogenesis by unicellular and multicellular pathways in the same explant has been demonstrated in cultured zygotic embryos of pearl millet (Taylor and Vasil, 1996) and pineapple guava (Canhoto et al., 1996). There is general agreement that, once the embryogenic process starts, there is no dierence between single or multiple-cell origin, although evidence reported in the literature is scant and not always conclusive (Fransz and Schel, 1994). Therefore, further investigation is needed before this hypothesis can be con®rmed. Embryogenic systems in which embryos develop along two pathways from the same explant may well be appropriate comparative models.\n\nIn the research reported in this paper, we investigated the ultrastructure of secondary embryo formation in a cork oak recurrent system. Our purpose was: (1) to de®ne the subcellular changes during the developmental sequence of somatic embryo formation by meristematic budding; and\n\n(2) to characterize the dierent embryonic structures found in friable callus to establish the hypothetical sequence from single cells to globular embryos. Furthermore, both embryogenic pathways are compared in the discussion.\n\nTo study somatic embryo formation by the multicellular pathway, a cork oak recurrent embryogenic line maintained on plant-growth-regulator-free medium was used (FernaÂ ndez-Guijarro et al., 1995). Subculture was carried out by transferring early cotyledonary stage embryos of about 5 mm in length to 60 mm diameter baby-food jars containing 50 ml of culture medium. Macronutrients were those from SH (Schenk and Hildebrandt, 1972) and the other components (micronutrients, vitamins, Fe-EDTA) from MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), including 3 % sucrose. The culture medium was solidi®ed with 0 . 6 % agar (Sigma, type E) and pH adjusted to 5 . 7 before autoclaving at 1218C for 20 min. The cultures were incubated in a growth chamber at 25 + 28C, and a 16 h photoperiod (50 mmol m À2 s À1 ) was provided by cool-white plus Grolux ¯uorescent lamps. Translucent dicotyledonary embryos showing signs of secondary embryogenesis were picked up during subculture and processed for histological examination. As secondary embryogenesis in cork oak is a process showing great asynchrony, the dierent developmental stages can be examined simultaneously in the same sample (Fig. 1A).\n\nTo study somatic embryo formation from friable callus, fragments of both spontaneously forming and induced proliferating friable callus were used. Proliferating friable callus was induced by transferring sections of friable tissue that broke o from the proliferation masses during subculture manipulations to vessels containing 50 ml liquid culture medium made up of MS, containing 3 % sucrose and 10 mM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). About ten pieces of tissue of up to 5 mm diameter were transferred per vessel and cultured in a rotary shaker (100 rpm) in the dark for 7 d at 25 + 28C. After treatment, the tissue pieces were subcultured on growth-regulator-free solid medium in a growth chamber at 25 + 28C and a 16 h photoperiod, as usual for the maintenance of cork oak embryogenic lines. After 1 month of culture in solid medium, a highly proliferating callus was obtained from which small portions of tissue were randomly taken with forceps for analysis. Tissue portions were slightly shaken in test tubes ®lled with liquid medium and 1 ml of the supernatant per tube was collected with a 2 mm-diameter Pasteur pipette and examined.\n\nFor light microscopy, samples were ®xed in 10 % buered formalin pH 7 . 2, dehydrated through an isopropyl alcohol series, and embedded in glycol-methacrylate (GMA). Sections 2±3 mm thick were cut and mounted on glass slides. Sections were stained with the periodic acid-Schi reaction (PA-S), toluidine blue, or thionin as described in Puigderrajols et al. (1996). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), samples were ®xed in vacuum for 72 h at room temperature in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buer. After washing in 0 . 1M cacodylate buer, samples were post-®xed in 1 % osmium tetroxide in the same buer for 2 h. After ®xing, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in Spurr medium. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with a Zeiss 910 electron microscope at 60 kV.\n\nIn our cork oak recurrent system, secondary embryo formation by meristematic budding began by cell divisions at the outer cell layers of the hypocotyl, which led to the formation of a compact mass of proliferation. The newly formed compact mass developed and became convoluted while, at the same time, proliferation extended to neighbouring areas until most of the embryo body was covered. Eventually meristematic budding took place at the periphery of the compact mass, giving rise to secondary embryo formation (Fig. 1A-C; see also Puigderrajols et al., 1996).\n\nCommonly, the ®rst visible sign of proliferation was a slight thickening of an area at the apical portion of the hypocotyl observed when the mother embryos were at a very early cotyledonary stage (Fig. 1A). At this stage, the outer cell layers of the hypocotyl consisted of a single-layered epidermis of radially oriented cells, and subjacent cortical cell layers of longitudinal oriented cells (Fig. 1D). Except for shape and orientation, epidermal and cortical cells do not dier greatly. Both contained a large nucleus with a prominent nucleolus and a fragmented vacuole (Fig. 1E and F). Mitochondria were abundant, and long pro®les of rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) appeared adjacent to the cell wall. A few lipid bodies were scattered in the cytoplasm. Plastids showed a scarcely developed inner membrane and very small starch grains. Divisions that led to the formation FIG. 1. Somatic embryo formation by the multicellular pathway.

At this early stage, cortical derivatives remained distinct from epidermal derivatives and could be recognized by cell orientation and by a perceptibly greater thickness in the cell walls between the two groups.\n\nFurther divisions of epidermal cells led to a reduction in cell size and cells becoming rounder. The cytoplasm showed an increase in Golgi bodies and rough ER in both short and long pro®les. However, in these proliferating cells lipid bodies increased in size and number, and plastids had larger starch grains and took on a dumbbell shape (Fig. 1H). Plasmodesmata associated with smooth ER were present between proliferating cells (Fig. 1I).\n\nOnce division started, the proliferating compact mass developed very quickly and soon became convoluted. Eventually, discrete lobes were recognized at its periphery (Fig. 2A). During this evolution of the compact mass, cells enlarged and dierentiated and a certain degree of tissue organization was reached (Fig. 2B). Cells in the lobes were ®lled by a large vacuole and showed a radial orientation. A high accumulation of storage products was noted through the presence of numerous lipid bodies and of plastids largely ®lled with starch. Between the cells, some plasmodesmatal connections could be observed.\n\nThe transition from the compact mass to meristematic primordia occurred at the periphery of the lobes. First, some cells in the outermost cell layer increased their nucleus/ cytoplasm ratio and became more isodiametric (Fig. 2A); then, changes extended immediately to other cells located inside (Fig. 2C). Next, meristematic activity was observed through the presence of numerous mitotic ®gures and, ®nally, meristematic primordia could be recognized at the periphery of the lobed mass (Fig. 3A). In cells modifying during transition, the vacuole appeared fragmented (Fig. 2D) and the cytoplasm become denser through an increase in free ribosomes. Mitochondria and Golgi bodies were abundant (Fig. 2E) and numerous microtubules were seen lying parallel to the cell wall (Fig. 2G). Wide plasmodesmata with associated ER were highly visible. Although, in general, lipid bodies and starch-containing plastids remained numerous (Fig. 2F), an apparent extrusion of the plastid content to the vacuole could be observed in some cells (Fig. 2D). Plastids located adjacent to the vacuole showed evaginated vesicles encircled by the inner and outer plastid membranes and by the tonoplast (Fig. 2H). When the transition to meristematic primordia was achieved, cells forming the primordia were outlined by thin walls without intercellular spaces (Fig. 3B). In these typically meristematic cells, a dramatic decrease in storage products was detected. Lipid bodies became very scarce and plastids, although present in large numbers, appeared devoid of starch and distorted in shape (Fig. 3C). Most primordia cells had multivesicular bodies (MVB), either free inside the vacuole or related to the tonoplast (Fig. 3B). These MVB consisted of small electron-dense vesicles encircled by a two-membrane system (Fig. 3D).\n\nThe dierentiation from meristematic primordia to globular embryos was recognized by the organization of a single-layered protodermis and of two internal centres (Fig. 3E and F). Cells in the globular embryo underwent a marked increase in lipid bodies, and plastids became more regular in shape and showed small starch grains (Fig. 3H). Although in these cells a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was maintained, the vacuole appeared variable. Possibly related to cell vacuolization, organelle-free cytoplasm areas surrounded by small vacuoles were frequent (Fig. 3G).\n\nIn our cork oak system, a brownish friable callus formed sporadically at the hypocotyl of the mother embryo (see Puigderrajols et al., 1996). Microscopic examination of this brownish callus showed mostly fragments of necrotic tissue in which isolated, cytoplasm-rich isodiametric cells and fewcelled aggregates were recognized (Figs 1C, 4A). In addition, an embryogenic friable callus was induced from tissue fragments detached during subculture (see Materials and Methods). The induced callus was yellowish-white in colour, crumbly in appearance and produced somatic embryos that could be isolated easily (Fig. 4B). Under the microscope, the induced callus showed a variety of structures that could be classi®ed in three groups: fragments of non-proliferating tissue with an irregular shape consisting of highly vacuolated cells bearing isolated isodiametric cytoplasm-rich cells and few-celled aggregates mainly at their periphery (Fig. 4C); clusters of meristematic cells, varying in size and shape (Fig. 5A and E); and embryo structures at dierent stages of development (Fig. 5H and K).\n\nAt the ultrastructural level, the isolated isodiametric cytoplasm-rich single cells, about 20 mm in diameter, were characterized by a thick wall, dense cytoplasm, a large nucleus and a large vacuole ®lled with a ®ne granular content (Fig. 4D). Plastids were numerous and contained osmiophilic granules and from one to many large starch grains. A large number of lipid bodies was also present. Numerous free ribosomes and rough ER pro®les were scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4E). The isolated few-celled aggregates consisted of small clusters and narrow strands of cells, usually of two to ®ve cells per section, surrounded by an external cell wall thicker than the internal walls (Fig. 4F).

Vacuoles become more fragmented (D); mitochondria and Golgi bodies increase in number (E); lipid bodies and starch grains are still present (F); wide open plasmodesmata and a welldeveloped cytoskeleton (arrowheads) are commonly seen (G). At this stage, plastids adjacent to the vacuole form extrusions (D, arrow) that consist of (H) the tonoplast and the outer plastid membrane surrounding small vesicles encircled by the inner plastid membrane.

All cells in a cluster were connected by numerous plasmodesmata (Fig. 4G), but no plasmodesmata could be found in the external cell wall. The group of meristematic cell clusters was composed of clumps of small densely packed cytoplasm-rich cells, varying in size and shape. Most cell clusters were free or with attached small remains of non-proliferating tissue. Some of them, usually those of smaller size (about 100 to 200 mm in diameter), were also located at the periphery of non-proliferating tissue fragments (Fig. 4C). Some clusters were globular in shape (Fig. 5A), but other more irregular clusters showed signs of tissue disorganization (Fig. 5E). Small globular-shaped clusters consisted of typically meristematic cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, a thin cell wall and dense cytoplasm with numerous free ribosomes (Fig. 5B). Lipid bodies were low in number, and plastids, distorted in shape, were largely devoid of starch. Plastid extrusions and MVBs were related to the vacuole (Fig. 5C and D). All cells in a cluster were connected by plasmodesmata. These small globular clusters had numerous mitotic ®gures, had no polarity and were unorganized. In contrast, larger globular clusters (about 200 to 400 mm) usually had a shape polarized by the presence of two histological regions with a gradual transition between them. While one region was characterized by small cytoplasm-rich cells, the opposite region had somewhat larger and more vacuolated cells. The more irregularly-shaped clusters (Fig. 5E) were usually also large (up to 500 mm) and had vacuolated cells mainly at their periphery. These vacuolated cells of variable shape showed signs of cell degradation; electron dense accumulations and multilamellar or myelinlike bodies were common between the cell wall and the plasmalemma (Fig. 5F and G).\n\nGlobular-shaped embryos were recognized by their well-de®ned protodermis and signs of internal organization (Fig. 5H). Embryo cells commonly showed a high nucleus/ cytoplasm ratio and thin cell walls but their vacuolation was variable. Lipid bodies and plastids with small starch grains were relatively abundant (Fig. 5J). Cytoplasm areas without organelles, encircled by small vacuoles, were commonly seen (Fig. 5I). No intercellular spaces were seen between the cells. When present, embryo structures corresponding to heart-shaped or early cotyledonary stage embryos were free, even though some friable tissue occasionally remained attached (Fig. 5K).\n\nResults showed that in the cork oak system the compact mass of proliferation is of epidermal origin, although a contribution from the outermost cortical cell layers of the hypocotyl cannot be discounted. The ultrastructural observations about the meristematic budding described above reveal a sequence of cellular changes aecting the symmetry of cell division, cell orientation, organelle composition and the accumulation of storage products. A critical point in this developmental sequence occurs at the periphery of the lobes, when the transition to meristematic primordia begins. Before this point, cells showed a progressive reduction in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and a marked increase in storage products (starch grains and lipid bodies). After this point, the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio increased and a progressive reduction in storage products was observed. Changes in the pattern of storage product metabolism and an enhancement of mitotic activity are features commonly associated with the initiation of embryo dierentiation (Yeung, 1995). Therefore, the onset of embryo dierentiation in the cork oak system seems to be found at this critical point when several neighbouring cells act in a co-ordinated fashion to give rise to meristematic primordia. The multicellular character of this embryogenic pathway is supported by the presence during transition of wide-open plasmodesmata and a well-developed cytoskeleton. Plasmodesmata are recognized as key regulatory elements in cells co-operating as a functional unit (van Bel and van Kesteren, 1999). Cytoskeletal elements are also considered critical for the establishment of embryo polarity (Webb and Gunning, 1991). Therefore, in cork oak the individual meristematic primordia should be considered as pro-embryo structures that precede globular embryo organization.\n\nIn pearl millet (Taylor and Vasil, 1996) and in pineapple guava (Canhoto et al., 1996), zygotic embryos ( primary somatic embryos of multiple-cell origin) dierentiate from a meristematic proliferation of epidermal and subepidermal origin after the inductive treatment. In cork oak, somatic cotyledons detached from the embryo axis (Puigderrajols et al., 2000), secondary embryos of multicellular origin also dierentiated from a meristematic proliferation of parenchyma origin at the petiole. In all these cases, a rapid cell dedierentiation and a drastic reduction in storage products took place when meristematic proliferation started. According to Taylor and Vasil (1996), embryo development in pearl millet actually begins when epidermal and subepidermal cell dedierentiation starts and the entire meristematic proliferation is a proembryonal complex. The compact mass to meristematic primordia transition observed in the cork oak recurrent system would be equivalent to this.\n\nAlthough in cork oak a compact mass of proliferation precedes secondary embryo formation, this compact mass should not be considered as a true callus. The compact mass shows a certain degree of tissue organization and it is unable to proliferate inde®nitely as usually occurs in callus proliferations. Therefore, cells in the compact mass should be seen as pre-embryogenically determined cells (PEDC) from which embryo dierentiation proceeds without a prior redetermination phase. Therefore, secondary embryogenesis in cork oak should be considered direct, at least in the sense that no undierentiated callus phase is present before embryogenic cell determination (Sharp et al., 1980). However, some authors (Duhem et al., 1989) suggest that the presence of such limited proliferation before embryogenesis would be an intermediate modality between direct and indirect embryogenesis.\n\nAlthough ours was not a sequential analysis, from the comparison of the dierent structures found in cork oak friable callus with the structures described in the literature for other friable systems, a hypothetical development sequence from single cells to globular embryos may be proposed in which the isolated few-celled aggregates and the clusters of meristematic cells may represent intermediate stages.\n\nIsodiametric cytoplasm-rich single cells in cork oak have the same features as embryogenic cells in other systems, such as carrot (Halperin and Jensen, 1967), guinea grass (Karlsson and Vasil, 1986), maize (Fransz and Schel, 1991a) or pearl millet (Taylor and Vasil, 1996). The most outstanding features of these cells are a high nucleus/ cytoplasm ratio, dense cytoplasm and the presence of large amounts of lipids and starch. It is reported in the literature that single cells divide to form few-celled proembryo structures which are referred to as proembryo-like units in carrot (Halperin and Jensen, 1967), embryogenic units in maize (Fransz and Schel, 1991a) or proembryonic cell masses in pearl millet (Taylor and Vasil, 1996). Such proembryo structures correspond to the isolated few-celled aggregates in cork oak. The presence of a thick cell wall surrounding these aggregates, which probably represents the wall of the original single cell, supports this hypothesis (Vasil and Vasil, 1982b;Karlsson and Vasil, 1986). The absence of plasmodesmata in the external cell wall and their presence in the internal walls reinforce this view. The globular clusters of meristematic cells represent proembryo structures derived from few-celled aggregates. Small globular clusters without visible polarity correspond to earlier proembryos, whereas globular clusters in which polarity has been already established correspond to later stages before globular embryo dierentiation. In carrot suspension cultures, few-celled proembryo structures increase their division rate, which leads to the formation of dense globular cell masses that, according to Halperin and Jensen (1967), are functional proembryos. Maize proembryonic structures, referred to as embryogenic units, evolve to somatic embryos through intermediate structures, referred to as transition units (Fransz and Schel, 1991a, b). These maize transition units would correspond to the cork oak polarized globular meristematic cell clusters.\n\nA relatively high rate of proliferation characterizes the induced friable callus in cork oak. This proliferating capacity could be related to alternating cycles of growth and fragmentation. The tissue disorganization shown by the clusters with a more irregular shape provides evidence of such behaviour. Some cells in these more irregular clusters show signs of degradation, such as the presence of multilamellar bodies (Konar et al., 1972;Verdus et al., 1993) and electron dense accumulations (Rohr et al., 1989). Cell degradation may lead to tissue fragmentation, followed by a reinitiation of the growing cycle. Such behaviour may represent a failure in proembryo development as a result of inadequate culture conditions. According to Sachs (1991), a weak signal that destabilizes polarity may inhibit further proembryo development. Thus, culture conditions play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of embryo polarity. Under the continued presence of auxin, proembryogenic cell masses in carrot suspension culture undergo cycles of growth and fragmentation but, on low or no auxin, embryo development proceeds rapidly from small proembryogenic cell masses (Halperin, 1995).\n\nThere is a general consensus that reserves are crucial to morphogenetic processes. The presence of high levels of hydrocarbon reserves such as starch has been reported at the beginning of several in vitro development processes (Mangat et al., 1990;Branca et al., 1994). In addition, a dramatic decrease in starch amounts has been reported when organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis start (Mangat et al., 1990;Martin et al., 2000). Our observations of cork oak corroborate these earlier ®ndings. In the meristematic budding pathway, the highest levels in lipid and starch content are reached in the compact mass cells before primordia initiation. The highest levels of reserves in the friable callus pathway are shown by isodiametric cytoplasm-rich single cells. However, the minimum levels correspond to cells in meristematic primordia and in the small clusters of meristematic cells. Therefore, in both pathways, a change in the pattern of storage product metabolism occurs at the moment at which somatic embryo dierentiation apparently begins. It is known that sucrose has a signi®cant regulatory and integrative function in plant development and that changes in sucrose content are transduced into changes in gene expression (Farrar et al., 2000). It is very possible that the rapid hydrolysis of starch when embryogenesis starts provides not only energy and carbon sources for proliferation, but may also play a regulatory role.\n\nOur results suggest a possible role for MVB in the rapid catabolism of starch. In fact, one of the most outstanding features in the modifying cells during compact mass-tomeristematic primordia transition was the apparent extrusion of the plastid content into vacuole, followed by an increase in MVB, either free or related to the tonoplast. Moreover, in friable callus, plastid extrusions and MVB were very abundant in the small globular clusters of meristematic cells. Although MVB have been reported in embryogenic systems, their origin has been commonly related to ER or Golgi apparatus (Verdus et al., 1993). That MVB may also originate in plastids is supported by ultrastructural observations of the membrane system involved in plastid extrusions and the morphology of MBV in our cork oak system.\n\nThe results presented in this paper con®rm the hypothesis of Williams and Maheswaran (1986) that single-cell and FIG. 4.

Further investigation into the cork oak system should be centred on the study of culture conditions which allow high rates of embryo development from single cells.\n\nPuigderrajols et al.ÐCork Oak Secondary Embryogenesis from Multiple and Single Cells\n\nPuigderrajols et al.ÐCork Oak Secondary Embryogenesis from Multiple and Single Cells"
