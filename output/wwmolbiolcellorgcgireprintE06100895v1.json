    "full_text": "The chromosomal passenger proteins are an interesting group of proteins that play many important roles in cell division. The inner centromeric protein (INCENP), Aurora B, and Survivin associate with each other to form a chromosomal passenger-protein complex (CPC) known to exist in unicellular and multicellular organisms (Kang et al., 2001;Bolton et al., 2002;Cheeseman et al., 2002). In addition, the chromosomal passenger proteins TD60 and Borealin can also associate with the CPC and regulate its activity (Mollinari et al., 2003;Gassmann et al., 2004;Sampath et al., 2004;Klein et al., 2006). It has been well established that the CPC is essential for the regulation of chromosome condensation, chromosome congression, spindle formation, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (Mackay et al., 1998;Kim et al., 1999;Adams et al., 2001a;Giet and Glover, 2001;Cheeseman et al., 2002;Tanaka et al., 2002;Gassmann et al., 2004;Sampath et al., 2004).\n\nA hallmark property of chromosomal passenger proteins is their dynamic localization during cell division. The CPC is localized on chromosomes and centromeres before metaphase and then is found on the spindle midzone during anaphase and at the cleavage furrow and midbody during cytokinesis (Cooke et al., 1987;Earnshaw and Cooke, 1991).\n\nThe correct localization of the CPC at each stage of the cell cycle is crucial for its proper function. For example, an INCENP mutant that remains tethered to centromeres throughout mitosis inhibits cytokinesis (Eckley et al., 1997). Interestingly, the chromosomal passenger proteins are interdependent on their localization (Adams et al., 2000;Wheatley et al., 2001;Honda et al., 2003;Gassmann et al., 2004). In particular, the kinase activity of Aurora B is important for the proper distribution of the CPC during cell division (Honda et al., 2003).\n\nThe dynamic localization of the CPC must be regulated by specific mechanisms acting at distinct locations of the cell at different stages of the cell cycle. Some of these mechanisms Manuscript #E06-10-0895R FINAL have been discovered in recent years. For example, the redistribution of the CPC from the centromeres to the spindle midzone is controlled by dephosphorylation of INCENP by the phosphatase CDC14 (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003). In some systems, a mitotic kinesin like protein MKLP-2 also appears to be essential for the redistribution of CPC from centromeres to the central spindle (Gruneberg et al., 2004).\n\nIn contrast to these events in mitosis, the association of INCENP and other chromosomal passenger proteins with the cortex of the cleavage furrow has not been explored in detail. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies have shown that INCENP associates with the cortex of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (Earnshaw and Cooke, 1991;Eckley et al., 1997). However, in most animal systems, it is difficult to distinguish the localization of the CPC at the spindle midzone from that at the cleavage furrow since they are often closely juxtaposed. The presence of the microtubule-rich midbody, derived from the spindle midzone makes this distinction even more difficult. In animal cells, all manipulations that abrogate localization of the CPC at the spindle midzone also result in lack of localization at the midbody (Ainsztein et al., 1998;Mackay et al., 1998;Honda et al., 2003). By contrast, this distinction can be made more readily in Dictyostelium cells. The Dictyostelium spindle is slender compared to that of metazoans, and is easily distinguished from the ingressing cleavage furrow. Furthermore, the Dictyostelium spindle is dismantled before the cleavage furrow severs the cell and no midbody is formed (Roos and Camenzind, 1981;Roos et al., 1984;McIntosh et al., 1985).\n\nWe showed previously that Dictyostelium INCENP (DdINCENP) localizes to the cortex of the cleavage furrow and is required for the abscission of the daughter cells (Chen et al., 2006). Importantly, the distribution of DdINCENP at the cleavage furrow is altered by the loss of myosin II. Instead of the broad cleavage furrow distribution observed in wild type Manuscript #E06-10-0895R FINAL cells, DdINCENP localizes as a narrow band at the equatorial plane of myosin II null cells.\n\nThese observations suggested that DdINCENP may be able to interact with the actomyosin cytoskeleton (Chen et al., 2006).\n\nMitotic kinesin like proteins (MKLPs), a subgroup of the kinesin-6 family of proteins, have been suggested to play an important role in regulating the localization of chromosomal passenger proteins during cell cycle (Gruneberg et al., 2004). Dictyostelium has a single kinesin 6-related protein called Kif12. Kif12 localizes to the spindle midzone and is important for mitosis and cytokinesis (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004). Normal localization of myosin II to the cleavage furrow requires Kif12, suggesting a possible interaction between Kif12 and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, Kif12 null mutants frequently fail in the abscission of daughter cells in a manner similar to DdINCENP null mutants (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004). The similarity of localization and mutant phenotype of these two proteins prompted us to explore possible interactions between them. We show here that, in fact, Kif12 is required for the furrow localization of DdINCENP. We also determined that an amino terminal portion of DdINCENP is required for furrow localization and is able interact with the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nThe cells were cultured with HL-5 medium in Petri dishes at 19 o C. GFP-DdINCENP and GFP-Kif12 were described previously (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004;Chen et al., 2006).\n\nBoth plasmids carry a G418-resistance cassette. The constructs were introduced into cells with electroporation and the transformants were selected in HL-5 medium with 10 µg/ml G418.\n\nFor live microscopy of mitotic cells, cells in log phase growth were plated on a small\n\nPetri dish with a cover slip on the bottom (MatTek, Ashland, MA). After the cells attached to the plate, the medium was removed and replaced with low-fluorescence (LF) medium for at least 30 minutes before observations (Bretschneider et al., 2002). The live imaging of the cells was conducted using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Dallas, TX) equipped with a 100x 1.4 NA PlanFluor Objective, shuttered illumination, and a Quantix 57 camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) controlled by Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The exposure time for the GFP fluorescence was 50 ms with the interval time being at least 10 s.\n\nThe cells were allowed to attach to acid-cleaned cover slips overnight in a 8.5cm Petri dish and then fixed according to published protocol (Koonce and McIntosh, 1990). Briefly, the cells were fixed at room temperature with 2.5% formaldehyde in a PIPES-EGTA buffer for 3 minutes followed by 1% formaldehyde in dehydrated methanol at -10 o C for 5 minutes.\n\nThe anti-alpha-tubulin antibody is a monoclonal antibody from Sigma (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The secondary antibody is a Texas-red conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The protocol for DAPI-staining was described previously (Gerald et al., 2001).\n\nThe protocol for staining F-actin was modified from the one previously described by Gerald et. al (Gerald et al., 1998). Briefly, 2 x10 5 cells were plated on a coverslip. Then, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PDF (2 mM KCl, 1.1 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 1.32 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.25 mM MgSO 4 , pH 6.7) for 20 minutes at room temperature before being permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes. The coverslip was washed 3 times in a fixing chamber with PBS buffer before the cells were stained with TxRed conjugated Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS for 30 min in a covered humid chamber at room temperature. The coverslip was washed three times in PBS, and rinsed briefly in dH 2 O before being mounted onto a glass slide.\n\nDdINCENP 1-500 was cloned downstream of the TAP-GFP sequence in the pTX-TAPGFP plasmid constructed by Joe Mireles in our laboratory. The procedure for purifying the TAP tagged protein in Dictyostelium was modified from the one described by Rigaut (Rigaut et al., 1999) and that by Koch (Koch et al., 2006). For large scale purification, 500 ml IgG agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) were pre-equilibrated and washed with 15ml IPP150 buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % NP40, pH 8.0). The IgG beads were added to the supernatant of the cell lysate and incubated on a rotator for 2 h at 4°C in a 50 ml tube to allow the TAP tagged proteins to bind to the beads. The suspension was packed into a 15 ml column (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). The packed beads were washed with 30 ml IPP150 buffer followed by 10 ml of TEV cleavage buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0). Then, 150 units of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added with 1 ml TEV cleavage buffer to the Manuscript #E06-10-0895R FINAL column. The suspension was incubated at 4°C in the column on a rocker overnight to allow the thorough digestion of the proteins from the beads.\n\nThe flow through (1 ml) from the column was collected and a small aliquot was examined by SDS-PAGE gel. As reported previously (Koch et al., 2006), we found that this one step purification of our tagged proteins was sufficient to yield a highly pure preparation.\n\nSubsequent purification by binding to a Calmodulin column (Rigaut et al., 1999) did not improve the purity of our protein preparations.\n\nIndividual protein bands from the SDS-PAGE gel were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion (Shevchenko et al., 1996). They were then identified through peptide mass fingerprinting (MASCOT, Matrix Sciences, Boston, MA). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the database of NCBI. Identification of the proteins was confirmed through manual evaluation of spectra. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed by the core facilities of the Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe MKLP-related protein Kif12 localizes at the cleavage furrow and is required for the localization of DdINCENP at the cleavage furrow.\n\nWe showed previously that Kif12, like MKLP proteins in metazoans, is found on the Dictyostelium spindle during mitosis and is important for mitosis and cytokinesis (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004). Surprisingly, further detailed observations of cells expressing GFP-Kif12 revealed that a small but significant amount also localized at the ingressing cleavage furrow (Figure 1, movie 1). Kif12 was never observed near the plasma membrane of interphase cells or in the polar cortical region of dividing cells, suggesting that its furrow localization may be tightly regulated and important for cytokinesis.\n\nSince both Kif12 and DdINCENP are found at the central spindle and cleavage furrow (Movies 1 & 2) and since the loss of either protein leads to a similar late cytokinesis defect (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004;Chen et al., 2006), we explored the possibility of an interaction between these two proteins during cytokinesis. We first determined whether Kif12 was required for the localization of DdINCENP during mitosis or cytokinesis by comparing the localization of GFP-DdINCENP in wild-type and Kif12 null cells. We found that GFP-DdINCENP localized normally to the spindle poles and central spindle during anaphase and telophase in both cells types. In contrast, GFP-DdINCENP did not localize at the cortex of the cleavage furrow in Kif12 null cells (Figure 2, and Movie 3). The failure of DdINCENP to localize on the cleavage furrow was not due to a defective central spindle in these cells. We examined the morphology of the central spindle in Kif12 null cells and found that it was indistinguishable from that in wild type cells (Supplemental figure 1). In addition, we found that GFP-DdINCENP was retained on the central spindle of Kif12 null cells throughout cytokinesis. Even after the central spindle fractured into two halves, GFP-DdINCENP was still associated with the broken end of the dismantling spindle in each daughter cell (Figure 2, and Movie 3). We observed a total of 14 Kif12 null cells undergoing mitosis and cytokinesis.\n\nOf these, five were able to initiate cytokinesis and all of them failed to localize GFP-DdINCENP at the cortex of the cleavage furrow retaining it, instead, on their central spindle.\n\nThe remaining nine cells were not able to initiate cytokinesis although GFP-DdINCENP still localized on their central spindle (data not shown). We also examined the cleavage furrow of fixed Kif12 null cells and did not detect any GFP-DdINCENP at the cortex of the cleavage furrow (data now shown). Thus, these results suggest that Kif12 is required for the redistribution of DdINCENP from the central spindle to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis.\n\nWe (Figure 4). This protein was found in the nucleus of interphase cells (data not shown) and was still able to localize on the mitotic spindle poles and central spindle (Figure 6). However, this mutant protein did not show any enrichment either at the cortex of the cleavage furrow or the cytoplasmic bridge connecting the two daughter cells (Figure 5, and Movie 5).\n\nIn contrast, our second mutant DdINCENP 1-1013 , which lacks the C-terminal IN-box domain, retained the ability to localize at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells (Figure 5, and Movie 6). This protein also localized on the central spindle and poles (Figure 6). Thus, it seems that localization at the cleavage furrow is dependent on the amino terminal portion of DdINCENP. Not surprisingly, neither of these two mutant proteins was able to rescue the cytokinesis defect of DdINCENP null cells (data not shown). Clearly, both localization at the furrow and the ability to interact with Aurora B kinase are important for its function during cytokinesis.\n\nTo further define the portion of DdINCENP involved in cleavage furrow localization, we constructed a mutant protein containing only the first 500 amino acids of DdINCENP.\n\nThis protein lacks any nuclear localization signal and was thus found in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (see below). Interestingly, DdINCENP 1-500 was able to enter the nucleus in mitosis and localized at the central spindle and spindle poles (Figure 6). Most importantly, DdINCENP 1-500 was then able to localize at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and was clearly visible in the cytoplasmic bridge connecting the two daughter cells (Figure 5, and Movie 7).\n\nSince DdINCENP 1-500 still contained one of the two coiled-coil portions found in DdINCENP, we decided to examine the requirement of this region for cleavage furrow localization of DdINCENP. We found that a smaller truncation protein, DdINCENP 1-273 , was still able to localize to the central spindle and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (Figure 5, 6, and Movie 8).\n\nLogically, the requirement of Kif12 for the localization of DdINCENP at the cleavage furrow should also apply to these truncated mutants. Therefore, we investigated the localization of DdINCENP 1-500 in the Kif12 null cells. Similar to full length DdINCENP, DdINCENP 1-500 failed to localize at the cleavage furrow in the absence of Kif12 (Supplemental figure 2 & Movies 9-10). This further confirmed our finding that Kif12 is required to target DdINCENP to the cortex of the cleavage furrow.\n\nDdINCENP 1-500 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nWe showed previously that the distribution of DdINCENP at the cleavage furrow is modulated by myosin II, suggesting the ability of DdINCENP to interact with the actinmyosin cytoskeleton (Chen et al., 2006). Presumably, this ability is found at the amino terminus of DdINCENP since this region was able to localize at the cleavage furrow (Figure 5). Thus, we decided to explore in more detail the behavior of this portion of DdINCENP.\n\nSince DdINCENP 1-500 lacks a nuclear localization signal [encoded by amino acids 728-755 (Figure 4)] it resided in the cytoplasm of interphase cells. We were intrigued to find that DdINCENP 1-500 was associated with the cortex of the cell during interphase. In particular, we found that DdINCENP 1-500 was prominently found at the base of pinocytic cups, actin-rich structures (Figure 7 and Movies 11 & 12). While we do not interpret this localization as a normal function of DdINCENP (full length DdINCENP is never found on these structures), we see it as indicative of an intrinsic ability of the N-terminus of DdINCENP to interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, we found that DdINCENP 1-500 sedimented with the Triton X-find DdINCENP 1-500 in all actin-rich regions of the cell. For example, we did not see this protein at the leading pseudopod of migrating cells which is enriched in many other F-actin binding proteins (data not shown). Thus, we hypothesized that DdINCENP 1-500 interacted with a particular portion of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nTo explore the interaction of DdINCENP 1-500 with the actin cytoskeleton in more detail we constructed a TAP (Tandem Affinity Purification) tagged GFP-DdINCENP 1-500, which had a similar localization as the untagged protein (data now shown). The tagged protein was purified from Dictyostelium extracts. As a control we also purified proteins associated with TAP-GFP. By comparing the profiles of these two purifications, we identified 4 proteins that copurified with TAP-DdINCENP 1-500 but not with TAP-GFP control (Figure 8). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the identity of these proteins as: Myosin II, actin, HSC70, and the actin binding protein ABP-50. Western blot analysis of our fractions with an antibody against Kif12 failed to detect any Kif12 copurifying with GFP-DdINCENP 1-500 . However, since our purifications are prepared from asynchronous cultures it is unlikely that we would copurify proteins that interact with GFP-DdINCENP 1-500 during cytokinesis. Unfortunately there are no currently available methods to synchronize Dictyostelium cultures to a satisfactory degree for these studies. Nonetheless, these results highlight the fact that the Nterminus of DdINCENP has the ability to interact with a unique subset of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nKif12 is required for the localization of DdINCENP at the cleavage furrow.\n\nThe chromosomal passenger proteins complex (CPC) has a dynamic localization during mitosis and cytokinesis. First, they localize on the chromosome arms and focus on centromeres at the transition from prophase to prometaphase. Then, they relocate to the central spindle at the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Finally, they redistribute to the cortex of the cleavage furrow as cells enter cytokinesis (Cooke et al., 1987;Honda et al., 2003). Some details about the molecular mechanisms controlling CPC movement have been recently described. In S. cerevisiae, the action of CDC14 phosphatase regulates the localization of INCENP and Aurora B kinase at the central spindle (Pereira and Schiebel, 2003). More recently, it has been demonstrated that MKLP2 is required for the redistribution of Aurora B kinase from centromeres to the central spindle (Gruneberg et al., 2004).\n\nHowever, little is know about how the CPC can change localization from the central spindle to the cortex of the cleavage furrow at the beginning of cytokinesis.\n\nKif12 belongs to the KIF-6 family of kinesin-related proteins (Kollmar and Glockner, 2003;Lakshmikanth et al., 2004). It is the only member of this kinesin family in Dictyostelium, while there are three KIF-6 kinesins in human including MKLP1, MKLP-2 and M-phase phosphoprotein 1 (MPP1) (Miki et al., 2001;Kollmar and Glockner, 2003). All three mammalian MKLPs play important roles during cytokinesis (Hill et al., 2000;Kuriyama et al., 2002;Abaza et al., 2003). Among the three, MKLP1 and MKLP2 have been well\n\nstudied. Both of them localize to the central spindle at anaphase and highly concentrate in the midbody during cytokinesis. Additionally, they both can crosslink the anti-parallel microtubules to help assemble the central spindle (Nislow et al., 1992;Matuliene and Kuriyama, 2002;Neef et al., 2003). However, they play different roles during cytokinesis.\n\nMKLP-1 interacts with MgcRacGAP to form a centralspindlin complex, which interacts with RhoA (Mishima et al., 2002;Mishima et al., 2004). In comparison, MKLP-2, also known as Rab6 kinesin (Echard et al., 1998), is required for the redistribution of both Aurora B and Polo kinase from the centromeres to the central spindle (Neef et al., 2003;Gruneberg et al., 2004). ZEN-4 is the only kinesin-6 family protein found in C. elegans and there are two kinesin-6 family proteins found in Drosophila, Pavarotti and KLP67A (Kollmar and Glockner, 2003). Whereas loss of Pavarotti led to a complete failure of cleavage furrow ingression, loss of Zen-4 led to a late cytokinesis defect where the cleavage furrow would initiate but eventually regressed (Adams et al., 1998;Raich et al., 1998;Dean et al., 2005).\n\nWe have shown that Kif12 null cells have similar cytokinesis defects; some cells fail to initiate cleavage furrow formation (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004), while others initiate but fail to complete cytokinesis.\n\nWe demonstrated here that Kif12 associates with the cleavage furrow in addition to its association with the mitotic spindle. This is similar to MKLP2, a Kif12 homologue known to be localized on the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (Hill et al., 2000). Interestingly, MKLP2 was initially identified as a Rab-6 binding protein (Echard et al., 1998). Our data suggested that MKLP proteins may have an interaction with membranes of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. How this interaction occurs is not currently known.\n\nWe showed that Kif12, unlike its mammalian homologue, is not required for either spindle assembly or the localization of DdINCENP at the central spindle. However, we found that Kif12 is necessary for the redistribution of DdINCENP from the central spindle to the cortex of the cleavage furrow. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that Kif12 null cells have a late cytokinesis defect, which is similar to the defect found in DdINCENP null cells. These observations raised the possibility that Kif12 may be involved in directly transporting DdINCENP to the furrow. Alternatively, Kif12 may also transport a third protein to the central spindle, which in turn is required for DdINCENP to localize at the furrow.\n\nMyosin II is a protein known to require Kif12 to assemble at the cleavage furrow (Lakshmikanth et al., 2004). Since we have shown here that DdINCENP interacts with the actin/myosin II cytoskeleton, it may seem plausible to postulate that Kif12 recruits myosin II which in turn recruits DdINCENP to the cleavage furrow. However, we have shown previously that DdINCENP does not depend on myosin II to localize at the cleavage furrow (Chen et al., 2006). Thus, we suggest that Kif12 is responsible for the localization of both DdINCENP and myosin II to the cleavage furrow.\n\nWe showed previously that DdINCENP localizes on equatorial furrows but not on ectopic (Rappaport) furrows (Chen et al., 2006). Those observations suggested that DdINCENP may transfer directly from the central spindle to the cleavage furrow, since this will occur only at the equatorial plane. We would thus argue that the transport of DdINCENP to the cleavage furrow does not occur by astral microtubules since such a mechanism would not distinguish between equatorial vs. ectopic furrows. These conclusions would seem to be at odds with observations in mammalian cells showing INCENP on ectopic furrows (Savoian et al., 1999). However, we would like to point out that in that paper cells also exhibited ectopic suggested the possibility of a direct interaction between DdINCENP and the actin-myosin cytoskeleton (Chen et al., 2006). We have shown here that the N-terminal portion of DdINCENP is capable of interacting directly with the actin cytoskeleton. We found that the N-terminal domain of DdINCENP is able to localize to the cleavage furrow in a manner similar to the full length protein. Interestingly, this portion of DdINCENP was also shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton during interphase. DdINCENP 1-500 was visible on the cortex of interphase cells and concentrated particularly on pinocytic cups. Macropinocytosis is an actin-dependent process that allows Dictyostelium cells to engulf the nutrient medium by forming a pinocytic cup. This process is known to involve many actin associated proteins such as coronin, talin and profilin (Cardelli, 2001). Some of those proteins, which localize to the pinocytic sites, are also found at the cleavage furrow and have important functions during both pinocytosis and cytokinesis (Konzok et al., 1999;Cardelli, 2001;Rivero et al., 2002).\n\nWhile the localization at the pinocytic cup is clearly not a native function of full length DdINCENP, it does demonstrate the ability of this protein to interact with the actin cytoskeleton. The localization of DdINCENP 1-500 at unique actin-rich structures, like the pinocytic cup, also suggests that this fragment is not binding to the actin cytoskeleton in general, but to a specific subset of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, purification of DdINCENP 1-500 identified a subset of actin cytoskeletal proteins that copurified with DdINCENP 1-500 including ABP-50, Hsc70, actin and myosin II. The actin binding protein ABP-50 has been shown to crosslink actin filaments during chemotaxis and to localize to actin rich extensions (Demma et al., 1990;Dharmawardhane et al., 1991). Hsc70 is known as a regulator of the actin capping proteins CAP32/34 (Haus et al., 1993). Neither ABP-50 nor Hsc70 are known to concentrate on the cleavage furrow. Notably absent from our DdINCENP 1-500 purification were the abundant actin cytoskeletal proteins ABP120, cortexillin, and alpha-actinin. Thus, we would suggest that DdINCENP has the intrinsic ability to bind directly to a specific network of actin cytoskeleton found at the cleavage furrow and that this ability is regulated in the context of the full length protein, to occur only during cytokinesis.\n\nThe DdINCENP 1-500 fragment behaves as an unregulated protein that still binds to the actin network at the cleavage furrow, but in addition, to the pinocytic cup. We hope that this protein can be used as a probe to define the structural elements at the cleavage furrow that are able to recruit INCENP and perhaps other chromosomal passenger proteins. cytokinesis. Shown are two time lapse fluorescence images of wild type or Kif12 null cells expressing GFP-Kif12 during cytokinesis. GFP-Kif12 was found on the mitotic spindle. Moreover, it localized to the cortex of the cleavage furrow (white arrow) during cytokinesis and was clearly seen at the remnant of the intercellular bridge after the daughter cells separated (see movie 1).

(A-B) GFP-DdINCENP is normally found at the spindle poles and central spindle as seen in these dividing wild type cells. During cytokinesis, GFP-DdINCENP then localizes on the cortex of the cleavage furrow (arrows) (also see movie 2). (C-D) GFP-DdINCENP is still localized on the central spindle and spindle poles in Kif12 null cells. However, GFP-DdINCENP failed to localize at the cleavage furrow in the absence of Kif12 (arrows). (E) A time lapse series of a DdKif12 null cell expressing GFP-DdINCENP shows that GFP-DdINCENP was never found at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Arrows point to the cleavage furrow. Noticeably, GFP-DdINCENP was also absent from the cytoplasmic bridge at the end of cytokinesis, while it highly concentrated on the bridge in wild type cells (see movie 3).

Time lapse fluorescence micrographs of DdINCENP null cells expressing GFP-  C-terminus, two coiled coil domains and a single nuclear localization signal (*) at position 728-755. Shown are the four truncated mutants of DdINCENP used in this study. The IN-box is the only region with recognizable similarities among different INCENPs. The IN-box domain of DdINCENP is 44% identical to that of fission yeast INCENP and 21% identical to that of chicken INCENP (Chen et al., 2006). furrow during cytokinesis. The four different truncated mutants of DdINCENP were tagged with GFP and expressed in DdINCENP null cells. Time lapse fluorescence micrographs of these cells during cytokinesis are shown. The mutant protein that lacks the N-terminus, DdINCENP , was absent from the cortex of the cleavage furrow (arrows) and was homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm during cytokinesis. In contrast, the three proteins that contain the N-terminus, DdINCENP , DdINCENP , and DdINCENP , were all found at the cortex of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (arrows) (also see movie 5, 6, 7, 488-1320  the IN box or its N-terminal domain.

A time lapse fluorescence microscopy video of a kif12 null cell expressing GFP-Kif12 during cytokinesis. GFP-Kif12 localizes to the cortex of the cleavage furrow in additional to the central spindle. Moreover, it highly concentrates to the cytoplasmic bridge connecting the daughter cells during abscission. Frames were acquired every 20 s and are shown at 3 frames/s. Time is indicated in minute: second. Also see Figure 1. Movie 2: Time lapse fluorescence microscopy video of a wild type cell expressing GFP-DdINCENP during cytokinesis. DdINCENP began to localize to the cortex region of the cleavage furrow at the beginning of the cytokinesis and highly concentrated on the cytoplasmic bridge during the abscission. This pattern of localization is similar to that of Kif12. Frames were acquired every 15 s and are shown at 3 frames/s. Time is indicated in minute: second. Also see Figure 2 (A, B). Movie 3: Time lapse fluorescence microscopy video of a kif12 null cell expressing GFP-DdINCENP during cytokinesis. Although GFP-DdINCENP still localizes to the central spindle and spindle pole bodies, it was no longer found at the cleavage furrow in the absence of Kif12 (compared to Movie 2). Furthermore, GFP-DdINCENP was also absent from the cytoplasmic bridge during the abscission, while it highly concentrated on the bridge in wild type cells (see Movie 2). Time is indicated in minute: second. Frames were acquired every 15 s and are shown at 2 frames/s. Also see Figure 2."
