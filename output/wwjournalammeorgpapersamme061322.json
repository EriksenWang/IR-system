    "abstract": "Purpose: To determine the most suitable reduction data method and the optimal fitting method for the Garofalo equation. Two fitting methods were applied. The input data for this fitting are the sets of forming variables {T,σ,ε'} which have been obtained by using four different reduction methods. This procedure is applied to an ultrahigh carbon steel (UHCS). Design/methodology/approach: High temperature torsion tests have been carried out on the UHCS. A wide range of forming variables have been used. A numerical method has been implemented for the experimental data reduction. The fitting of the Garofalo equation has been carried out by means of two numerical methods. An integral method in stages, called RCR method, and a method based on Matlab algorithms called NLD. A comparative analysis of the parameters of the Garofalo equation has been conducted. Findings: The results show that the n and Q parameters are not dependent of the conversion method that has been used, Von Mises, Tresca or Eichinger. However, the α and A parameters seem to depend on the reduction method. Regarding the fitting, the RCR method is quick and efficient and its results, at the first stage, are close to the ones obtained by the NLD method. The evolution of the fitting parameters with strain for each conversion and fitting method has been determined.\nResearch limitations/implications:\nThe evolution of the parameters of the Garofalo equation are influenced by the adiabatic heating that occurs during the torsion testing. It is necessary a correct experimental design to obtain a suitable grid of data which allows an accurate determination of the strain rate sensitivity and the strain hardening coefficient. Practical implications: The fitting of the Garofalo equation for different strain values can provide information on the microscopic processes that take place during deformation. Originality/value: This work is a comparative study of the usual reduction methods and shows the utility of a method for the fitting of the Garofalo equation. This method is convergent, quick and accurate.",
    "full_text": "The torsion tests allow the attainment of flow curves of metals at large strains, and high strain rates and temperatures. The deformation is carried out by means of shear stresses, allowing high deformations because no plastic instability is involved. For this reason, these tests are suitable to simulate and optimize many of the industrial metal-forming processes.\n\nThe experimental data obtained from torsion tests are the torque and the number of turns. They are used for the conversion process to obtain the equivalent physical variables, strain, strain rate and stress.\n\nThe variables, stress, , as a function of strain rate, , usually are fitted by means of the Garofalo equation. This equation is given as follows:\n\nwhere is the strain rate, T is the absolute temperature, is the stress, Q is the activation energy for deformation, R is the gas constant, and , n and A are material constants. This equation allows extrapolating the results in order to approach the industrial conditions.\n\nUsually, the Garofalo equation is fitted at the maximum of the flow curve and at a strain where it is considered that the steady state is reached. This allows the study of the variation of the parameters of the equation as a function of strain.\n\nThe aim of this work is twofold: a) the study of the usual reduction methods and their influence on the parameters of the Garofalo equation and b) the fitting of this equation by means of two numerical methods. This procedure has been applied to an ultra high carbon steel (UHCS) containing 1•3%C.\n\nThe UHCS studied in this investigation has the following composition: 1.3%C, 0.5% Mn, 0.6% Si, 0.18% Cr and balance Fe [1]. The manganese was added to neutralize the deleterious effects of sulfur and phosphorus. The steel was obtained at Sidenor industry as a cast of 8 liters by means of an induction furnace. The as-cast ingot was initially soaked at 1050ºC and forged into a bar of 60 mm x 55 mm cross section.\n\nSimulation of the forming process of forged parts was carried out by means of torsion tests. An induction furnace heats the test sample and the temperature is continuously measured by means of a two-color pyrometer. A silica tube with argon atmosphere ensures protection against oxidation and minimum adiabatic heating. A helium atmosphere is used to obtain, after testing, a cooling rate of 325 K/s.\n\nThe torsion samples have an effective gage length of 17 mm and a radius of 3 mm.\n\nStrain rates in the range of 2 to 26 s -1 were used. The temperature range is of 900 to 1200ºC.\n\nThe samples were deformed in a SETARAM torsion machine at CENIM (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Metalúrgicas), Madrid.\n\nThe experimental data have to be transformed into equivalent physical variables in order to be able to study the constitutive differential equations for the plastic flow and specifically the Garofalo equation.\n\nThe conversion process can be divided in two main stages: the attainment of the true stress from the torque data and the attainment of the true strain from the number of turns data.\n\nFor every tested sample at constant temperature, and constant rotation speed, N , the input data for the conversion process are the torque, , and the number of turns, . The reduction process act on these experimental data and transform this data into equivalent physical variables, i.e. the output data will be the true stress, the true strain, and the true strain rate.\n\nA proper conversion process needs an enough number of tests over a wide range of the forming variables to ensure an accurate grid over the design domain.\n\nThe first step to make the reduction process is to fit the { , } experimental values. This can be done by using a phenomenological function based on the macroscopic behavior of a polycrystalline metallic material under plastic flow. The expression for this fitting is as follow:\n\n2 • • •\n\nThe first term, models the elastic part of the deformation and the zone that goes from the yield to the maximum of the curve, if exist, or to the beginning of the steady state, if not. 1. Introduction 3. conversion of torsion data 2. Material and experimental method The second term models the steady state regime. The rational part take into account the asymptotic trend of the during creep, and the exponential part represent the sharp decrease of the torque previous to rupture.\n\nWe can fit all kind of { , } set of values obtaining R 2 values of about 0.98.\n\nFig. 1 shows various fitting curves for the UHCS at various temperatures. The strain rate is 10 s -1 . The points are the experimental data { i , N i } and the lines represent the fitted function.\n\nThe selection of this model takes into account the continuity of the deformation process and the derivability conditions over the significant zones of the flow curve. This correspond to the zone of the stress peak and the possible steady state zone [2].\n\nThe problem is to find the\n\nH parameters in such a way that Eq. ( 2) fit the { i , i } data as good as possible. Therefore, we have a minimization problem and its objective function can be defined as:\n\nwhere S is the number of obtained measurements for the torsion test under consideration.\n\nThe Fields -Backofen method [3] has been employed to obtain the shear stress values, . The basic expression is the following:\n\nwhere, is the shear stress at the outer radius, is the applied torque to the cylindrical specimen, R is the radius of the specimen, is the strain hardening coefficient and m is the strain rate sensitivity. These last two coefficients are defined as follow:\n\nThe yield criteria by von Mises and Tresca are used to calculate the true stress values . The difference between these criteria mainly leads to a difference in the absolute heights of the flow stress curves whilst their relative shapes and strain rate sensitivity are not strongly affected [4]. Both criteria are also based on the assumption that the stress is independent of the strain rate, which implies a contradiction [4] since torsion test are often carried out on strain rate sensitive materials.\n\nThe strain and strain values have been calculated by two methods. The following expressions can be obtained according to the von Mises method [4]:\n\nwhere L is the gage length. According to Eichinger [5], the von Mises expressions are not correct because the strain values are excessively high and have no physical meaning. The Eichinger equations for the strain, * , and the strain rate, * are the following:\n\nwhere L R a\n\n• .\n\nThe Eichinger expressions are usually recommended to calculate large strains in torsion tests [6]. This conversion process involves that at a constant rotation speed N of the torsion machine, the true strain rate decreases with increasing strain. This can be seen in Figure 2.\n\nAccording to the work of Canova [7] to carry out a test at constant , the rotation speed should be raised to have a constant F factor in Eq. (10).\n\nTo obtain the parameter it is necessary to calculate the\n\nand to evaluate it for every i N measurement.\n\nThe expression for the derivate was calculated analytically by means of Eq. ( 2). The evaluation of the derivate on every i N gives a value on every measurement. This procedure to obtain the strain-hardening coefficient ensures an accurate determination [2].\n\nTo calculate the m parameter it is necessary to use all pairs of data { , } from tests carried out at the same temperature and at all strain rates [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to build the ) (N functions at every N value. However, the construction of these functions is based, in general, on few data points and, therefore, the calculation of the m parameter may have a large error.\n\nThe algorithm used to calculate the strain rate sensitivity has the following steps:\n\nUse of all the tests carried out at the same temperature. Determination of the final N value of each test and the minimum among these values, min N . An equal-spaced vector from 0 to . min N is build.\n\nEvaluation of the phenomenological function, Eq. ( 4), at each element of the vector and determination of { N , } data at N and T constants. Construction of the ( N ) function for each N value, whose derivate provides the m coefficient. We usually used 3 to 6 pairs of data, (as much as tests carried out at different strain rates and at the same temperature), to built this function. Therefore, its construction is associated to high levels of uncertainty. Then, among the different possibilities of interpolating these pairs (spline, piecewise cubic hermite polynomials (pchip), etc.), we chose a piecewise linear interpolation for the logarithmic data. In this way, the obtained value for m, is the average of the slopes of the lines that reach a given point { N , }. In the case of extreme points, the slope of the associated line is chosen.\n\nCalculation of the m coefficient at every measured . , N based on both, the values of m calculated at every N value, and the pchip interpolation. and different temperatures. The figure 3 shows the stress-strain curves when the Tresca criteria is used for calculating true stress values and the Von Mises method is applied to calculate true strain values. Fig. 4 shows the same tests, but the Von Mises method is used for true stress values and the Eichinger method for true strain values.\n\nIt can be seen that the maximum strain that reached the material depends on the reduction method for the strain. The Von Mises method provides a value of ~ 30 while the Eichinger method gives a value of ~ 4. Since the transition from stress values at peak to stress values at rupture in the Eichinger method occurs during a shorter interval of strain, the change of the stress as a function of the strain is larger than the one obtained by the Von Mises method. Therefore, if the Eichinger method is used, the steady state is difficult to be determined.\n\nAccording to Von Mises, the true strain of the cylindrical sample is proportional to the rotation of the machine, i.e., it is assumed that the sample behaves as a rigid solid. However, in the Eichinger method, this proportionality does not appear and the sample behaves as a Newtonian fluid under deformation.\n\nThe Garofalo equation has been fitted by two methods, RCR and NLD. This equation is highly nonlinear, and is also nonconvex, and its convexity varies along the entire working range.\n\nThese two methods are very different. The NLD algorithm works on the linearized form of the Garofalo equation and a set of initial values are needed in the design domain to obtain the optimal solution. In contrast, the RCR method is a multi-staged\n\nAnalysis of several methods for the data conversion and fitting of the Garofalo equation applied to an ultrahigh carbon steel algorithm that in its first stage works on the linearized form and then, at the later stages, works on the non-linear form. This method is auto-consistent and does not need initial values. Therefore, the results obtained by the NLD method can be only compared with the ones obtained in the first stage of the RCR method. We have checked that both results, for the UHCS, are very close, which allows the validation of both methods. 4.1. RCR method.\n\nThe RCR method has been explained, in detail, in previous works [8,9,10]. A brief description of this method is given in order to compare it with the NLD method.\n\nThe parameters\n\n4 3 2 1 , , , are defined as the coefficients of the Garofalo equation } , , , { 4 3 2 1 A n Q\n\n. At the first stage, the method minimizes the following equation that defines the total error.\n\nIf 2 parameter is a constant, Eq. ( 11) is linear in\n\nWe define a minimum and maximum value for 2 , and a 2 that is the increment of 2 . These three values are the initial data for the algorithm. The minimization problem is transformed into a problem of multilinear regression. The optimal solution are the\n\n4 3 2 1\n\n, , , values that reach a maximum of R 2 , and a maximum of the estimator F experimental of Fisher -Snedecor. They are the initial values for the second stage that are conducted by a direct non-linear regression method based on the modified Gauss-Newton method [8,9,10 in order to obtain the optimal Garofalo equation. This second stage works on the non-linear expression of the Garofalo equation. This method has been implemented with suitable parameters for the convergence control.\n\nUsing the definitions:\n\nis the Garofalo equation [11,12],the equation for the algorithm of the Gauss-Newton method is:\n\nwhere [y is the strain rate matrix [11][12][13].\n\nThe optimal solution found is the beginning for the last stage where a fine-tuning of the global optimum is obtained. This third stage is an iterative method by paths in R 2 that corresponds to two types of lines associated to alternated values of constant Q and [11,13].\n\nThis algorithm works on the linearized form of the Garofalo equation. The method solves the minimization problem defined in Eq. 11 with the following restrictions for the design variables:\n\n60 10 ; 30 10 1 1 1 10 1 ; 1000 10 1 4 ' 3 3 2 3 1 3 (14) being ) log( 4 ' 4 .\n\nAn equal-spaced grid over the design domain is defined as follows: (15) This is a grid over a 4 domain that consists on 10.000 initial values. The minimization problem is solved over every point of the grid and the optimal solution correspond to that with the minimum error. The convergence criteria that have been applied to the optimization process are very restrictive, in the sense that the stop of the algorithm occurs for a very small variation of the cost function.\n\nThe method to solve this minimization problem is based on Matlab algorithms. Concretely, the lsqcurvefit function has been used as central part of this method. This function uses a subspace trust region method based on the interior-reflective Newton method [14,15].\n\nIn the case of the UHCS, we have fitted the Garofalo equation at different strains and by different conversion methods. It has 4.1. rcr method 4.2. NLD method been observed that, for the solved fittings, around 9800 initial points converge to the same optimal solution.\n\nThe fitting of the Garofalo equation for the UHCS is based on 30 torsion tests at different strain rates and temperatures.\n\nSets of {T, ' , } data at different strains have been used to fit the Garofalo equation. The following strain values have been used: strain at maximum (~0.6), 0.8, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nFor each strain, the Garofalo equation has been fitted by the RCR and NLD methods. All the conversion processes have been used to check their influence on the parameters obtained.\n\nIn Table 1 shows the results obtained for the UHCS at all the strains under consideration. All the conversion processes and the two fitting methods are included.\n\nWe find that the parameters of the Garofalo equation do not depend significantly on the fitting method used, which means that both numerical methods work correctly.\n\nComparing the results obtained by the NLD method and the first stage of the RCR method, it is observed that the n exponent changes less than 2%, the Q parameter changes less than 0.1%, changes less than 5 % and ln(A) changes less than 1%.\n\nTable 2 show the change of the parameters of the Garofalo equation between the stage 1 and stage 3 of the RCR method. The Von Mises method for stress and the Eichinger and Von Mises methods for strain have been used. The strain value is at maximum of the stress-strain curves. It can be seen that the total error decreases once the second and the third stages are applied. These decrease is very high, at least of one order of magnitude. Table 2 also shows the variation of the parameters of Garofalo's equations from stage 1 to 3 when the RCR method is applied. The variation of the n parameter is of the order of 2% in the Von Mises -Von Mises reduction case, and of the order 4% in the Von Mises -Eichinger reduction case. For the Q parameter, the relative variation is of the order of 3.5% and 4.5% respectively. This variation can be considered as an improvement of the RCR method while it is not possible to conduct with the NLD method.\n\nFigures 5 to 8 show the evolution of the four parameters of the Garofalo equation with increasing strain. The four conversion processes have been plotted. The results showed in these figures, have been obtained by means of the NLD method. It can be observed that these parameters are not strongly influenced by, either, Tresca or Von Mises conversion method used.\n\nThe conversion methods for the strain have a significant influence on the obtained parameters. The n and A parameters decrease with increasing strain. At high strains the n parameter approaches the value of 2. This is a typical value of a superplastic material. It is worth noting that this steel have shown this behavior at lower strain rates.\n\nThe evolution of Q and is more anomalous because it shows an increase with increasing strain. This increase could be due to a change in the mechanism controlling plastic deformation. For instance, a change from slip creep to a grain boundary sliding mechanism is usually connected to a change in the activation energy.\n\nThe RCR fitting method is accurate, fast and convergent. The NLD method is an acceptable one and its error levels are similar to those obtained by the first stage of the RCR. For the UHCS-1.3%C, the optimal solution {Q, n, ln(A), }obtained by the NLD method differs less than 5 % that the one obtained by the first stage of RCR. The parameters of the Garofalo equation do not depend significantly on the conversion methods for the stress, Tresca or Von Mises. However, these parameters are influenced by the conversion method for the strain. This is because, for a given strain for each method, the deformation of the material is larger according to Eichinger than according to von Mises. From a physical viewpoint, the Eichinger method considers the material as a Newtonian fluid since the strain is not proportional to the rotation of the torsion machine.\n\nWhen the Eichinger method is used, the stress does not reach a steady state.\n\nThe n and Q parameters do not depend on the conversion method used. The and A parameters are somewhat more dependent. The parameters of the Garofalo equation show a evolution with increasing strain. Therefore, it is necessary to study the differential constitutive equations to simulate the process of the plastic deformation outside of the steady state.\n\nThe Garofalo equation is a useful tool to provide necessary conditions to the future integration of the constitutive equations.
