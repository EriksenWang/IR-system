    "full_text": "Complex a priori bounds proved to be a key analytic issue of the Renormalization Theory. They lead to rigidity results, local connectivity of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set, and convergence of the renormalized maps (see [HJ], [L2], [McMl], [McM2], [MS], [R], [S]). By definition, an infinitely renormalizable map / has complex bounds if all its renormalizations R^ f extend to quadratic-like maps with definite moduli of the fundamental annuli. Sullivan established this property for real infinitely renormalizable maps with bounded combinatorics (see [S] and [MS]). On the other hand, it was shown in [LI], [L2] that the map fi 71 / has a big modulus provided the \"essential period\" pe (R n ~lf) (see §3 for the precise definition) is big. Thus the gap between [S] and [L2] consists of quadratics of \"essentially bounded but unbounded type\". Loosely speaking for such maps the high renormalization periods are due to saddle-node behavior of the return maps. The goal of this paper is to analyze this specific phenomenon.\n\nGiven a quadratic-like map /, denote by mod(/) the supremum of the moduli of various fundamental annuli of /. We say that a real quadraticlike map / is close to the cusp if it has an attracting fixed point with the multiplier greater than ^ (one can replace ^ with 1 -e for a fixed but otherwise arbitrary e > 0). Note that a renormalizable map has no attracting fixed points and therefore is not close to the cusp. THEOREM 1.1. -Let f : z \\-> z 2 + c, c € R, be any n times renormalizable real quadratic polynomial. Let max pe(^7)<Pe.\n\nThen mod^/) > p.(pe) > 0, unless the last renormalization is of doubling type and ^f is close to the cusp. This fills the above mentioned gap: COMPLEX BOUNDS THEOREM. -There exists a universal constant ji > 0 with the following property. Let f be any n times renormalizable real quadratic. Then mod(Jr7) ^ ûnless the last renormalization is of doubling type and jR 71 / is close to the cusp. In particular, infinitely renormalizable real quadratics have universal complex a priori bounds.\n\nLet us mention here only one consequence of this result. By work of Hu and Jiang [HJ], [J] and McMullen [McM2], \"unbranched\" complex a priori bounds imply local connectivity of the Julia set J(f). (In §3 we will give the definition of \"unbranched\" bounds and will show that this property is indeed satisfied for real maps.) On the other hand, the Yoccoz Theorem gives local connectivity of J(f) for at most finitely renormalizable quadratic maps (see [H], [Ml]). Thus we have: LOCAL CONNECTIVITY THEOREM. -The Julia set of any real quadratic map z i-^ z 2 + c, c € [-2, ^], is locally connected.\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 is closer to [S] rather than to [L2]. It turns out, however, that Sullivan's Sector Lemma (see [MS]) is not valid for essentially bounded (but unbounded) combinatorics; the pullback of the plane with two slits is not necessarily contained in a definite sector. What turns out to be true instead is that the little Julia sets J^^f) are contained in a definite sector.\n\nWe will derive Theorem 1.1 from the following quadratic estimate for the renormalizations (appropriately normalized): (i.i) |jrv(^c|4 with some c > 0 depending on the bound on the essential period. The main technical point of this work is to prove (1.1). In particular, this estimate implies that the diameters of the little Julia sets J(J? 71 /) shrink to zero (see the discussion in §4), which already yields local connectivity of J{f) at the critical point.\n\nA quadratic-like map with a big modulus is close to a quadratic polynomial which is one of the reasons why it is important to analyze when the renormalizations have big moduli. It was proven in [L2] that mod(-R/) is big if and only if / has a big essential period, which together with Theorem 1.1 implies: BIG SPACE CRITERION. -There is a universal constant 7 > 0 and two functions ^(p) > v(p) > 7 > 0 tending to oo as p -^ oo with the following property. For an n times renormalizable quadratic polynomial /, ^(pe(^-1 /)) < mod(7r/) < ^(pe^-V)), unless the n-th renormalization is of doubling type and R 71 / is close to the cusp.\n\nLet us briefly outline the structure of the paper. The next section, §2, contains some background and technical preliminaries. In §3 and §6 we describe the essentially bounded combinatorics and the related saddle-node phenomenon. In §4 we state the main technical lemmas, and derive from them our results. In §5 we give a quite simple proof of complex bounds in the case of bounded combinatorics, which will model the following argument. The proofs of the main lemmas are given in the final section, §7.\n\n1. The key estimates for the moduli for maps with essentially high periods appeared in [LI], §4, while in [L2], §8, they were appropriately refined and interpreted.\n\n2. When Theorem 1.1 was proven the authors received a manuscript by Levin and van Strien [LS] with an independent proof of the Complex Bounds Theorem. The method of [LS] is quite different; instead of a detailed combinatorial analysis it is based on specific numerical estimates for the real geometry. It does not address the phenomenon of big space. Also, the gap between [S] and [L2] was independently filled by Graczyk and Swiatek [GS2]. The method of the latter work is specifically adopted to essentially bounded but unbounded combinatorics. Note also that a related analysis of the big space phenomenon for real quadratics was independently carried out in [GS1].\n\n3. We were primarily concerned with the dynamics of quadratic maps, so we will only briefly dwell on the higher degree case. By replacing 2 to d, Theorem 1.1 extends to higher degree unimodal polynomials z ^ z d ^-c. On the other hand, by an appropriate adjustment of logic (see §8 of [L2]), the results of [L2] concerning a priori bounds also extend to the higher degree case (the first author noticed this after receiving a manuscript [LS] where the complex bounds for higher degree maps were proven in an essentially different manner). Thus the whole above discussion except growing of ^(p) is still valid for higher degrees.\n\n4. All the above results will actually be proven for maps ofEpstein class £\\ (see §4). In this case the quadratic-like extension with a definite modulus (independent of A) appears after skipping first N = N{\\) renormalization levels.\n\n5. Unimodal maps with essentially bounded combinatorics studied in this paper are closely related to critical circle maps. Indeed, high combinatorics for circle maps is always associated to saddle-node behavior (see [He]). Our method is well suited for the circle dynamics, and it was transferred to that setting by the second author [Y], who proved complex bounds for all critical circle maps. This complements the work of de Faria [F] where complex bounds were established for circle maps with bounded combinatorics.\n\nAcknowledgments. -The authors thank the referee for careful reading the manuscript and making many useful comments which led to a cleaner exposition. We also thank MSRI where part of this paper was written during the Hyperbolic Geometry and Dynamics spring term (1995) for its hospitality. This work was supported in part by the Sloan Research Fellowship and NSF grants DMS-8920768 (MSRI) and DMS-9022140.\n\nLetDy. = {z: \\z\\ <r}.\n\nWe use |J| for the length of an interval J, dist and diam for the Euclidean distance and diameter in C. Notation [a, b] stands for the (closed) interval with endpoints a and b without specifying their order.\n\nTwo sets X in Y in C are called K-commensurable or simply commensurable if K~1 < diamX/diamY < K with a constant K > 0 which may depend only on the specified combinatorial bounds.\n\nWe say that an annulus A has a definite modulus if mod A >_ 6 > 0, where 6 may also depend only on the specified combinatorial bounds.\n\nFor a pair of intervals I C J we say that I is contained well inside of J if for any of the components L of J \\ I, \\L\\ > K\\I\\ where the constant K > 0 may depend only on the specified quantifiers.\n\nA smooth interval map /: I -> I is called unimodal if it has a single critical point, and this point is an extremum. A C 3 unimodal map is called quasi-quadratic if it has negative Schwarzian derivative, and its critical point is non-degenerate.\n\nGiven a unimodal map / and a point x € J, x' will denote the dynamically symmetric point, that is, such that fx' = fx. Notation uj[z) = uJf(z) means as usual the limit set of the forward orbit {f^z}^^.\n\nSet Qc(z) = z 2 + c.\n\nGiven an interval J C R, let Cj = C\\(M\\J) denote the plane slit along two rays. Let Cj denote the completion of this domain in the path metric in Cj (which means that we add to Cj the banks of the slits).\n\nBy symmetry, J is a hyperbolic geodesic in Cj. The geodesic neighborhood of J of radius r is the set of all points in Cj whose hyperbolic distance to J is less than r. It is easy to see that such a neighborhood is the union of two M-symmetric segments of Euclidean disks based on J and having angle 6 = 0(r) with R. We will denote this hyperbolic disk by De (J) (see Figure 1). A particular example of a geodesic neighborhood of J is the Euclidean disk D(J) = D^/^{J).\n\nThese hyperbolic neighborhoods were introduced into the subject by Sullivan [S]. They are a key tool for getting complex bounds due to the following version of the Schwarz Lemma: SCHWARZ LEMMA. -Let us consider two intervals J' C R, J C R. Let (f) : Cj -> Cjf be an analytic map such that (j){J) C J'. Then for any ^(O.TO.^D^cW'). Let J = [a,&], a < b. For a point ^ € Cj, the an^/e between z and J, (2:, J) is the least of the angles between the intervals [a, z\\^ [&, ^] and the corresponding rays (-00, a], [b, +00) of the real line, measured in the range 0 < 0 <, TT.\n\nThe following consequence of the Schwarz Lemma will provide us a key to control the inverse branches expansion.\n\nLEMMA 2.1. -Under the circumstances of the Schwarz Lemma, assume that (j) admits a univalent extension (Cr,T) -^ (Cr^T'), where both components ofT \\ J have length 2p|J|. Let us consider a point z € Cj such that (z, J) > e. Then dist(<^, J') dist(^J)\n\n-j 1 -<C ^Jf or some constant C = (7(p, e).\n\nProof. -Let us normalize the situation in such a way: J = J' = [0,1]. Since the space of univalent maps normalized at two points is compact (by the Koebe Theorem), the statement is true if dist(^, J) < p. So assume that dist(^, J) > p.\n\nFigure 1 Observe that the smallest (closed) geodesic neighborhood clDe (J) enclosing z satisfies: diamD^J) < C{e) dist(^, J) (cf. Figure 1). Indeed, if 6 > ^e then diam-D^(J) < (7(e), which is fine since dist(z, J) > p.\n\nOtherwise the intervals [0, z] and [1, z] cut out segments of angle size at least e on the appropriate circle arc of 9Do (J). Hence the lengths of these intervals are commensurable with diamD^J) (with a constant depending on e). On the other hand, these lengths are at most (1 + p -l )dist(^,J), provided that dist(^, J) > p\\J\\.\n\nTogether with the Schwarz Lemma this yields: dist((^,J') ^ dlam(De (J f )) = diam(^(J)) < C(p,e)dist(^J), and the claim follows. D\n\nIn the next lemma we collect for further reference some elementary properties of the square root map. Let (f){z) = ^/z be the branch of the square root mapping the slit plane C \\ R_ into itself.\n\n• Let 0 denote the angle between [^, a] and the ray of the real line which does not contain J\\ ?/ denote the angle between [C'?^7] ^d the corresponding ray of the real line. If0< ^ TT then r]' > ^ TT.\n\n(According to our convention, in the last statement we don't assume that a < b.)\n\nLet 0 G U' C U C C be two topological disks different from the whole plane, and /: U' -> U be an analytic double branched covering map with critical point at 0. Let B denote the space of such double branched coverings.\n\nFor / e B, the filled Julia set K(f) is naturally defined as the set of non-escaping points of /, K(f) = Q f^U, and the Julia set is defined n>0 as its boundary, J(f) = 9K(f). These sets are not necessarily compact and may change as the map is restricted to a smaller topological disk V (such that this restriction is still a map of class B). The Julia set (and the filled Julia set) are connected if and only if the critical point itself is non-escaping, 0 G K(f).\n\nIf additionally cl U' C U then the map / is called quadratic-like. If the Julia set J(f) of a quadratic-like map is connected then it does not change as the map is restricted to a smaller domain V (such that this restriction is still quadratic-like), see [McM], Thm 5.11. Moreover, the Julia set of a quadratic-like map is compact, and this is actually the criterion for admitting a quadratic-like restriction: LEMMA 2.4 (compare [McM2], Prop. 4.10). -Let U' C U be two topological disks^ and f : V -»• U be a double branched covering with nonescaping critical point and compact Julia set. Then there are topological discs\n\nProof. -Let us consider the topological annulus A = U \\ K(g). Let 0: A -> R = {z: 1 < \\z\\ < r} be its uniformization by a round annulus. It conjugates g to a map G: R' ->• R where R' is a subannulus of R with the same inner boundary, unit circle S 1 . As G is proper near the unit circle, it is continuously extended to it, and then can be reflected to the symmetric annulus. We obtain a double covering map G: R' -> R of the symmetric annuli preserving the circle. Moreover R is a round annulus of modulus at least 2c.\n\nLet {. denote the hyperbolic metric on R, V denote the hyperbolic 1-neighborhood of 5 1 , and\n\nWe obtain now the desired domains by going back to U'.\n\nLet us supply the space B of double branched coverings with the Caratheodory topology (see [McMl]). Convergence of a sequence fn'-U^ ->• Un in this topology means Caratheodory convergence of (£/n,0) and (£7^, 0), and compact-open convergence of fn'\n\nLet us consider a quasi-quadratic interval map /: I = [/3, /3'] ->• J with /(/3') = /(/?) == /?, where /? is a non-attracting fixed point: /'(/3) ^ 1. By definition, / belongs to Epstein class (see [E], [S]) if it admits an analytic extension to a double branched covering /: U' ->• U such that U = CT and V is an R-symmetric topological disk meeting the real line along an interval T' containing I. (For reasons which will become clear in §2.6 we do not assume that T' C T.) Any map / in Epstein class admits a representation\n\nwhere (f): U' -^ A(<^) is a univalent map onto the complex plane with four slits, which double covers Cr under the quadratic map Qc :z »-> z 2 + c. As the range A(0) is determined by T and c, we will also denote it as A^c-For purely notational convenience we will also assume the maps / of the Epstein class to be even: f{z) = f(-z). Then the map (j) is odd, and the intervals J, T' and the domain U 9 are symmetric about 0. Moreover, the interval T and hence the domain U = Cr can also be assumed symmetric: just shrink T to make it symmetric and adjust T' accordingly.\n\nRemark. -Of course, all the maps of Epstein class associated to a quadratic map (restricted iterates of a quadratic map) are automatically symmetric. To carry the argument through in the non-symmetric case, one should just observe that the dynamical involution z I-?-2/5 f(z) = f{z'\\ has bounded distortion on compact subsets of U.\n\nLet £ stand for the Epstein class modulo affine conjugacy (that is, rescaling of Z). We will always normalize / G £ so that 0 is its critical point.\n\nGiven a p > 1, let ^p C £ denote the space of maps of Epstein class modulo affine conjugacy such that |T| > p\\I\\.\n\nLEMMA 2.5. -For any p > 0, the space £ p is Caratheodory compact.\n\nProof. -Let us normalize a map / in £ p so that I = [-1,1], /? = 1. Then T D [-Pip}-Moreover, since the modulus of the topological annulus CT \\ I is at most twice the modulus of Cy/ \\ J, T\" D [-p', p'} with p' > 1 depending only on p. Since the critical value c divides T into two intervals of length at least p -1, the range A(0) = Aj^c covers the disk D^ with Let us now have a sequence fn = Qcn ° ^n of normalized maps of Epstein class (2.1). Clearly we can select a subsequence such that the slit domains CT^ and A(<^n) Caratheodory converge respectively to some Cr and Ar,c, where T D [-p, p] and Ar,c ^ ^r' Moreover, since Qc(<f>nl) C [-1,1], we have: \\(f)nl\\ < : 2\\/2, so that we can make (f)nl converge to some interval J = [-a, a]. This interval is contained in AT,C, since the intervals <^J are well inside A((^).\n\nSince 0n(/3) ^ \\/2 and /^(/3) > 1, <^(/3) stays away from 0. So, the points 0n/3 -^ a stay definite distance from the boundary of Ar,c and (^n 1 )'^^) are bounded from above. By the Koebe Theorem, the family of univalent maps 0^1 is normal on A^c-Let us select a subsequence 0^1 uniformly converging on compact subsets of Aj^c-Since (f)nl are intervals of bounded length staying away from the boundary of Aj^c, the limit of the (f>^1 is non-constant, and hence is a univalent function (f)~1. It follows that the domains U'^ of the maps (f)n Caratheodory converge to V = (^A^c-Let us now observe that by the Koebe Theorem, the sequence of direct functions (f)n is normal on any domain fl, D I compactly contained in U'. Indeed, this is a family of univalent functions bounded on J, with the derivatives <^(/?) bounded away from 0. It follows that (f)n -^ (f> uniformly on compact sets of V.\n\nSince Cn ->• c, we conclude that fn -f -Qc ° <t>-D\n\nThe above proof also yields:\n\nLEMMA 2.6. -Given a p > 1, there is a domain Op D [-1,1] with the following property. For any f € £ p normalized so that I = [-1,1], the univalent map ^ in (2.1) is well-defined and has bounded distortion on Op. Moreover^ in scale e the distortion oKf) is bounded by C(p)e.\n\nWe will refer to the above property by saying that / is a quadratic map up to bounded distortion. The last statement (which certainly follows from the Koebe Distortion Theorem) shows, in particular, that in some scale e depending only on p the distortion of 0 is bounded by 2.\n\nWe will mostly be concerned with a subset of Epstein maps specified by a stronger condition. Given a A E (0,1), let £\\ C £ be space of maps of Epstein class modulo affine conjugacy such that T' C T and each component J of T \\ T' is A -1 -commensurable with T'. Note that there exists A C (0,1), such that all real quadratics Qc, c € [-2, ^], belong to the Epstein class £\\ (with T selected as a fixed large 0-symmetric interval).\n\nLEMMA 2.7. -Given a A € (0,1), let f C £\\ and [-1,1] = I C T\" C T be as above:\n\n• the space £\\ is Caratheodory compact;\n\n• both T and T' are K(\\)-commensurable with J, and I is contained well inside T';\n\n• denote by JJ 1 , i = 1,2, the components of (/^^(T \\ T'). Iff is not close to the cusp then \\J^\\ is K(X)-commensurable with dist(J^, 91).\n\nProof. -As £\\ is a closed subset of some £ p ^x\\ the first property follows from Lemma 2.5. Furthermore, there exists JLA = /^(A) > 0 such that the annulus A = D(T) \\ D(T') has modulus at least u,. Since mod^^A) = 2-n /A(A), there exist Kn = Kn(\\) such that |J?|> Kn\\T\\T / \\. Using the fact that both components of T \\ T' are A -1 -commensurable with \\T'\\ we have |Jf| > Ln\\T'\\. As J, 1 are contained in T'\\I, \\I\\/\\T'\\ is bounded from above.\n\nSet T\" = [7', 7] = (/IR)\"^' where 7 lies on the same side of 0 as the fixed point f3 = 1. Commensurability of the J^ with T' and Koebe Distortion Theorem imply that (f) in (2.1) has a (7(A)-bounded distortion on this interval. Hence\n\nSince Jf is commensurable with T\", the length of T' must be bounded. Thus I is commensurable with T\" (and T).\n\nTo prove the last statement, let us consider the interval S =[-/?, 7]. Bounded distortion of (j)\\S and elementary distortion properties of the quadratic map imply that / has bounded distortion on 6'. By compactness of £\\, for f C £\\ which is not close to the cusp the multiplier of /? is bounded away from 1. Moreover, we can take a point a e (/?, 7) which divides (/?, 7) into J<r(A)-commensurable parts and such that f(x) > q = q(X) > 1 for x € (/?,a). Let J 71 = J? stand for the intervals lying on the side of the fixed point {3 C 91. Then only bounded number of intervals J 71 may be outside (/?, a). For the rest of them, \\J n \\^(q-l) dist (J 71 , (3) which finishes the proof of the lemma. D\n\nAll maps in this paper will be assumed to belong to the Epstein class £.\n\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of renormalization in one-dimensional dynamics (see e.g., [MS]).\n\nLet / be k times renormalizable quasi-quadratic map, 0 <: k <_ oo. For t <, fc, let the closed interval P^ 3 0 be a central periodic interval corresponding to the ^-fold renormalization R^f of /, ne be its period: ji •= f^'.P^ -^ P^. Let Pf be the component of f-^-^pĉ ontaining f'Q. These intervals always have disjoint interiors. We say that the intervals Pf, i = 0,1,... ,n^ -1, form the cycle of level i. Note that the periodic interval P^ is not canonically defined. Possible choices are p^ = B^ = [/3e,f3^\\ where /^ is the an appropriate fixed point of /^; andP^=[/,0,/M By definition, the ^-fold renormalization R^f is equal to f^P^ up to the choice of P t and rescaling. To be definite, we will assume that it is normalized so that B^ is rescaled to [-1,1]: R'f(z) = <T 1 /^), where q = ^|.\n\nLet pi = 7^/7^-1 be the relative periods, pk(f) = max pi. We say that an K(.<k infinitely renormalizable map / has bounded combinatorics if the sequence of relative periods is bounded.\n\nIf HI = 2 then / is called immediately renormalizable, and the corresponding renormalization is called doubling. In this case the maximal periodic intervals P 1 = [/?i, f3[] and P^ touch at their common fixed point /3i (which coincides with the fixed point a of / with negative multiplier). In all other cases the periodic intervals P^ are disjoint.\n\nBesides /3^, the quasi-quadratic map ff, has one more fixed point on Bŵ hich will be denoted by o^. At the cusp {i.e., when fi(f3e) = 1) these two points coincide. Note that if i < k (so that R^f is renormalizable), then f'^i) < -1-Let S[ D Pf be the maximal interval such that the restriction of / n ^-1 to it is monotone. Set T^ = f^-^Si) and S^ = f-^Si). Then ji: S^ ->• T^ is a unimodal map.\n\nLet us now state some basic geometric properties of infinitely renormalizable maps usually referred to as real bounds (see [G], [BL1], [BL2], [S], [MS] for the proofs). Below we assume that / is a k times renormalizable quasi-quadratic map of Epstein class £\\, 0 < k < oo.\n\nLEMMA 2.8. -For a quasi-quadratic map f € £\\ as above:\n\n• The interval P k is well inside T^ and 5^. Moreover, after skipping initial N(\\) levels^ the space in between these intervals becomes absolute (i.e., independent of A).\n\n• The renormalizations R 1 ^ f belong to some class E 7 ' with r = r^(A) < r(A) < 1 which becomes absolute after skipping the initial N{\\) levels.\n\n• If Ok has negative multiplier then 5^ C T^.\n\n• If f'(ak) <: -e < 0 then 5^ is well inside T k (with the space depending on e).\n\nProof. -The first statement is proven in the above quoted works (see e.g., [MS], Lemma VI.2.1). The second statement is the consequence of the first one.\n\nLet us consider the component J of S k \\ (/3,/3') containing f3. If gk ^ rpk ^^ j-^ monotonically maps J into itself. Hence it has an attracting fixed point 7 € J with positive multiplier. Since the critical point is attracted by the cycle of 7, 7 belongs to some interval P^. It follows that R k f also has an attracting fixed point with positive multiplier contradicting the assumption. This proves the third statement.\n\nThe last statement follows by compactness of £ p . D LEMMA 2.9. -The map / nfc-l : P^ -^ P k , 0 < i < n^, of a noncentral interval onto the central one is a diffeomorphism whose distortion is bounded by an absolute constant.\n\nLet G^ be the gaps of level fc, that is the components of P^~1 \\ UP^. Geometry of / is said to be 6-bounded (up to level n) if there is a choice of periodic intervals P^, such that for any intervals P^, G^ C P^~1, we have: IP^I/I?^\" 1 ! > S and |G^|/|P^-1 ! > ^ A; = 1,... ,n. In other words, all the intervals and the gaps of level k contained in some interval of level k -1 are commensurable with the latter.\n\nLet p be an upper bound on the essential periods of the first k renormalizations of /: pi(f) < p, i = 0,1,..., A;. THEOREM 2.10. -Any map f as above has a 6-bounded geometry, where 8 depends only on p. In particular, infinitely renormalizable maps with bounded combinatorics have bounded geometry.\n\nCOROLLARY 2.11. -Let P^ be a non-central interval which belongs to the central interval P^\" 1 . Then the map f nk ~^: P^ -> P k has a derivative bounded away from 0 and oo by constants depending on p only.\n\nProof. -Indeed, by Theorem 2.10, the intervals P^ and P^ are commensurable, while by Lemma 2.9, the map between them has a bounded distortion. D COROLLARY 2.12. -Let f(ak) ^ -e < 0. Then 6^ is K(p)commensurable with T^, and the renormalization R^^f belongs to some class <?^, with ^ depending only on A, p and e.\n\nProof. -Given the last statement of Lemma 2.8, we only need to show that IS^I/IT^I is bounded from below. But 5^ C P^\" 1 , since the map fk = /^_i is 0-symmetric and at least 3-modal on P^\" 1 . As P^-1 is /A-invariant, T^ C P^\" 1 as well. As by Theorem 2.10 P^ and P^\" 1 are K (^-commensurable, we are done. D\n\nLet us state a result which gives an estimate of the modulus of a quadratic-like map after one renormalization: THEOREM 2.13 (see [L2], Cor. 5.6). -Let f be a renormalizable quadratic-like map with mod/ > p > 0. Then Rf is also quadratic-like, and mod Rf > 6(p) > 0 unless the renormalization is a doubling and Rf is close to the cusp.\n\nA fundamental annulus A of a renormalization R^^f is called unbranched if A n o;y(0) = 0. LEMMA 2.14 (see [L2], Lemma 9.3). -Let f be an infinitely renormalizable R-symmetric quadratic-like map with a priori bounds. Then every other renormalization R 71 / has an unbranched fundamental annulus with a definite modulus {depending on a priori bounds only).\n\nLet / be a renormalizable quasi-quadratic map.\n\nRecall that (3 = /?o and a stand for the fixed points of / with positive and negative multipliers correspondingly.\n\nIf / is immediately renormalizable then A is a periodic interval with period 2. Otherwise let us consider the principal nest A = 1° = I°(f) D I 1 = J^/) D ... of intervals of / (see [LI]). It is defined in the following way. Let t[m) be the first return time of the orbit of 0 back to J^-1 . Then 1^ is defined as the component of f-Wjm-i containing 0.\n\nFor m > 1, let n ' I I /' m -). r 71 -1 9m ' ^J1 ! ^ 1 be the generalized renormalization of / on the interval J 771 \" 1 , that is, the first return map restricted onto the intervals intersecting the postcritical set (here / m = J^)-Note that gm = / t(m) : 1^ -^ I 171 ' 1 is unimodal with ^(ar 71 ) C QI 171 -1 , while gm : 1^ -^ ^m-l is a diffeomorphism for all i ^ 0.\n\nLet us consider the following set of levels:\n\nA level m = m(k) belongs to X iff the return to level (m -1) is non-central^ that is gm0 ^ J 7n-l \\J m . For such a moment the map ^m+ilj 7 ^1 is essentially different from ^ml^ (that is not just the restriction of the latter to a smaller domain). Let us use the notation hk = ^m(fc)+i5 ^ = ^ • • • X-The number \\ = ^(/) is called the height of /. (In the immediately renormalizable case set \\ = -1.)\n\nThe nest of intervals under the corresponding inverse map). Clearly, ^jn(fc)+z+i ^ mapped by hk onto ^m(fe)+l , i = 1,..., m(k +1) -m(k) -1, while ^m^+ l = j^^1 are mapped onto the whole J^). This family of intervals is called the Markov family associated with the central cascade.\n\nThis parameter shows how deep the orbit of x lands inside the cascade. Let us now define dk as the maximum of d{x) over all ^e^n^Wv 771 ^1).\n\nGiven a saddle-node cascade (3.1), let us call neglectable all levels m{k) + dk < t < m(k + 1) -dk.\n\nLet us now define the essential period pe = Pe(f)-Let p be the period of the periodic interval J = B{Rf). Let us remove from the orbit {f k J} J kâ ll the intervals whose first return to some I^W belongs to a neglectable level. The essential period is the number of the intervals which are left.\n\nWe say that an infinitely renormalizable map / has essentially bounded combinatorics if sup^pg^7 1 /) < oo.\n\nRemark. -Bounded essential period is equivalent to a bound on the following combinatorial factors: the height, the return times of the J^1 to jm-i m^er iterates of gm-i^ the lengths of the Ulam-Neumann cascades, and the depths dk of landing at the saddle-node cascades. THEOREM 3.1 (see [L2], Thm V).\n\nLet a(f) = \\B(Rf)\\/\\B(f)\\. Let us say that / has essentially bounded geometry if inf^ a^R 1 ' 1 /) > 0.\n\nBy the gaps G^ of level m we mean the components ofI lm ~l\\ UJJ 71 . We say that a level m is deep inside the cascade if m(k}-{-pe < m < m(k-{-l)-pe.\n\nThe following lemma says that the maps with essentially bounded combinatorics have essentially bounded geometry (the inverse is true by Theorem 3.1). LEMMA 3.2 (see [L2], Lemma 8.8). -Let f C £\\ be a renormalizable quasi-quadratic map with pe{f) < : Pe' Then all the intervals I 171 in the principal nest off are C{pe, \\)-commensurable. Moreover, the non-central intervals J^, i -^ 0, and the gaps G^ of level m are G(pe? \\)-commensurable with J 771 -1 \\ J 771 . This is also true for the central interval J 771 , provided m is not deep inside the cascade.\n\nNote that the last statement of the lemma is definitely false when m is deep inside a cascade: then J 771 occupies almost the whole of I 771 ' 1 . So we observe commensurable intervals in the beginning and in the end of the cascade, but not in the middle. This is the saddle-node phenomenon which is in the focus of this work. COROLLARY 3.3. -Let f e £\\ be a renormalizable quasi-quadratic map with pe{f) < pe such that Rf is not close to the cusp. Then Rf e ŵith p = p(A,pg). If Rf has no attracting fixed points then Rf e S^, with ^=/^(A,pe).\n\nProof. -In view of Lemmas 2.8 and 3.2 it is enough to notice that jm(x-i) 3 r 1 D S 1 -^ J^^1 where x = x{f) is the height of / (compare Corollary 2.12). D\n\nThe following important distortion result will replace Lemma 2.9 in the case of unbounded combinatorics: THEOREM 3.4 (see [GJ], [Ma]). -For any quasi-quadratic map /, the return map gm : ^m+l -> I 171 is a composition of the quadratic map z ^ z 2 and a map h with bounded distortion. Moreover^ h~1 has a definite Koebe extension around J 771 .\n\nThe following two statements extend Corollary 2.11 to the case of essentially bounded combinatorics. COROLLARY 3.5. -Let f be a quasi-quadratic map with pe(f) < pe'\n\n• For a non-central interval ij 1 ^1 c I^W \\ J^^1 the derivative of the restriction h^rmw+i is bounded away from 0 and oo.\n\n• For any m{k) < £ < s < m(k + 1), which are not deep inside the cascade, the derivative of the transition map h^'.I^I^1^!^!^1 is bounded away from 0 and oo.\n\nThe constants depend only on pe.\n\nProof. -By Lemma 3.2, any non-central interval / m(A;)+l is commensurable to its distance to 0. Hence the quadratic map has bounded distortion on jj 7 ^^1 . By Theorem 3.4, the return map gm : ^m+l -^ 1^ has bounded distortion as well. Since its domain and range are commensurable (by Lemma 3.2 again), we see that its derivative is bounded away from 0 and oo. Furthermore, the Koebe Principle easily implies that the transition map along the cascade has bounded distortion. Hence by essentially bounded geometry, it must have bounded derivative. D COROLLARY 3.6. -Under the assumptions of the previous corollary, let f be renormalizable. Let Pi C r^+i)\\j\"^+2) be a non-central periodic interval. Consider its first return /\"P, = P^s bade to J^^1). Then P^s is K(pe)-commensurable with Pi. This is also true for the intermediate returns to I^W^ that is the intervals P^j satisfying 0 < j < s and P^j C I 171 \\ I^1 with m(k) <m<_ m(k +!)+!, provided m is not deep inside the cascade.\n\nProof. -The first statement follows from the previous lemma.\n\nThe second statement follows in a similar way from Theorem 3.4 and the second part of Corollary 3.5. D\n\nIn this section we will state the Main Lemmas and will derive all the results from them. The lemmas will be proven in the following sections. As everything will be done in the setting of the Epstein class, let us start with the corresponding version of Theorem 1.1. THEOREM 4.1. -For any \\ € (0,1) there exists N = N(\\) with the following property. Let f € £\\ be an n-times renormalizable map, N <, n < oo. Let max pe^f) <Pe.\n\nThen R'^f has a quadratic-like extension with mod(JR 71 /) > ii{pe) > 0, unless the last renormalization is of doubling type and R^f is close to the cusp.\n\nLet P^, fk = / nfc , etc. be as in §2.6. Set S = 5°, T = T°, so that /: S -> T is unimodal. Let us consider the decomposition:\n\nwhere ^ is a univalent map from a neighborhood U 1 ^ of Pf onto Cyfc.\n\nLEMMA 4.2. -Let f : [-1,1] -^ [-1,1] be ak times renormalizable quasi-quadratic map of Epstein class £\\. Assume that pe(R i f) <: pe for £ = 0,1,..., k -1. Then there exist C = C(pe) > 0 and t = t(\\,pe) C N, such that for all z € P(r*) H Cyfc the following estimate holds:\n\nThus the maps ^1 after appropriate rescaling (that is normalizing jpfej ^ jp^cj ^ ^ ^^ ^ j^g^ linear growth depending on A and p only. This implies, in particular, that for sufficiently big £ (depending on A and pe only), ^^(DiT^)) is contained in the range where / -1 is the square root map up to bounded distortion (see Lemma 2.6). This yields the quadratic estimate (1.1) stated in the Introduction:\n\n(«) ^y ><^p) 2 . .^.rw^, where c and £ depend only on p and A. COROLLARY 4.3. -Under the circumstances of Lemma 4.2, there exists N == 7V(A,pe) with the following property. For any k > N, fk : P^ -> P^ admits a quadratic-like extension whose little Julia set is K(pe) -commensurable with the interval P^.\n\nProof. -The above estimate (4.3) implies that for a sufficiently large r we have 1/^(^)1 > 2|^|, provided dist^^),?^ > rIP^. By real bounds there exists s depending only on A and pe, such that dist(C, P^) > P-IP^ for k > s + t and any < e QD^-8 ).\n\nSet V k = D^-8 ) HC^, A^ = (M^)-1 ^. Then by the above estimate, 9^ cannot touch QD^T^8). Neither can it touch T^8 \\ T k since 9^ nR= S k . Hence A^ is compactly contained in V k , so that the restriction / nfe : A^ -^ V^ is quadratic-like. Its little Julia set is contained in DiT^8) which is commensurable with P k . D\n\nCarrying the argument for Lemma 4.2 further, we will prove the following result: LEMMA 4.4. -Under the circumstances of the previous lemma^ the little Julia set J(fk) (for the quadratic-like extension of fk : P^ -^ P^) is contained in the hyperbolic disk D^B 1 ^)^ where e > 0 depends only on pg, unless the k-th renormalization is of doubling type and R k f is close to the cusp.\n\nProof of Theorem 4.1. -Choose N as in Corollary 4.3. Let us assume first that R k f does not have an attracting fixed point. Then by Lemma 2.8, B 1 ^ is well inside of T k . Hence the hyperbolic disk D^B^ is well inside the slit plane C^k. By Lemma 4.4, the Julia set J(I? 71 /) is also well inside C^k, and the desired follows from Lemma 2.4.\n\nIf R k f has an attracting cycle, let us go one level up. As -R^\" 1 / does not have attracting points, it has a definite modulus. By Theorem 2.13 its first renormalization, R k f^ also has a definite modulus, unless it is of doubling type and close to the cusp. D\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. -For n > N the claim follows from Theorem 4.1. As mod/ = oo for any quadratic polynomial /, for all preceding levels n <^ N we have bounds by Theorem 2.13. D\n\nThe statement of the Complex Bounds Theorem needs an obvious adjustment for maps of Epstein class (where one should skip first N(\\) levels), or for quadratic-like maps (where the bounds depend on mod(/)). Note also that due to the Straightening Theorem (see [DH], [McMl]), the latter case follows from the quadratic one.\n\nProof of the Complex Bounds Theorem. -By Lemma 2.8, all the renormalizations -R 171 /, N(\\) <: m < fc, belong to a class £e with an absolute 6. Without loss of generality we can assume that N(\\) = 0 (taking into account Theorem 2.13 in the quadratic-like case). Take a /^ > 0, e.g. u, = 1. By Theorem 3.1, there is a p = p{p) such that mod(.R/) > fi for all renormalizable maps / of Epstein class £e with Pe(f) ^ P' So we have complex bounds for all renormalizations R^^f such that pe^R^f) > P-For all intermediate levels we have bounds by Theorem 2.13 and Theorem 4.1 (except perhaps for the first N levels with an absolute N = N{0)).\n\nThe latter bounds depend on p. But with the choice ji = 1, p and hence the bounds are absolute. D\n\nNow the Complex Bounds Theorem and Lemma 2.14 yield:\n\nLEMMA 4.5. -Let f e £\\. Then for every other level k > N(\\), the renormalization J?^/ has an unbranched fundamental annulus with a definite modulus.\n\nBy a puzzle piece we mean a topological disk bounded by rational external rays and equipotentials (compare [H], [L2], [Ml]).\n\nProof of the Local Connectivity Theorem. -By [HJ], [J], [McM2], unbranched a priori bounds imply local connectivity of the Julia set. For the sake of completeness we will supply the argument below.\n\nFor now, / is an infinitely renormalizable map of class £\\. Since quadratic-like maps (considered up to rescaling) with a priori bounds form a compact family, the Julia set K(g) depends upper semi-continuously on g, and the /^fixed point depends continuously on the map (see [McMl], §4, for all these properties), the little Julia sets J(fk) are commensurable with the intervals B k . Hence the J(fk) shrink to the critical point. By the Douady and Hubbard renormalization construction (see [D], [L2], [McM2]), each little Julia set is the intersection of a nest of puzzle pieces. As each of these pieces contains a connected part of the Julia set, J{f) is locally connected at the critical point.\n\nLet us now prove local connectivity at any other point z € J(f) (by a standard \"spreading around\" argument). Take a puzzle piece V 3 0. The set of points which never visit V, Yy = [C,: ^C, ^ V, n = 0,1,...}, is expanding. (Cover this set by finitely many non-critical puzzle pieces, thicken them a bit, and use the fact the branches of the inverse map are contracting with respect to the Poincare metric in these pieces.) It follows that if z € Yy then there is a nest of puzzle pieces shrinking to z, and we are done.\n\nLet now z ^ Yy, for any critical puzzle piece V. Take an unbranched level k. Then there is a puzzle piece V k D J(fk) with a definite space in between it and the rest of the postcritical set. Take the first moment ŝuch that f^z € V 1 ^. Then there exists a single-valued inverse branch /\"^ : C(i_(_g)j3fc -f C whose image contains z (where e depends on A only).\n\nFurthermore, there is an r C (0,1) depending on A only such that the hyperbolic disk ^k in C^^k of radius r (centered at 0) contains V k . Moreover, by the Koebe Theorem this disk has a bounded shape.\n\nUsing the Koebe Theorem once more, we see that the f~e' k have a bounded distortion on f^. Hence the pullbacks V k = /\"^f^ have a bounded distortion as well. As they cannot contain a disk of a definite radius (as any disk B{z, e) must cover the whole Julia set under some iterate of /), we conclude that diam [/ fe -^ 0. All the more, the pullbacks of the V k under /\"^ shrink. This is the desired nest of puzzle pieces about z.\n\nWe first prove the complex bounds in the case when the map / has bounded combinatorics. The result is well-known in this case [MS], [S], but we give a quite simple proof which will be then generalized onto the case of essentially bounded combinatorics.\n\nGiven an interval T C R let /: U' -^ CT be a map of Epstein class.\n\nFor a point x € RfW which is not critical for / n , let Vn(x) = Vn(x, f) denote the maximal domain containing x which is univalently mapped by / n onto Or. Its intersection with the real line is the monotonicity interval Hn{x) = Hn(x,f) of / n containing x. Let f^'. CT -^ Vn(x) denote the corresponding inverse branch of / -n (continuous up to the boundary of the slits, with different values on the different banks). If J is an interval on which / n is monotone, then the notations Vn (J) and Hn (J) and /J 71 make an obvious sense.\n\nTake an x € R and a z € Cr. If we have a backward orbit of x = a;o,^-i,... ^x-(. of x which does not contain 0, the corresponding backward orbit z = ZQ^ ^-i,..., z-i is obtained by applying the appropriate branches of the inverse functions: z-n = fx^' ^ne same terminology is applied when we have a monotone pullback J = Jo? • • • 5 J-£ of an interval J.\n\nLet H D J be two intervals. Let Se^{H^ J) denote the union of two 2e-wedges with vertices at 9J (symmetric with respect to the real line) cut off by the neighborhood De (H) (see Figure 3).\n\nLet Ce(J) denote the complement of the above two wedges (that is, the set of points looking at J at an angle at least e).\n\nWe are ready to carry out the inductive proof of (5.2). Let j be the smallest level for which (5.3) ZQ € D(f 3 ).\n\nBy Lemma 5.3, either z-n, e D^f 3 ), or z-n, e-jumps. Moreover, in the latter case |^-nJ < C\\ZQ\\, and the map ^-1 from (4.1) admits a univalent extension to Cyj. So Lemma 2.1 yields (5.2).\n\nIn the former case we will proceed inductively. Assume that either z-m € Z)(T^'~1), or z-t e-jumps at some good moment -t ^ -un. If the latter happens, we are done. If the former happens, we pass to t + 1 by Corollary 5.5. Lemma 4.2 is proved (for bounded combinatorics). D\n\nWe will show here that J(fk) C De^) which is sufficient for applications (see also §7.2). By Corollary 4.3, diamJ(/fc) < Cl^l, with a C = C{p). Hence J(fk) C D(r^), where i > k -N(p). Let C' € J(A), C = AC', and ^ = ^o,C-i,...,C-n = C 7 be the corresponding backward orbit under iterates of/^. By Lemma 5.3, either C-j e-jumps at some moment, or C 7 € D^T^. If the former happens then (-j e De (J-jne), where 6 = 0{e) > 0, and J-rn are the intervals from (5.1). But then by the Schwarz Lemma C' ^ De'^) with some 0' depending on A and p only. Thus J(fk) C De^P^ U D^), and we are done.\n\nLet / € £\\ be a map of Epstein class.\n\nLet us note first that for a long saddle-node cascade (3.1), the map hk: r 71 ^)4 \" 1 -^ j^i(^) is a small perturbation of a map with a parabolic fixed point. LEMMA 6.1 (see [L2]). -Let hk be a sequence of maps of Epstein class E\\ having saddle-node cascades of length ^ -^ oo. Then any limit point f : I' -^ I of this sequence (in the Caratheodory topology) has on the real line topological type ofz^z 2 -^ \\, and thus has a parabolic fixed point.\n\nProof. -It takes £k iterates for the critical point to escape r 71 ^)-^1 under iterates of hk. Hence the critical point does not escape I' under iterates of /. By the kneading theory [MT], / has on the real line topological type of z 2 +c with -2 < c < \\. Since small perturbations of / have escaping critical point, the choice for c boils down to only two boundary parameter values, ^ and -2. Since the cascades of hk are of saddle-node type, fl' ^ 0, which rules out c == -2. Q Remark 6.1. -Thus the plane dynamics of hk with a long saddle node cascade resembles the dynamics of a map with a parabolic fixed point: the orbits follow horocycles (see Figure 5). Proof. -To be definite, let us assume that the intervals E-i lie on the left of 0 (see Figure 2). Without loss of generality, we can assume that z € HI. Let (f) = h^1 be the inverse branch of hk for which (f)E-i = £_^n. As 0 is orientation preserving on (-00, fa^O], it maps the upper half-plane HI into itself: <^(HI) c {z = re' 0 \\ r > 0, TT > 0 > JTI-}. By Lemma 6.1, if the cascade (3.1) is sufficiently long, the map <f) has an attracting fixed point 77^ C B D D^I^^^2) (which is a perturbation of the parabolic point for some map of type z 2 + ^). By the Denjoy-Wolf Theorem, ^(C) ---> ^ fof any ^ G H, uniformly on compact subsets n->oo of El. Thus for a given compact set K (c= B, there exists A7' = A7'(J<T, 0) such that ^{K) C ^(J 771 ^^1 ). By a normality argument, the choice of N is actually independent of a particular 0 under consideration. By Lemma 2.2 the set K = ^(D^W)) \\ D^W) H El is compactly contained in El, and diamJC < C}!^^. For TV as above we have\n\n) ), and the lemma is proved. D %=o\n\nThe case of essentially bounded combinatorics is more involved than the bounded case treated above ( §5). Above we needed only quite rough combinatorial information in between two consecutive renormalization levels. Below we will need to pull the point more carefully through the principal nest waiting until it jumps. A difficulty arises if the jump occurs at a \"bad\" moment. Then the corresponding iterate of the periodic interval is deep inside of a cascade and hence is not commensurable with its original size. The analysis of saddle-node behavior given in §6 will allow us to handle this problem.\n\nIn view of Lemma 2.8, we can assume without loss of generality that all the renormalizations R^f, £ = 0,..., k -1, belong to a class £\\ with an absolute A. Let us start with a little lemma: Let z e D(r*) n Cr^ with sufficiently big t = t(\\). Let (7.2) Z =E 2^0, 2;-!, ^-2, • . . , ^-(n-1)\n\nbe the backward orbit of z corresponding to the orbit (7.1). We should prove that (7^ dist(^_i),J_^_i)) ^ dist(zo,Jo)\n\nWe will proceed inductively along the principal nest. Namely, we will show below that the backward ^-orbit (7.2) either e-jumps at some good moment, or follows the backward J-orbit (7.1) with at most one level delay.\n\nIn what follows we work with a fixed renormalization level I and skip index I in the notations: / = fi = ^(/o), S = S^ A = A^B ==E B< We will use notations of §3 for different combinatorial objects. Let Hs(x) be the monotonicity intervals as defined in §5.1. Proof. -By definition of the essential period, s < pe-Note that the interval /^(fi') is contained well inside 5'. By the Schwarz Lemma and Lemma 2.2, if a point (,-i ^ D{S), then it e-jumps. Combining Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 2.6 we see that (7.4) holds up to the first moment -i when ^-ê -jumps.\n\nBy Lemma 7.1 each component of B \\ A contains an /-preimage of 0 which divides B into X-commensurable intervals, with K = K{pe). Hence the monotonicity interval of /, H = Hs(E-s)^ is well inside of B. As f :B -> B has an extension of Epstein class ^p,(\\) (Corollary 2.12), we can apply Lemma 5.2. It follows that if none of the points <^ e-jumps, then C-z (E De{H\\ 0 > -i > -5, with 6 = ^TT -0(e). Thus C-. € D(B) for sufficiently small e < e(pe)^ and the proof is completed. D\n\nOur last lemma takes care of the case when the map fn is immediately renormalizable.\n\nLEMMA 7.7 (To the next renormalization level: period 2 case). -Assume that ji is immediately renormalizable, so that A^ == B^. Let E C ^+1 , E = EQ, £'_!,..., E-s = E' be the consecutive returns of the backward orbit (7.1) to B^ until the first return to A^.\n\nLet ^ = (^o,..., C-s = C' be the corresponding points of the backward orbit (7.2). Assume also that C e CA^ n D{B^). Then either <' e ^(B^1), or (C-^E^) > e and dist(C-z, ^-z) < C(pe)|^| for some 0 > -z > -5. Moreover, all these moments are good.\n\nProof. -By essentially bounded combinatorics, s < 2pe which yields the last statement.\n\nFurther, by Lemma 7.1, the monotonicity interval Hs{E-s^fe) is contained well inside of ^^+1 , and the claim follows from Lemma 5.2. D\n\nLet us now summarize the above information. When fr-i is immediately renormalizable, set Vr = B r ~^. Otherwise let Vr = I^-^^fr-i} where \\ = \\(fr-i) is the height of jr-\\' LEMMA 7.8. -Let fr = ^r /. Let us consider the backward orbit (7.1) of an interval J and the corresponding orbit (7.2) of a point z. Then there exist e = e(pe) > 0 such that either one of the points z-s c-jumps at some good moment, or z_^n-i) ^ D(Vr).\n\nProof of Lemma 4.2. -If the former possibility of Lemma 7.8 occurs than Lemma 2.1 yields (7.3) (note that the assumptions of Lemma 2.1 are satisfied due to Theorem 3.4). In the latter possibility happens then dist(^_i),J_(^_i)) ----rj--------< C(pe) \\ J -{n-l)\\ by essentially bounded geometry, and we are done again.\n\nThe lemma is proved. D"
