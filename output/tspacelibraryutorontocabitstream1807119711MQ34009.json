Eighteenand Twentv-four-Months (current studv) of Age Walking ski11 versus waiking experience as a predictor of barrier crossing in toddlers.\n\nThe first year of an infant's life represents a period of ciramatic change in which a number of important milestones are reached. Of particular importance to the developing child during t h time is the acquisition of independent locomotion. With the onset of mobility, a new level of autonomy is achieved by the infant. The most inmediate effect of this gain is a change in the nature of subsequent interactions between the child and hisher environment, with selfdirected locomotion assumed to be critical for the proper organization of the infant's cognitive, perceptuai and social systems (Berienthal & Campos, 1990).\n\nThe process of learning to crawl and walk is an incredible accomplishrnent, and it is not a feat easily achieved by the infant (Ado [ph, Eppler & Gibson, 1993a). The acquisition of motor skill depends upon the maturation and development of both skeletal and neuromuscular systems (Thelen, Skala & Scon Kelso, 1987), with the increasing refinement and integration of these systems leading to greater proficiency in walking. By the age of six years, a child's walking pattern is fairly well established (PufaIl & Dunbar, 1992). The ability to wdk successfully through the world is not the result of motor development alone, however; perceptual sensitivity to the surrounding world is also a key element (E.J. Gibson, 1988;E.J. Gibson & Schmuckler, 1989;Schmuckler, 1993Schmuckler, , 1996)). According to E. J. Gibson (1 988), perception guides a child's actions, and action, in turn, participates in perception. Thus, we can consider the perceptual and motor systems as being interdependent (E. S. Gibson, 1988;Schmuckler, 1993). This functional relation between perceptual and motor systems is central to the concept of affordances (E.J. Gibson, 1982, 1988; J.J. Gibson, 1979; Adolph, Eppler, & E.J. Gibson,   1993b). An fiordance can be thought of as the link between perception and action (E. J. Gibson, 1982, l988), in which the performance of any given action is based on a \"fit'\" between the physical capabilities of the actor and the constraints imposed by the environment (J.J. Gibson, 1979). Over the course of evolution, animais have adapted as a species to exploit a specific niche or environment (Adolph et al., 1993b). Consequently, the nature of the actorenvironment fit varies; what may be of use for one animal may not be for another.\n\nThus, successful action within the world necessitates at least two components. First, an actor m u t accurately perceive the afTordances of the environment; misperception, or missing the afFordances altogether, will result in non-adaptive actions. Second, the actor m u t urilize the information provided appropriately (Adolph et ai., 1993b); a failure to do so may have serious consequences for the individual. For example, misjudgrnents in the actor-environment fit are believed to be a contributing factor to an individual's level of accident proneness (Plumert, 1995).\n\nTa complicate matten, the relation between the actor and the environment is not static.\n\nRather, changes in the ski11 level or physical characteristics of the actor can bring about related changes in the actor-environment fit. During infancy, the ability to accurately perceive an affordance relies on children's ability to accommodate these changes and update their system.\n\nAs development progresses, new abilities arise bringing about new affordances (Adolph et al., 1993 b).\n\nInfancy, therefore, provides a unique opportunity for studying the development of affordances involved in locomotion and independent mobility (see Adolph et al., 1993b).\n\nStudies within this area have looked at infants' ability to discriminate the affordances of surfaces (Gibson, Riccio, Schmuckler, Stofiegen, Rosenberg, t Taormina, 1987;Lockrnan, 1984;Palmer, 1984;Schmuckler, 1996), walk up and d o m slopes (Adolph, 1995; Adolph et al.,   1993% 1993b), step over and under barrien (Heinrichs, 1994; H e i ~c h s , Richardson & Pick, 1993;Schmuckler, 1996), climb stairs (Ulnch, Thelen & Niles, 1990), as well as their ability to detour arouad objects and through apertures (Lochan, 1984; Palmer, 1989;Schmuckler, 1993; Schmuckler & Gibson, 1989).\n\nThe most common approach taken in studyng the development of afTordances has been to compare the abilities of infants to those of addts. investigation of the fiordances for locomotion in addts (e.g. Heinrichs, 1994;Heinrichs et al.. 1993;Konczak, Meeuwsen & Cress, 1992;Warren, 1984) has reveded three main findings. First, successful performance of basic locomotor actions, such as climbing stairs or moving through doorways, seem most strongly related or \"scaled\" to an actor's body size, and not to any absolute measure. Accordingly, researchee have said that action in the world is 'bbody-scaIed\" (Heinrichs, 1994;Schmuckler, 1996;Warren, 1984). For example, the maximum height for which an actor can efficiently climb stairs is best expressed as a ratio of the stair height to the individual's leg length (Warren, 1984). By presenting information in the form of body-scaled measurernents, performance cornparisons across individuais are possible ( H e i ~c h s , 1994). Second, percepîual judgments of capabilities are categorical; once a critical point has been reached, we change our judgrnent from \"able\" to \"unable\" (Heinrichs, 1994;Warren, 1984). And third, perceptual judgrnents are related to actual action capabilities. In generd, adults are usually quite accurate in judging whether they are capable of performing a given action (Plurnert, 1995). For example, Warren ( 1984) found that body size was related to a subject's view of a staircase as 'climbable' versus 'unclimbable'\n\nwith the riser height defining this point of transition a constant proportion of the subject's leg length. Confidence ratings of climbability also matched these categorical j udgments. Similady, et al. (1993) found that the critical transition points between \"stepping over & walking under a barrier\" and for \"crawling & walking under a barrier7' could be expressed as a constant function of leg length.\n\nin addition to anthropomorphic variables, scaling of action may also be detexmined by other factors, such as proficiency or ski11 measures, as well as basic kinematic factors (Scbmuckler, 1996). Unfortunately, the majority of research within the area of work on investigating action in the world has primarily looked at basic actions (e.g., climbing stairs, simng in chairs) for which most adults show little variation in proficiency. In an attempt to increase the variability of parameters such as ski11 or proficiency, Konczak et al. ( 1992) compared the stair-climbing abilities of young and old aduits. These researchers found that action capabilities were detemined by multiple biomechanical constraints, some anthropomorphic and others kinematic. Ln particdar, measures of leg strength and flexibility provided a better fit for the abilities of older adults, with almost two thirds of this age group (relative to younger subjects) showing a perfect match between action capabilities and perceptual judgments. Experience with reduced physicd abilities may have increased the older adults' awareness of the biomechanical constraints on their actions, resulting in kinematic variables taking on a greater role. A similar situation may be true for young children who are just learning to master a new motor ability.\n\nResearch investigating the critical boundaries of motor actions in children has produced varied results concerning the scaling of action to anthropomorphic, ski11 and kinematic variables.\n\nSome work has found that such transition points are related to anthropornorphic measures. For example, Heinric hs' ( 1 994) investigated aduits' and five-year-old children' s ability in crossing barries of varying height. Of interest were the heights at which a change in movernent was required for successful crossing; two such transition points were identified. The first transition involved a switch fiom stepping over the barrier to moving under it, and the seconci, involved a switch from bending under the barrier to moving under it with support. Both transition points were found to be a constant function of the subject's Ieg length. Likewise, Pufall and Dunbar (1992) looked at 6-,8-and 10-yemld children's perceptions of afTordances for stepping onto and over objects and found that by age six, children's percephial judgments of their action capabilities were also related to leg length.\n\nIn contrasr, anthropomorphic measurements have been of little use as predictors for the action capabilities of very young children; rather, locomotor experience and skill appear to better predict the abilities of toddlers (Adolph, 1995;Schmuckler, 1996;ülrich et al., 1990). For example, Ulrich et al. ( 1990) looked at the role of muscular strength, leg length and postural constraints of 8-to 15-month-old inf'ts in determining the heights that afford stairclimbing.\n\nM i had the choice of climbing one of three available staircases, differing in riser height. interestingly, differences in stair climbability were related to locomotor capabilities (waiking and stair climbing experience) and not to variations in body build. These researchers also looked at the abilities of 20-month-old infants. In keeping with the younger group, body size was not a good predictor of the infants' choices. Moreover, their choices were not determined by differences in walking or stair-climbing experience either. It may be that once a certain level of skill is achieved, the nser heights chosen in this experiment no longer represented a constraint, or more accurately, varying degrees of dificulty.\n\nSchmuckler ( 1996) investigated the action capabilities of 1and 2-year-old toddlers for crossing barriers vaxying in height as well as spatial extent and transparency. The rneasures of interest were the rates of successes, failures and refusais for each age group at each of a number of predetermined heights. Walking experience, height and weight, along with various indices of body proportion were assessed. The study found that increases in barrier heights systematically varied responses dong a continuum moving fiom successful crossing to failed attempts and finally to complete refiisals to attempt crossing. A more surprising result, though, was the fact bat walking experience, and not body sue, was the best predictor of infants' actions.\n\nUnfortunately, this study did not attempt to disentangle the relative roles of walking experience and walking skill; such a distinction has been suggested as critical by others (Adolph, 1995).\n\nFrom the reported studies, it would appear that the action choices of toddlers are detemined by different variables than those of a mature individual, and specificaily, appear to be related to locomotor experience. It may be that body-scaie measurements are only useful as predicton once a mature level of ski11 has been reached (Heinrichs, 1994;Schmuckler, 1996). A number of conceptual limitations must be considered when walking experience is used as an explanatory variable, however. First, waiking experience is ofien measured through retrospective parental reports, making it difficult to reliably index (Waik, 1966, cited in Heinrichs, 1994). Second and more importantly, walking experience is often confused with walking skill. Although expenence and ski11 are positively correlated in the early days of waiking (Bd & Brenière, 1992), they nonetheless represent two distinct concepts.\n\nWalking experience refen to the number of days between the omet of walking and the test session (Adolph, 1995) and thus reflects opportunities for leaming about the environment (Schmuckler, 1996); it is not at al1 clear, however, what activities contribute to or make up such \" o p p o ~t i e s \" . The question of whether walking expenence is a measure of practice with or exposure to the surfaces under investigation is difficult to answer (Adolph, 1995). For instance, previous experience with stairs or climbing gyms may change the nature of new encounters with barriers. A p s t history involving a serious accident has also been suggested as a possible mediator of children's perceptual judgments of their abilities (Adolph, 1995;Plumert, 1995).\n\nAlthough researchen try to match experience levels by holding age corntant, this procedure does not guarantee equivalence in actual experience.\n\nWalking skill, on the other hand, is determined by the interplay of a number of contributing kinematic variables, includùig flexibility, strength and balance, and interlimb coordination (Heinrichs, 1994;Schmuckler, 1996). Differences in walkïng ski11 between children may reflect differences arnong these kinematic variables. For instance, regardless of experience, some children are better walkers fiom the moment they take their first steps. Other children may show vast improvernents over short periods of time during which others may shiggle (Adolph, 1995). Thus, when investigating differences in the action capabilities of children, it is important to use measures that take these concepts into account and reflect the tnie developmental differences among the sarnple.\n\nOnly two studies to date have specifically addressed the conceptual difference between walking ski11 and walking experience in young children (Adoiph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1993a). Adolph et al. ( 1993a) looked at 8.5-and 14month-old toddlers' perceptual judpents as to whether a hiIl was safe for climbing up and down, examining the relative contributions of walking experience, walking ski11 and body proportions to these judgments. Four predetermined slopes were presented in both ascending and descending order for counterbalanced groups. For the ascending slopes, walking shll was the better predictor for the abilities of the 14-month-old toddlers. For the descending slopes, none of the variables investigated were useful as predictors.\n\nUnlike the ascending slopes, however, only two of the four descending slopes presented were perceived as walkable by the children. Alternative methods (e.g., sliding) of descent were used for the two slopes perceived as un-walkable. Because of the greatly reduced data set for the descending slopes, the researchers argue that their finding is exploratory at best. Neither crawling experience nor ski11 were usefui as predictors for the behavior of the younger group.\n\nIn a follow-up study, Adolph (1995) used a psychophysical staircasing procedure to specifically determine the walkmg boundaries of 14-monthsld toddlers. Using this procedure, toddlers were presented w i t h increasingly steep slopes until an angle was reached where they either failed or refused to walk up it. The process was then repeated in reverse, with the angle of the dope becoming less steep, until the toddlers could once again successfully walk down the slope (Adolph, 1995). Walking boundaries were defined as the steepest dope that children could, on average, successfully walk up while failing to walk up the next steepest increment (see Adolph, 1995 for details). One advantage of the psychophysical sîaircasing procedure is that researchers c m more closely approximate children's true abilities (Adolph, 1995). Using this procedure, Adolph ( 1995) found walking ski11 to be the best predictor overdl for both ascent and descent boundaries.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of walking experience and walking ski11 in determinhg the action choices of 18-and 24-month-old toddlen in crossing barrien of varying heights. Such an investigation was of interest for a number of reasons. First, as previously mentioned, few researchers have looked at these two concepts separately in their investigations of the af5ordances of locomoting children (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1993a);\n\nwdking skill, rather than walking experience, appears to be a more powemil predictor of the action capabilities of young children. Second, although walking patterns are still not mature, toddlers in this age range may show more variability in kinematic and anthropomorphic variables, as well as greater walking skill than the younger ages previously investigated. For example, Schmuckler (1996) found that 18-and 24-month-old toddlers were more accurate in their perceptual judgments of impassable buriers than 12-month-old toddlers. This finding suggests a developmental trend with the accuracy of ou. perceptual judgments improving with age. A similar trend has also been found for measures of walking ski11with improvements in walking ski11 positively correlated with days of waiking experience (Adolph, Vereij ken, Byrne & IIustre, 1996).\n\nMoreover, studies of b d e r crossing create an ideal situation for investigating percephial-motor behavior and its impact on the perception of fiordances. Both physical and percephial collstraints detemine an individual's ability to successfully cross a barrier. In choosing the best course of action, an actor must be able to accurately perceive the height and width of the barrier and take into account hidher physicai capabilities and limitations in executing the movements needed to cross (Schmuckler, 1996).\n\nAlthough the act of crossing a barrier can be accomplished in more than one way (see H e i ~c h s , 1994), the pnmary interest in this study includes the movement patterns involved in stepping over a barrier. For very low barrien, successfully stepping over simply entails taking a higher step than normal. For somewhat higher barriers, the actor must approach the barrier and plant one foot close to it, lift the other leg over and plant it on the other side. The actor mut then shift his weight to the other side of the barrier in order to bring the lagging leg across.\n\nCrossing barriers of even greater heights presents M e r difficulties, with strength, flexibility and balance playing a more significant role. For example, depending on the height of the barrier, it rnay be necessary for the actor to balance on her toes, and/or on the bal1 of her foot, in order to achieve the height needed to cross.\n\nBased on this description of the movement patterns involved in barrier crossing, as well as previous research, there are a number of variables that are of interest in exarnining the abilities of toddlers in stepping over barriers. Such rneasures include walking skill, walking experience, and various indices of body proportion. Previous investigations of walking ski11 in toddlers have used a global measure in which measures of stride length, step length, step width, foot rotation and dynamic base are derived fiom the inked footprint sequences of each chiId7s\n\nwalking pattern and compared to the mature pattern of adults (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1993a;Adolph et al., 1996;Boenig, 1977). The more closely a child's walking pattern resembles that of a mature adult, the more skilled he/she is at walking. in general, improvements in walking skill are associated with longer steps, longer smdes and smailer step IO widths when walking. Smdl foot rotations, indicating a straight path of progression when walking, are also associated with greater walking ski11 (Adolph, 1995; Adolph et al., 1996). In her work on affordances in locomotion, Adolph (1995) found this global measure of walking ski11 to be a powemil and usefid tool for predicting the walking boundaries of toddlen for going up and down slopes. Finally, a general questionnaire will attempt to assess previous experience with barriers and related surfaces.\n\nThirty-two toddlen participated in this study. 16 toddlers each at 18 months (7 boys and 9 girls) and 24 months ( 1 1 boys and 5 girls) of age. The mean age of each group was 18.0months and 24.8-months respectively. An additional 24 children ( 1 7 18-monthi>lds and 7 24month-olds) participated in the study but were not included in the data analysis. Of these children, they either ran on both walking triais (12)-refused to walk ( 1 ), did not reach their crossing limit as a consequence of refbsing to cross the barrier, kicking the barrier or becoming too upset to parîicipate (1 0) or, were too overexcited to participate ( 1 ). Al1 infants were recruited from the Scarborough, Ontario, community and received a toy and certificate for their participation.\n\nThe barrier created for Schmuckler (1996) was used in this study. The barrier consisted of two grey, hollow vertical poles, each supported by a steel base. Each of the poles had notches cut into them in 1 inch increments from top to bottom. A grey, plastic dowel, approximately 1.4 m long and 2 cm thick, stretched horizontally between these two poles, supported by the notches.\n\nThe notches allowed the horizontal dowel to be positioned from O inches off the ground up to 18 inches high.\n\nTesting took place in a long hailway with separate areas designated for two of the measures: walking ski11 and barrïer crossing. A video camera resting on a tripod at one end of the hallway recorded the experimental session. Al1 trials for both measures began at the experimenter's end of the hallway; consequently, the children's movements were al1 filmed fiom behind Each test session began with the assessment of walking skill followed by the assessment of barrier crossing abilities.\n\nIn the area of the hallway designated for the assessment of walking skill, the floor was lined w i t h a 6m long stnp of papa and a chair was placed at the beginning of the paper. Lines demarcating the starting line (i.e., the beginning of the papa) and the finishing Iine were drawn at either end of the paper (i. e., the end of the paper). The parent of the child was instmcted to stand at the finishing line and the child was placed at the starting line. Once the two experimenters had positioned themselves on either side of the length of the paper, the child was encouraged to walk along the paper to the waiting parent. For each test session, several practice trials took place to ensure that children would walk along the length of the paper and would not stray from the paper during the process. If a chi Id ran on the paper, the task was modeled by either the parent or the experimenter in order to demonstrate that walking was the desired behavior.\n\nFollowing the practice trials, the child was seated in the chair in order for the inkpads to be placed on hifier feet For ease of application, the inkpads were placed on pieces of cardboard that could easily be taped to the bottoms of a child's shoes; the bottom edge of each card was always placed such that it was in line with the edge of the child's heel. Each inkpad card consisted of a stnp of cardboard, rneasuring 10.2 x 3.8 cm, and two pieces of moleskin, one piece cut into the shape of a triangle (2.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) and one, cut into the shape of a square (2.5 x 2.5 cm). The moleskin was placed on the card such that the tip of the triangle touched the top edge of the card and the bottom edge of the square touched the bottom edge of the c d Liquid ink was applied to the moleskin imrnediately pnor to the car& king placed on the child's shoes. Once the inkpad cards were in place, the child was taken out of the chair, positioned at the starting line and again encouraged to walk towards hrs parent. At the end of the test trial, the parent picked up the child and the experimenters removed the inkpad cards. The trial was repeated with a fiesh strip of papa if the child happened to run dong the paper, stop halfway or tum around during the test trial.\n\nOnce walking ski11 had been assesseci, both parent and child moved to the second area of the hallway for the barrier crossing component of the study. The barrier was set up such that it was in line with a recessed d o o m y in the hallway. To protect a toddler fiom falls, gymnastic mats lined the floor. Again, two experimenten were responsible for running the experirnent.\n\nPositioned at opposite ends of the hallway, the first experimenter and one of the child's parents were responsible for encouraging the child to approach and cross the bamer. The second experimenter, positioned in the recessed doorway and hidden from view, was responsible for adjusting the barrier's height.\n\nPnor to testing, both parent and child had a chance to settle in and play with a pile of toys at the parent's end of the walkway in order to become accustomed to the new setup. Following this, the child was brought to the experimenter's end of the walkway. Once the barrier had been adjusted to the appropriate height, the child was encouraged to walk towards the barrier and to cross it in order to get a toy from the parent to bring back to the experimenter. Receiving a toy at the end of each trial is in contrast to the Schrnuckler (1996) study in which children carried toys to their parents. One concem with Schmuckler's (1996) methodology is that a child's balance may have been affected by not having her han& fiee when crossing the bmier; moreover, children in the study often took as many or even more toys then they couid easily handle.\n\nFor each triai, parents could provide verbal encouragement to their child but were discouraged from both physically helping their child and from simng too close to the barrier such that the child did not need to cross the barrier in order to get a toy. Because of the age of these participants and the possibility that they could trip and fa11 if they were unaware of the barrier's presence, the necessary movement needed to cross the barrier was modeled during the first few triais of the test session. Following the completion of a trial, the barrier was removed by the second experimenter and the child was induced back to the starting point. The second expenmenter then replaced the barrier, adjusted its height accordingly, and the process was repeated.\n\nAt the end of the session, a number of physical rneasures were taken to assess the child's body size. These rneasures included the child7s standing and sitting height, body weight, as well as waist, hip and shoulder width. Parents were also asked various questions related to their child's walking experience. The entire session lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes.\n\nA modified psychophysical staircase procedure was used to determine the barrier crossing thresholds of the toddlers. With this procedure, subjects are presented with stimuli in increasing increments until a change in behavior or response occurs. The process is then repeated in reverse, with the stimuli presented in decreasing order until a change in responding again occurs. This pattern of altemating between increasing and decreasing increments is continued with each change in response until a predetermined cntenon has been met; at which point, a measure of threshold is taken (Adolph, 1995;Schrnuckler, 1996).\n\nAdapting this procedure to barrier crossing, infants were initially presented with a iow bamer height (three inches). Their crossing behavior was coded as a success (e-g., able to step over), a failure (e-g., falls down when crossing) or a refusai (e-g., no attempt was made). Special notations were used if the child attempted to crawl over the barrier or if the child held on to the side of the barrier while crossing; the success or failure of these attempts were also recorded. If a child was able to successfully cross a specific barrier height twice in a row, the height was increased by two inches. increases in height continued until a failure or refusal to cross occurred Following this change in behavior, the barrier height was decreased by one inch. If the child was still unabie to cross, the banier height was dropped again by one inch. Increases in barrier height once again occurred if the infant could successfully cross the barriet two times in a row; subsequent wuccessfid crosses caused a decrease. B M e r heights that a child failed to cross on two trials while still able to cross the next lowest height were coded on-line as a crossing threshold.\n\nTo avoid mistration at repeated failures, trials at a very low height were interspersed throughout the experiment (Schrnuckler, 1996). Trials at a very low height were also used to break up a pattern of supported crossing (i.e., successfully stepping over the barrier while holding on to the side). The nurnber of trials completed by a child was variable and depended to a great deal on how quickly the child walked back and forth during the test session; al1 children, however, completed a minimum of 17 triais for inclusion in the study.\n\nMeasures of body weight, standing and sitting height, and shouider, waist, and hip widths were taken for each child A standard bathroom scale with a digital readout was used to measure the child's weight. A measuring tape placed on a wall allowed for recordings of height to be easily made when a child was standing with her back against the wall and when she was seated on the floor in the same manner. Width measurements were obtained by wrapping a measuring tape amund the child's shoulder bones, the area around her navel and, the area above her pelvic bone, for shoulder, waist and hip measures, respectively.\n\nFrom these measures, a number of additional measures could be denved, inciuding leg length (sitting heightstanding height), the Ponderal Index (weight/(standing heightP x 100) and a ratio of shoulder widWwaist width. In chikiren, small values of the Ponderal Index and the shoulder-to-waist ratio are associated with more mature body proportions (Adolph, 1995).\n\nWalking skill was assessed using information denved from the inked footprint sequences of each toddler's walking pattern (Adolph, 1995;Boenig, 1977). A transparent grid (0.25 cm) was w d to obtain XY coordinates for the middle portion of each child's walking pattern, where it is believed that children hit their stride (Breniere, Bril & Fontaine, 1989). For each footprint, XY coordinates of the tip of the toe pnnt and the midpoint of the heel pnnt were obtained. For each child, a minimum of three footprints per foot were coded.\n\nA specially designed cornputer program was w d to derive the relevant measures of interest from the XY coordinates of the footprint sequences; these measures included stride and step Iength, step width, foot rotation, and dynamic base. Stride length is defined as the distance between the heel prints of the sarne foot Step Iength is the distance between the heel strike of one foot and the heel strike of the other foot.\n\nStep width is a measure of the lateral distance between the heel strike of one foot and the heel strike of the other foot. The angle of a child's toe print relative to their heel pnnt is given by the measure of foot rotation (Le., toe-in or toeout); children who are more skilled at walking point their feet straight ahead (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1996). And finally, dyoarnic base is a measure of the \"angle between the stide of one foot and the step on the other foot\" (Adolph, 1995); this angle can be obtained fiom three More specifically, dynamic base reflects how well chiidren are able to control their path of progression; as walking skill improves, dynamic base approaches angles of 180 degrees. This relatively new measure of walking skill is designed to provide information about step length, step width and the relation between them (Adolph, 1995). Of the types of information provided by thrs global rneasure (Le., the footprint method) of walking skill, dynamic base was fond to be the greatest predictor of the children's walking boundaIies for both ascending and descending slopes in Adolph's (1995) study.\n\nParents were encouraged to consult their personal records pnor to their visit as they would be asked to provide information concerning the onset of crawling, independent standing, and upright locomotion for their child Upright locomotion was defined as the age at which children can stand on their own, without any help, and walk 10 steps across a room (Schmuckler, 1996). To obtain additional information about more individual experiences with walking, parents were asked about their child's experience with stain, gates, and playground equipment.\n\nParents were also asked whether their child had ever experienced a serious fa11 or whether he/she displayed any fear of heights.\n\nTo examine whether the walking ski11 measures obtained varied as a function of lefi versus nght foot within the two age groups, a series of preliminary two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted. Wallcing skill measures included stride length, step length, step width, foot rotation, dynamic base (3) and dynamic base (4). None of these measures produced a significant main effect for foot (right vs. left), or any interaction between foot and age (al1 es > 0.05); coosequently, al1 wdking skill measures were averaged across left and right feet The first prïmary series of analyses examined the anthropomorphic, walking ski11 and locomotor experience measures, as well as the subsequent crossing thresholds, as a function of age (1 8 vs. 24 months), using one-way ANOVAs. The next senes of analyses examined the relation between crossing thresholds and the variables of interest, body size, walking skill, age and locomotor expenence (normalization analyses). And finally, the correlations within and between crossing thresholds, body size variables, walking skill and locomotor experience were examined.\n\nAge DiEerences in terms of body size, children in the two age groups differed on a number of physical parameters. Significant differences between the ages were found for standing height [F ( 1 , 30) = p < .OOi) and hip width [F (1,30) = 5.38. MSE = 8.00, g < -051. Generally, the older children were taller and heavier than the younger children. Not al1 anthropomorphic measures vaned as a function of age, however. Specifically, there were no differences in measures of waist width [F ( 1,30) = 0.3 1, MSE = 0.501, shoulder width [F ( 1,30) = 3.79, MSE = 5.9 11, Ponderal Index (1,30) = 0.1 1, MSE = 0.001, or shoulder-to-waist ratio IF (1,30) = 1.27, MSE = 0.011 as a h c t i o n of age. Mean values for the 18and 24-month-old toddlers for al1 of these measures are given in Table 1.\n\nIn contrast to the body size measures, assessments of walking ski11 showed few differences as a hction of age. Ody marginally significant differences were found for stride length and step length, F (1,30) = 3.60, MSE = 147.86, p = .O68 and F (1,30) = 3.5 1, MSE = 33.15, =.071, respectively. A comparison of the mean values given in Table 1 for these measures of wallcing skill show that 24-month-old toddlea have slightly longer strides and steps as two children in the study were reported to never have crawled. Overall, and not surprisingly, older children were found to have had more locomotor experience than younger children.\n\nAgain, rnean values for the various experiential variables as a funchon of age are given in Table 1.\n\nSimilady, crossing thresholds were also found to Vary as a function of age [-( 1,30) = 36.15, MSE = 1 12.50, E c -001). Older children were successfully able to cross barrien much higher in height than younger children. The mean crossing threshold for the 24-month-old children was 9.3 1 in. (-= 1-78 in.) and 5.56 in. (SD = 1.75 in.) for the 18-month-old children.\n\nThe next step in the analysis involved exarnining the relation between crossing thresholds and the various body size, walking skill, and locomotor experience measures. To accomplish this goal, each child's crossing threshold was divided by each of the various measures; the resulting normalized crossing thresholds were then compared as a function of age in a senes of one-way ANOVAs. This procedure, developed by Schrnuckler (1 9%), was adapted from Warren (1984), who found that differences in the maximum height of perceived stair climbability between short and tall participants were eliminated once these judgments were divided by the participants' leg length. In the current conte* factors that are most strongly related to crossing thresholds will eliminate differences in threshold values, both within an age group as well as between age groups. in contrast, variables that are less strongly related to crossing thresholds, although reducing ciifferences within and between age groups, will not eliminate these differences (Schuckler, 1996).\n\nTable 2 presents the results of the I -way ANOVAs, with the factor of age ( 18 vs. 24 months), on the normalized crossing thresholds. Replicating Schmuckler (1 996)-none of the body size variables removed the differences in crossing thresholds as a function of age.\n\nInterestingly, and in contrast to Adolph's (1995;Adolph et al., 1993a) findings, measures of wallung ski11 were similarly ineffective in removing threshold differences across the ages.\n\nAlternatively, and again replicating Schmuckler (1996), al1 of the experiential variables successfdly eliminated the threshold differences as a function of age.\n\nAn alternative way of M e r examining the relation between crossing thresholds and the various body size, ski11 and experiential variables involves calculating the correlation between these variables, both across and within each age group; these correlation coefficients are presented in Table 3. For the analyses combining the two age groups, it is worth noting that the largest correlations were found between crossing thresholds and the three types of Iocomotor experience; this finding is also in keeping with the earlier findings obtained From the normalized data. Alço of interest are the large correlations between crossing thresholds and standing height and between, crossing thresholds and leg length for the combined age groups.\n\nLooking at the individual age groups, a significant correlation between crossing thresholds and leg length was also found for the 24-monthslds. This finding, in conjunction with the correlation for the combined age group, suggests that the physical parameter of leg length is influencing crossing thresholds. A significant negative correlation was also evident between the angle of the foot rotations of 24month-old children and their crossing thresholds.\n\nSmailer foot rotations were associated with higher crossing thresholds; they are also associated with greater walking skill (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1996).\n\nThe intercorrelations among the walking ski11 variables assessed also show strong correlations; these values are presented in Table 4. Not surprisingly, stride Iength and step length, were alrnost perfectly correlated w i t h another. Large correlations were also found between measures of dynamic base and stride length, step length, and step width. Again this is not surprising as the measure of dynamic base is designed to reflect the relation between these three variables. Similar patterns are seen in the correlations among the walkmg skill variables for the individual age groups. Unexpectedly, step width was only weakly correlated with stride and step length for the combined age group; moreover, a significant positive correlation was found for the 24-month-old toddlers. This is in contnist to previous findings on changes in walking skill, where step widths have been found to decrease as stride and step length increase (Adolph, 1995); with a larger sample size, however, the pattern seen here may change.\n\nLooking at the correlation between measures of walking ski11 and locomotor experience for the combined ages, stride and step length were positively correlated with length of crawling and walking experience. Thus, longer steps and strides were seen in children with greater arnounts of crawling and walking experience. Adolph et al. (1996) also found a large correlation between days of walking experience and measures of waUcing skill. Standing experience, however, was only weakly correlated with step and stride length. No significant correlations were found between the measures of step width, foot rotation, dynamic base (3) and dynamic base (4) and, locomotor experience for the combined ages. For the individual age groups, dynamic base (4) was significantly correlated with standing experience for the 24-month-old children. However, no other significant correlations between the measures of walking skill and locomotor experience were found for the individuai age groups. Al1 of these correlation coefficients are presented in Table 5.\n\nTo summarize the main findings of this expenment, a nurnber of parameters were exarnined, including measures of walking skill, body size, and locomotor experience, as well as the barrier crossing abilities for a group of 18and 24-month-old toddlers. Walking skill was assessed using the footprint method of gait analysis; few significant ciifferences however were found between the two ages. On al1 other measures though, 24-month-old children were found to ciiffer in several ways fiom 18-month-old children. In addition to being larger and heavier, the older children also had more crawling, standing and walking experience than did the younger children. The older group of toddlers were also able to cross barrien rnuch higher in height than the younger group of toddlers. Of the variables investigated (body size, walking skill and locomotor experience) as possible predictors of children's barrier crossing abilities, walking experience was found to be the best predictor of crossing thresholds for 18and 24-rnonth-old children.\n\nAlthough previous work, addressing the conceptual di fference between wal king ski Il and walking experience, found waiking skill to be a stronger predictor of children's abilities to wdk up and d o m slopes than waiking experience (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et ai., 1993a), the findings of the current study paint a somewhat different picture. Rather the action capabilities of 18-and 24-month-old toddlers for crossing a barrier varying in height were strongly predicted by the length of time a child had been independently mobile. This finding is consistent with previous work by Schrnuckler ( 1996) in which barrier crossing thresholds were most strongly related to the amount of walking experience a child had had-There are severai possible explanations for the apparent dichotomy in findings seen here with respect to the roles of walking experience and walking skill in predicting the abilities of newly locomoting children. First of dl, the actions involved in walking up and d o m slopes are dramatically different from those required to cross over a barrier. The key actions involved in banier crossing depend to a certain degree on the height of the banier. As previously discussed (see Heinrichs, 19941, stepping over very low barriers simply involves taking a slightly higher step than when normally walking. High barriers, on the other hand, involve an interplay of balance, strength and flexibility and a more complicated series of movements (e.g., balancing on one foot, swinging a leg across the barrier). As the height of the bamer continues to increase, so too, does the level of dificulty involved; eventually, a height will be reached where it is no longer physically possible for an individual to step over the banier. Thus, the act of successfully crossing over a barrier depends to a large degree on the actor recognizing the correct pattern of actions needed to cross.\n\nIn contrast, successfully walking up and down slopes involves repeating a similar set of actions over and over. Although the basic leg actions are the wune as those used to walk across a flat surface, the direction and angle of the slope can put different physical demands on these farniliar actions. For instance, when walking up a slope, the actor leans forward, an action that aids in his acceleration up the slope; however, when walking down a slope, the actor must lean backwards to avoid increasing his fonvard momentum and toppling fonvards (Adoiph et al., 1993a).\n\nGiven these different demands, the walking skill assessrnent used (Adolph, 1995; Adolph   et al., 1996; Boenig, 1977), although thought of as a global mesure of walking skill, is more closely attuned to the motor demands of walking up and down slopes than to the motor demands of barrier crossing. For exarnple, walking on flat ground does not require the actor to balance on one foot while swinging a leg across an obstacle. Thus, although, intended as a general measure of skill, the footprint method of gait analysis rnay in fact be much more specific to particular locomotor activities. Adolph's ( 1995) owvn findings wodd seem to support this very idea.\n\nAlthough Adolph ( 1 995) found dynamic base to be the best predictor of the abilities of 1 4month-old toddlen to walk up and down slopes, the strength of this relation was affected by the direction of the slope. Larger correlations were found between measures of dynamic base and walking boundaries for ascending than for descending slopes.\n\nWalking up and d o m slopes also differ in terms of the physical demands and the level of control required to maneuver oneself. Whereas walking up a slope may be more physically tiring, it requires less physical control than walking down a slope; one consequence of this ciifference is that there is less danger of senously hurting oneself when going up a slope than when going d o m a slope (Adolph, 1995). With respect to the amount of control required, walking on flat ground would be sirnilar to walking up a slope, in that it too, would require lower levels of physical control than walking d o m a slope. It may be that as the arnount of control required in a physical task increases (thereby moving M e r away from the levels required for walking on flat ground), this global measure of walking ski11 is no longer of use. The pattern of correlations found by Adolph (1995) would certainly seem to support the hypothesis that the strength of the relation between this global measure of walking skill and the physical task being predicted is dependent on how sirnilar the two are in makeup.\n\nAlso consistent with this suggestion are the findings of B d and Brenière ( 1992) from a two-year study in which a number of gait panuneters were assessed in a group of children following their first steps. According to these researchers, the development of walking in young children occurs in two phases. The first phase, lasting between 3 to 6 months after the onset of walking, is a learning period in which a child leams to integrate the necessary physical components needed to initiate her first steps (Brenière et al., 1989). During this time period, ciramatic visible changes in a child's gait occur. The second phase is a period in which a child's abilities become more finely tuned; it is characterized by a stabilizing of the gait parameten and takes place during the 18 months following the end of the first phase ( B d & Brenière, 1992).\n\nUnfominately, the researchers only observed children for a penod of two years following the onset of wallung (i-e., until roughly their third birthday). As it has been suggested that children do not have mature pattern of walking until they are around six years of age (Pufidl & Dunbar, 1992), it is conceivable that the length of ths second phase is much longer than originally suggested. Aiternatively, the development of walking may be more complicated than a two phase process.\n\nBril and Breniere ( 1992) M e r suggest that during the first developmental phase of walking, a child's prirnary goal is twofold: not only must the child l e m how to maintain sufficient postural control to remain upright but he must also do so while attempting to propel his body forward. Until a child has adequately mastered this process, upright locomotion is limited Thus, the process of maintaining postural control while walking is a complicated one that c m only be successfully achieved through the integration of a nurnber of interdependent elements. One consequence of the complexity of üus process is that the abilities of a child displayed during this first phase are very sensitive to extemal influences. As a result, situations that are posturally demanding for a child may lead to a visible regression in the child's ability to maintain her balance. Manipulations, then, that stress the child's postural control system can be seen to either reject or support predictions of a causal relation between characteristics of gait displayed early on and balance control (Bd& Brenière, 1992).\n\nThis hypothesis may in fact be a key factor in the task related pattern of findings seen here. Following the ideas put forth by Bnl & Breniere (1992), the act of crossing a barrier would easily qualifi as a very pomirally demanding task, particularly in the case of a very young child Thus, measures of a child's walking ski11 on flat ground (a task that is presumably less posturally demanding than barrier crossing and consequenîly, would not disturb postural control to the same degree) may not be sîrongly related to crossing thresholds.\n\nPerhaps then what is needed is a different measure of skill; one that more accurately assesses the elements involved in crossing a barrier. For instance, although the footprint method of gait analysis provides a global measure of w a h g skill, this ability can dso be assessed through measures of various kinematic parameters, such as balance, flexibility and strength. A number of different tests cm be used to measure each of these parameters independently (see Heinrichs, 1994). One limitation of these tests however, is that Iittle information is available conceming how such variables change as a function of increasing age (and presumably) walking skill; the absence of such cornparison data rnay be due to the dificulty in testing these variables in young children. In spite of the lack of such information, an attempt was made to assess these three lunematic parameten in the two age groups of interest in the current study. Unfominately, these attempts had to be abandoned as the physical demands of the task were either too great, especially for the younger age group, or the children were simply too young to complete the task on demand putting into question the reliability of the measure obtained.\n\nAltematively, it may be that the importance of ski11 itself changes with age. For instance, it may be useful to think of skill in an ab-ct way. Early in life, ski11 rnay be of a global fom; over time, the basic elements making up this global form of skill become increasingly differentiated and refined Thus, it may be that once a basic (although not yet mature) level of skill has been achieveà, experiential factors take on a greater role in predicting a child's motor walking ski11 in predicting children's abilities in +og up and down dopes but, it will also help to chart the developmental changes involved in the scaling of the action capabilities of children in a variety of physical tasks. Moreover, it will provide information as to whether the physical demands of barrier crossing and those involved in walking on flat ground are similar enough to make direct comparisons.\n\nIn addition to examining the abilities of even younger age groups, attention also needs to be directed towards the abilities of older children. Previous work examining the scaling of action choices in barrier crossing has found crossing thresholds to be strongly related to leg length in children as young as five ( H e i ~c h s , 1994). The large correlation coefficient found between leg length and crossing thresholds for 24-month-old children in the current study, however, suggests that a scaling of action to a physical measure may be seen in children younger than 5 years of age. Future studies examining the abilities of children falling between 2 and 5 years of age will allow researchers to determine the age at which the scaling of a child's action capabilities switches fiom experiential factors to physical factors.\n\nIn spite of the differences found in action capabilities for crossing a barrier v-g in height, few differences were found in the measures of walking skill between the 18-and 24rnonth-old toddlers in this study. Overall, oniy slight differences in step length and smde length were found, with older children taking longer steps and strides than the younger children.\n\nAlthough greater differences were expected, this pattern is consistent with improvements in walking skill. Children who are more skilled at walking take both longer strides and steps, their feet are also more closely positioned to one another and point straight ahead when walking than children who are less skilled (Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1996).\n\nA cornpanson of the range of values for the skill measures assessed in the cment study with those obtained in Adolph's (1995) study does indicate a very large difference in w&ng within a leg) coordination, the researchen found that children achieved an adult-like relation between these two elements after three months of d n g . In Adolph's ( 1995) study, the mean length of walking experience for the children involved was approximately 2.5 months (M = 76.87 days); a period of tirne fdling short of Clark and Philip's (1993) three-month mark. In contrast, this three-month mark is clearly surpassed even by the youngest age group in the current study who had on average 6.64 months of walking experience. The lack of a difference in skill measures between children's feet in the current study M e r illustrates an increasingly synchronized, and thus, more consistent pattern of walking in children 18 months of age and older.\n\nThus, the results of the current study suggest that linle change in walking ski11 occun between the ages of 18 and 24 months; however, large changes indicative of improvements do seem to take place between the ages of 14 and 18 months (see Adolph, 1995;Adolph et al., 1996). These findings are consistent with the two-phase theory of walking development put forth by Bril and Brenière (1 992); one limitation to this theory however, is that little is known about changes in walking ski11 that may occur past this second phase. As a mature pattern of walking is not achieved until the age of six (Mal1 & Dunbar, 1992), there is a strong possibility that more than two phases are involved in this developmental process. More information is thus needed to detennine exactly how the gait parameters assessed by the footprint method change as a fwiction of age. Additionally, the limitations of this assessrnent technique as a predictor for different forms of visually-guided locomotion also needs to be addressed.\n\nNot only is future research critical for charting the developmental changes that occur in walking skill but much is also needed to determine the changes that take place in the scaling of action capabilities in young children. This study, in conjunction with the work of Adolph (1995), Schmuckler (1996) and Heinrichs (1994) suggests that the scaling of action in young children follows a specific developmental path. Early on, walking slcill appears to play an important role in predicting a child's physicd capabilities. Once a certain level of walking skill is achieved however, these skill factors are displaced in favor of locomotor experience as the strongest predictor of children's abilities. And finally, once a mature pattern of walking is achieved, a scaling of action to anthropomorphic factors, sirnilar to that found for adults, is seen.\n\nThus, children' s ability to successfully navigate themselves through the world depends to a large degree on their sensitivity to, and ability to adapt to the senes of changes occurring in the fit between themselves and their environment.\n\nMean Values and Standard Deviations for Measures of Bodv Size, Walkin~ Skill, Locomotor Exmxience. and Crossing Thresholds 18 Months 24 Months Variable Mean -SD Mean -SD Body Size Standing height (in.)
