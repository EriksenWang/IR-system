    "full_text": "Based on these initial testing results, subsequent testing and data analysis were conducted for accelerometer based and dual microphone based systems. Four data analysis methods have been used: (1) Averaging signals in the time domain, (2) FFT of time domain waveforms over a specified time, (3) Averaging frequency spectra, and (4) Statistical methods for time domain signals. Individual frequency spectra (from FFT) and the average of multiple frequency spectra have shown potential to distinguish between signals from faulty and healthy light assemblies. Statistical measures, such as, Arithmetic mean (µ) and Kurtosis (K) can also be used to differentiate healthy and faulty light assemblies. In general, this work has shown the good potential to develop methods for adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic systems that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure.

manufacturers are under extreme pressure to improve the quality of their parts, while at the same time reducing costs. To improve quality requires regular inspection and testing of parts. The inspection and testing of parts need to be done in a repeatable and standard way. The method currently used to detect failures in automotive light assemblies after vibration endurance testing involves manual inspection only after the test is completed.\n\nAn adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and fault diagnostic system that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure is desired.\n\nDecoma Autosystems, a division of Decoma, is a manufacturer of automotive headlights and tail-lights and is located at Belleville, Ontario. Decoma is a full service supplier of exterior appearance systems for all major automotive companies. The company designs and manufactures automotive exterior components and systems which include fascias (bumpers), front and rear end modules, plastic body panels, roof modules, exterior trim components and sealing for cars and light trucks (including sport utility vehicles and mini-vans). Decoma Autosystems, established in 1971, has three plants with a total of approximately 400 employees. It designs, manufactures and tests automotive headlight and taillight assemblies for different automotive manufacture including: GM, Ford, and Chrysler. Figure 1-1 shows a lamp assembly that is used in this project.\n\nAccording to the requirement of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), individual automotive manufacturers need to conduct specified testing at the factory to ensure quality before automotive lamp assemblies go to market. Generally, testing for mechanical breakage of assemblies, optical quality and climate effects are required. One of the quality control tests for automotive light assemblies is to subject them to a 24-hour vibration test on a shaker table, as defined by the SAE. To pass the test the sample assemblies must complete the test without any breakage.\n\nThe method of detecting failure that Decoma Autosystems currently uses involves the manual inspection of the light after the 24-hour test. The current testing method has a major flaw: when assemblies do break, it is not possible to know when the breakage occurred and what the initial failure was, since testing runs un-interrupted for 24 hours.\n\nIn recent years, the use of automated condition monitoring systems for the supervision of automotive plants has been more widely prevalent. This has occurred partially as a result of the extensive work aimed at producing systems which can identify a range of fault conditions and which may also be able to deliver scheduling information based upon limited automated diagnostic capabilities. Thus, Decoma Autosystems would like to have a monitoring system that would interrupt the shaker table operation at the first onset of a failure. The monitoring system is desired to be an adaptable, reliable, low-cost diagnostic system. Decoma Autosystems is particularly interested in the potential offered from accelerometer, microphone and acoustic emission (stress wave)\n\nsensor based techniques for breakage detection.\n\nThe objective of this research project is to investigate whether vibration, acoustic and/or stress wave monitoring techniques can be used to detect mechanical failures in automotive light assemblies as they undergo shaker table testing.\n\nTo develop a failure detection and diagnostic system for this specific use six criteria are used:\n\n(1) Meaningful data\n\nThe main objective of the system is to collect data in order to facilitate the detection of failures. Thus the amount of meaningful data that can be collected by the system will determine its ultimate success. The system should be able to detect most, if not all, possible failures during vibration testing. The optimal diagnostic system is required to perform these functions:\n\n(a) Detect the fault location in the light assembly.\n\n(b) Detect faults during the test and record the time at which they first were detected.\n\n(c) Avoid false alarms.\n\n(\n\nAny data collected must be stored for future analysis. That is, all of the collected data that represents faults should be able to be recorded.\n\n(\n\nSince many headlight arrangements will be used on the same shaker table, the diagnostic system must be adaptable to multiple arrangements. Some of these arrangements could include different orientations of headlights as well as multiple headlights being tested at once.\n\nAny system must operate inside the shaker table enclosure (or be connected to the outside by nothing more than a cable), and thus must meet its space requirements. Figure 1-2 shows the shaker table that is used by Decoma Autosystems. (5) Cost effective\n\nAlthough no definite budget was assigned, given the relative infrequency of failures encountered and the relative low cost of headlights/taillights, the system should be relatively cost effective.\n\nThe system should be used friendly, and simple to set up and operate.\n\nGenerally speaking, a real-time diagnostic system should consist of three main components: the front end, the intermediate section and the back end. The front end contains a transducer and pre-amplifier; the intermediate section consists of a signal conditioner and other support electronics, such as, a data acquisition system; and the back end is the software and analysis package.\n\nThe research project was divided into five parts: (1) Equipment selection, (2) Monitoring and diagnostic system setup, (3) Initial testing and data processing, (4) Subsequent testing and data analysis, (5) Result comparison for all the testing and data analysis, (6) Drawing conclusions and making useful recommendations for future work.\n\nThe thesis is organized as follows:\n\nChapter 1 introduces the background motivation and objectives of the project. Chapter 4 describes the entire data analysis method in time domain and frequency domain that is used in this project, and the LabVIEW data analysis program.\n\nIn Chapter 5, initial testing with multiple faults and data processing results are shown and discussed, and design recommendations are given based on the initial results.\n\nThen subsequent testing on light assemblies with single faults is conducted and different data analysis methods, such as, averaging in time domain and in frequency domain, statistical methods and results are discussed.\n\nIn Chapter 6, the conclusions of the project and recommendations for future work are given.\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review Product quality and process efficiency have been at the centre of attention for many industries for a long time. As a result, quality condition monitoring in real time is increasingly important since great financial savings are possible, especially in high volume manufacturing where defective parts lead to losses in production and necessitate time-consuming and expensive repair. In recent years, sensor and control technologies have become increasingly mature, allowing closed loop control of critical parameters and comprehensive failure parameter data collection and storage, all of which have improved process quality control.\n\nThe traditional failure detection strategies of run-to-failure are increasingly unacceptable to many process and manufacturing operations. Alternatively using Condition Monitoring (CM) systems with predictive capabilities to provide early detection of machinery problems, based on collection and analysis of machine data, is more desirable. A valid condition monitoring system is able to increase machine availability, performance and life span, and is able to reduce consequential damage, spare parts inventories, and breakdown maintenance. A detailed review of failure, condition monitoring and data analysis will be presented in the following subsections.\n\n[1]\n\nFailure is defined as \"The termination of the ability of an item to perform its required function.\" which has the following categories [2]:\n\n1) Catastrophic failures which result in an immediate inability of a system to achieve its function;\n\n2) Performance failures associated with a reduced performance of the equipment;\n\n3) When the operator deliberately takes the equipment out of service, even though it is producing, at that time, its specified output.\n\nThe terms \"failure\" or \"fault\" may be viewed from different angles according to the effect that the lack of performance has on the overall functional capability.\n\nEngineering failure can be classified into two distinct classes of failure:\n\n1) Intermittent failure: failures which result in a lack of some function of the component only for a very short period of time, the component reverting to its full operational standard immediately after failure;\n\n2) Permanent failure: failures that result in lack of some function that continues until some part of the component is replaced.\n\nThe technical investigation of failure has for long been regarded by the industry as an essential procedure from which information can be gained into causes of failure.\n\nThe following main principles of procedure for failure handling were proposed by Meyer\n\n[3]:\n\n1)\n\nThe sooner an investigation is started, the greater are the chances of determining the real cause or causes;\n\n2) Do not destroy evidence. Do not disturb or tidy up the scene of failure or accident, especially do not touch fracture or their immediate surroundings;\n\n3) Interfere with evidence only after through documentation (report, description, photographs). Ensure that dismantled parts can be identified individually, reassembled, and repositioned correctly relative to each other. Handle and pack pieces of evidence carefully so that they are not scratched, rubbed, indented, or deformed accidentally; 4) Do not concentrate on point of fracture to the exclusion of its surroundings and of environmental conditions. Approach the origin of failure gradually after drawing maximum information from surrounding evidence. The immediate origin and cause of local failure may have been only the trigger for a major failure determined by other causes. Coincidence of a chain of cause is more the rule than the exception;\n\nDo not guess or draw easy conclusions. Collect all the facts and then eliminate non-essentials. Rely on site photographs, notes and sketches rather than memory. A cause has been established not when it becomes obvious but only when all other possibilities have been eliminated.\n\nTry to obtain the true history from objective evidence and from interviews.\n\nDo not take any statements or opinions on trust, especially not your own.\n\nHuman perceptions, judgments, and decisions are all fallible and subject to subconscious prejudices.\n\nCondition monitoring is a process of monitoring a parameter of condition in machinery, such that a significant change is indicative of a developing failure. Then the parameter will be regularly monitored so that the change of the parameter can be observed. Once a change is detected a more detailed analysis of the measurements will be  In current industrial practice, quality is ensured in the product engineering cycle at two distinct stages. The earlier stage is to use Taguchi-type methods at the product design stage to ensure the quality of the product. The later stage is the use of Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods during inspection to check the quality of the manufactured part after the part is manufactured. Condition monitoring will introduce a third level of quality assurance, which can be implemented during machining. Leading to Market Need Quality Product In-process Quality Control Statistical Process Control (SPC) INSPECTION MACHINING Taguchi Methods The most rudimentary form of condition monitoring is visual inspection by experienced operators and maintainers. Failure modes such as cracking, leaking, corrosion, etc., can often be detected by visual inspection before failure is likely.\n\nSlight temperature variations across a surface can be discovered with visual inspection and nondestrauctive testing with thermography. Heat is indicative of failing components, especially degrading electrical contacts.\n\nUsing a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or other standard microscope to exam a carefully-taken sample of debris suspended in lubricating oil is able to reveal the elements contained, their proportions, size and morphology. This method is called Wear Debris Analysis (WDA). Using WDA, the site, the mechanical failure mechanism and the time to eventual failure may be determined. Spectrographic oil analysis tests the chemical composition of the oil and can be used to predict failure modes. For example, high silicon content may indicate contamination with sand, and high iron levels indicate wearing components. Individually, elements give fair indications, but when used together they can accurately determine failure modes. For internal combustion engines, the presence of iron/aluminium, and carbon would indicate worn piston rings.\n\nUltrasound can be used for high speed mechanical app.lications and for high pressure fluid situations. A high pitched 'buzzing sound' in bearings indicates flaws in the contact surfaces, and when partial blockages occur in high pressure fluids the orifice will generate a large amount of ultrasonic noise.\n\nPerformance analysis is where the physical efficiency, performance, or condition is found by comparing actual parameters against an ideal model. Deterioration is typically the cause of difference in the readings.\n\nThe most commonly used method for failure detection is called vibration analysis.\n\nMeasurements can be taken on machine bearing casings, or on some machines, with sensors that directly observe the rotating shafts. The level of vibration can be compared with historical baseline values, and in some cases with established standards, to assess the severity.\n\nVibration refers to mechanical oscillations about an euilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic, such as the motion of a pendulum, or random, such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road. Most of the time the vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound noise. So the studies of sound and vibration are related. Sound pressure waves are generated by vibrating structures (e.g. vocal cords), and sound pressure waves can generate vibration of stuctures (e.g. ear drum). Hence, anaysis the character of vibration is similar to the anaysis of acoustic noise and acoustic emission character at the same time.\n\nAny system which possesses the inherent properties of inertia and stiffness oscillates about its equilibrium position when perturbed by an outside force. Vibration usually arises when there is rubbling between two material surfaces or rolling contact.\n\nThe duration and the magnitude of the vibrations depend upon the degree of damping the materials possess and the phase relationships between the exciting force and the response of the system.Vibrations, once generated, are transmitted through the structure or medium to other components or sub-systems. Resonance occurs when the natural frequency of the system corresponds to the exciting frequency. By monitoring the vibration conditions of machines at critical positions in a methodical manner, and by analysing the vibration signals in an intelligent way, it is possible to the costly breakdowns. The philosophy behind vibration monitoring is to provide reliability, minimise early failures, and provide improved protection to operating personnel. Vibration monitoring has been widely accepted as one of the most powerful parameters which can be employed to diagnose and prevent machinery failures.\n\nThe most commonly used sensor for the vibration monitoring is the piezoelectric accelerometer which converts acceleration forces into an electronic output signal.\n\nAccelerometers are small, robust, and have wide dynamic and frequency ranges.\n\nDisplacement and velocity transducers are limited to narrower ranges of frequencies.\n\nNormally, accelerometers are mounted at carefully selected locations on the stationary structure of machinery. When mounting the accelerometer onto a structure, care should be taken to rigidly secure it by following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWhen selecting an accelerometer, its mounted natural frequency should be at least three times above the highest machine excitation frequency anticipated. Accelerometers should be located at positions which are most likely to provide maximum response to vibrations and at positions which are most likely to provide early indications of wear or failure.\n\nZhan and Makis investigated vibration monitoring used for gearboxes failure detection, and a robust diagnostic model for gearboxes was introduced. It was found that the model was valid using full lifetime vibration signals of gearboxes operating from new to breakdown under a variety of failure modes and demonstrated remarkable advantages over other newly proposed techniques [5].\n\nRobinson [6] developed a method named PeakVue, which focused on the peak value of the vibration signals for fault detection. Chen and Mechefske [7] investigated the Prony model based method and found that it had the potential for analyzing transient vibration signals. Mechefske and Mathew [8,9]  Jun and Suh [10] developed a vibration sensor-based tool breakage detection system for NC milling operations. The system obtained time-domain vibration signals from the sensor attached on the spindle bracket of the CNC machine and declared tool failures through the on-line monitoring schemes. For the on-line detection, their app.roach was to use the statistical process control methods to calculate control limits or thresholds independently from cutting conditions. El-Wardany et al [11] developed vibration-based monitoring methods for detecting breakage of small size drills using the statistic of the kurtosis value in the time domain and the spectrum analysis in the frequency domain.\n\nAccording to Tlisty and Tarng [12], a \"good\" monitoring system has the following requirements: (a) reliability on the safe side, (b) highly automated threshold setting, (c) robustness, (d) practicality of sensor, and (e) fast response. In view of these, El-Wardany proposed a vibration sensor-based monitoring system for tool breakage in NC milling processes, which can be easily implemented with low cost. The vibration sensor is known to be good enough for catastrophic tool breakage detection, although it may not be sufficient for the tool wear monitoring. Considering that the cost and size of the vibration sensor are very attractive, its implement action is promising if a powerful fault detection algorithm can be provided.\n\nSound is discussed here in relation to the monitoring of air-borne pressure waves.\n\nIn the broadest meaning of the word it is a mechanical vibration normally transmitted through a fluid which, when acting upon the ear, produces a sensation on the brain known as hearing [2].\n\nRelevant terms of 'noise' and 'acoustics' have other connotations in diagnostic and electronic terminology which may sometimes cause confusion. Pressure waves applied to the ear at a pleasing tonal frequency are known as sounds. Tonal sounds are musical and involve an expression of melody and harmony. Noise is a random 'sound of any sort' and is not necessarily a musical sound; it involves a combination of different pressure levels which may vary in an irregular manner. 'Acoustics' has also been extended to include solid-borne stress-wave emissions and thus embraces a much broader aspect of the phenomenon than air-borne sound.\n\nSound is a scalar quantity with no directional parameter. Vibration is essentially a vectorial quantity with both magnitude and direction. In practice, the influence of position and direction of the sources of sound in relation to its sensors makes nonsense of the contention that it is only scalar. In fact, positional influences are possibly the largest problem in the diagnostic monitoring of air-bourne sound.\n\nIn a gaseous medium, such as air, the propagation of mechanical vibrations takes place in the form of density variations in the direction of propagation. The most common method of measuring these density variations is to measure the associated variations in pressure.\n\nIf the sound propagates in one direction only it is said to propagate as a plane, free progressive wave or simply as a plane wave. Except for transmission losses in the medium, the root mean value of the sound pressure would then be the same everywhere along the direction of propagation. An approximation to this simple wave can be obtained very far away from a sound source. Another kind of wave is a free spherical progressive wave. Such waves propagate radially away from a small 'pulsating' sphere (a point source). For such a wave the emitted noise power is W, this spreads out from the source in the form of spheres of increasing radius r. If the average noise intensity I is defined as the noise power per unit area:\n\nIn sound monitoring, the sound intensity and sound pressure measurement are different. The sound intensity is a vector quantity, unlike sound pressure which is a scalar quantity. Tandon [13] used a two-microphone method to measure the sound intensity and described the principle of the techniques, the measurement errors, instrumentation and the applications of sound intensity .\n\nAcoustic monitoring in real time is incresingly important since great financial savings are possible, especially in high volume manufacturing. Manufacturers are concerned with increasing yield and reducing costs. Acoustic monitoring of unit manufacturing processes helps alleviate errors during fabrication, thereby increasing yield and ultimately decreasing cost. Acoustic monitoring has been studied by many researcheres. Williams investigated acoustic monitoring of electrochemical deposition and developed a micromachined acoustic sensor for this purpose [14]. Ido and Ciocan performed a study to investigate early failure detection for elastic diaphragms by using an acoustic method. Based on the frequency analysis of the acoustic signal obtained from elastic diaphragms in air-driven pumps, a fully digital system was developed for frequency analysis, and the validity of this method was demonstrated by experiments performed under realistic in-plant conditions [15].\n\nAs mentioned, the sound intensity at a point in an acoustic field is the rate of flow of sound energy crossing a surface of unit area in a given direction. It is thus a vector quantity, unlike sound pressure which is a scalar quantity. Measurement of sound intensity has been attempted by several investigators [13]. The theoretical formulation provided in recent years and the use of digital signal processing techniques and special microphones have now made accurate intensity measurement possible. Sound intensity is easily measured using presently avaiable dual-channel Fast Fourier Transform analysers.\n\nThe two-microphone method [16][17][18][19][20] has proven itself to be considerably faster and more convenient than the conventional traversing probe method [21] for measurement of the one-dimensional acoustic properties of the passive termination in a duct. While the twomicrophone approach form Seybert and Ross [16] involved decomposition of the standing wave pressures into the progressive wave components, it is not necessary in the transfer function approach demonstrated in [17,18,20]. Jammu and Walter [22] detected bearing faults by simultaneously analyzing acoustic signals. While a number of papers have app.eared on different experimental applications and also on error analysis of the two-microphone methods, the theoretical development is sufficiently covered in [16][17][18][19][20][21].\n\nAcoustic absorption, which was neglected in references [16][17][18][19], has been incorporated in [20,21]. Chu [13] has, in fact, shown that acoustic absorption may play a significant role in some cases. However, Chu has neglected the mean flow effect which was considered by others [16][17][18][19]. Li and Mechefske [23] used vibration, motor current and acoustic methods together to detect stator winding and unbalance faults. They found it is highly desirable to employ these three monitoring methods at the same time in order to capture the condition indicating information.\n\nCurrently, the sound intensity technique is being widely used for sound source location and sound power determenation because of certain advantages over other methods. It is shown to be faster and more accurate, compared to the lead-wrapping technique of noise source identification. The measurements can be performed in the near field. Sound power can be determined by the sound intensity technique without the need for an anechoic or reverberation room and, in most cases, even in the presence of stationary backgroud noise. Sound intensity can be easily measured using presently avaiable dual-channel Fast Fourier Transform analyzers. The classification-based approaches use a feature vector, which is determined from a certain class of quality features [27]. In most cases, the use of any signal processing methodology has its goal as one or more of the following: the determination of a suitable 'process model' from which the influence of certain variables can be used to determine the wave state; or the generation of a data feature so that the change in the performance of the wave can be 'tracked'.\n\nAE signals can be classified into two types [28] as either continuous-type AE signals or burst-type. Both are observed during crack growth in the material, tool fracture or chip breakage. The key issue of AE signal processing is to eliminate unwanted noise and to extract feature signals that uniquely correlate with the target process parameters.\n\nThe major advantage of using AE to monitor is that the frequency range of the AE signal is much higher than that of the machine vibrations and environmental noise, and does not overlap in frequency range with vibration testing [26]. The sensitivity of the AE signal to various contact areas and deformation regions has led to AE signals being used as basic tools for fault detection. Methods have been developed for monitoring tool wear in turning [29,30], milling [31], drilling [32,33], boring [34], grinding [35], and forming [36]. Once acoustic emission signatures, thresholds and bandwidth are established for a specific configuration, the AE signal and AE root mean square (RMS) may be monitored and compared to nominal values to detect abnormal events. However, few if any surface integrity parameters including residual stress, microstructure changes [35,37], and surface finish [38] were carefully monitored, except a brief discussion by Toenshoff [27].\n\nYoshioka has shown that AE parameters could detect defects before the defects appear in the vibration acceleration [39][40]. Tandon and Nakra [41] demonstrated the usefulness of some AE parameters, such as, peak amplitude and count, for detection of defects in loaded ball bearings at low and normal speeds. Tan [42] has presented the application of AE for the detection of bearing failures. He has suggested that the measurement of area under the amplitude curve is preferred method for detection of defects in rolling element bearings. Yan et al [43]  It is advantageous to use AE monitoring due to the short data collection and low processing times, rapid and continuous monitoring of performance by a single sensor or several placed in the structure over a long period of time. Droge [44] performed a study of AE failure monitoring for glass-reinforced plastic piping. Adams [45] successfully developed an AE monitoring system for fiberglass tanks/vessels failure detection. Lee et al [46] proposed the two-step detection scheme based on fixed thresholds, which consists of the burst-type acoustic emission (AE) signal detection and cutting force monitoring.\n\nThe disadvantage of AE is that commercial AE systems can only estimate qualitatively how much damage is in the material and approximately how long the components will last. So, other Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) methods are still needed to do more thorough examinations and provide quantitative results. Moreover, service environments are generally noisy, and the AE signals are usually relatively weak.\n\nThus, signal discrimination and noise reduction are difficult, yet extremely important for successful applications.\n\nInterpreting the obtained dynamic signal is a complex process that requires specialized training and experience. One commonly employed technique is to examine the individual frequencies present in the signal. These frequencies correspond to certain mechanical components or certain malfunctions. By examining the frequencies and their harmonics, an analyst can often identify the location and the type of problem, and sometimes the root cause as well. For example, high vibration at the frequency corresponding to the speed of rotation is most often due to residual imbalance and can be corrected by balancing the machine.\n\n(FFT) which is a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis, sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis, is only one aspect of interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on the machines that employ rolling elements and whose failure modes tend to be the degradation of those elements. Typically the machines exhibit an incremental a increase in the amplitude of characteristic frequencies associated with the element geometries and construction. In contrast, depending on the type of a machine, its typical malfunctions, the element types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, a skilled analyst will often need to go through additional diagnostic processes, such as examining the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a timing mark on the machine, historical trends of vibration levels, the over all shape of the vibration signal, and numerous other aspects of the signal.\n\nStewart [47], Shives [48], Randall Various techniques are used in AE signal analysis, such as, spectral analysis, amplitude distribution analysis, autocorrelation function analysis and root mean square calculation. The raw AE signal usually contains high frequency components; therefore it requires signal acquisition equipment capable of signal sampling at high frequency. An appropriate method for analyzing the AE signal based on the root mean square of the signal is often used, this allows with the traditional signal processing systems with much lower sampling frequency [65] to be used for data analysis. The RMS value of the AE signal, which presents the signal energy and has lower frequency content, has been the basis of the analysis carried out by Jemielniak and Otman [66]. However, one should be aware of the nature of the AE signals and be careful when extracting results from the system to avoid processing incorrect or distorted results. This has been studied in detail in previous work [67].\n\nIn this chapter, failure and engineering failure have been defined.\n\nCondition monitoring was introduced and several techniques, such as, temperature monitoring, visual monitoring, wear debris analysis, performance analysis, spectrographic oil analysis, ultrasonic monitoring, have been briefly discussed. As the most common and effective techniques for condition monitoring, vibration-based monitoring techniques, including accelerometer-based, acoustic and acoustic emission monitoring techniques have been reviewed. Advantages and disadvantages of the techniques were addressed.\n\nRelevant state-of-the-art research and applications have been discussed.\n\nFrom the above review, although many researchers have conducted many condition monitoring methods for failure detection in several fields, and they have achieved some success, none of them have performed any condition monitoring diagnostic research on the automotive lamp assembly quality control.\n\nTo automatically test the automotive headlights and taillights, it is necessary to develop an optimal diagnostic system. The main objective of the system is to collect data in order to facilitate the detection and analysis of failures during vibration testing. Thus the amount of meaningful data that can be collected by the system will determine its ultimate success.\n\nThree different methods have been used to detect failures in automotive light assemblies as they undergo shaker table testing. The first one is an accelerometer-based system that can detect the change in dynamic response caused by any cracks, loose or detached components in the assembly. The second failure detection method uses microphones to \"listen\" for any rattling that may be caused by components that have either come loose or have completely detached from the inside of the assembly during shaking. The third method is based on acoustic emission monitoring. This AE monitoring system is able to detect stress wave changes caused by any crack in the automotive light assembly when it is subjected to vibration testing on the shaker table. All three methods should be potentially able to detect faults soon after they develop, collect a sample of the dynamic signal that represents the fault condition and potentially provide the diagnostic condition that could be used to shut down the vibration-testing machine automatically.\n\nThe accelerometer based, microphone based and acoustic emission sensor based diagnostic systems were initially tested in a laboratory environment. Each testing system consists of three main components: 1) shaker table (mechanical vibrator), 2) monitoring hardware (sensors, amplifiers, data acquisition card, oscilloscope, computer, etc.) and 3) diagnostic software (LabVIEW, vibration diagnostic kit, etc.).\n\nThe mechanical vibrator or shaker is used to generate vibrations with a fixed excitation frequency and amplitude to test the durability of the automotive light assembly. A shaker table was previously constructed at Queen's University according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (the SAE) specifications (see Figure 3-1). It is a duplication of the one used by Decoma Autosystems. Figure 3-1: SAE shaker table (Mechanical vibrator) at Queen's University Frame Motor Platform The design and test condition of the shaker table follow specifications set by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [68, 69]. Detail SAE specifications are show in Appendix A and Appendix B. The shaker table consists of a 1.5 HP electrical motor, a frame, a cam and a follower platform. During the testing, the motor drives a cam at a rotation speed of 750±10 rpm, to give a vibration excitation frequency of approximately 12.5 Hz. The amplitude of the oscillations is 3.0±0.25 mm. Figure 3-2 shows the solid model of the shaker table. Figure 3-2: Solid model of SAE shaker table 1. Motor 2. Pillow isolation bl k 3. Follower platform 4. Vertical support rod 5. Spring 6. Screw rod 7. Side fixture plate 8. Frame 9. V-Belt 10. Sheaves 11. Shaft cam The approximate weight of the shaker table is 600lb (272.2 Kg) and its footprint is 2ft (0.6096m) by 4ft (1.2192m). During one revolution of the cam, the table rises by 3.1 mm then falls and plate form and the frame at the front of the shaker table contact [70]. The shaker table sits on four pillow isolation blocks to reduce the vibrations transmitted to the floor, and the tested light assemblies were attached to the follower platform (see Figure 3-3). When the shaker table was installed, it was found that the shaker was very noisy. The noise produced by the shaker table at a distance of one meter from the anvil, was measured to be 89 dB with the ambient noise being 68 dB. It is loud enough to be a disturbance to people who work in the surrounding laboratory space. To reduce the noise, noise absorption material was purchased and installed on the four walls and ceiling of the shaker table enclosure. Also, a carpet was placed on the floor to improve noise absorption (see figure 3-3). Figure 3-3: Shaker table in an enclosure with noise absorption materials installed on the enclosure Switch Timer Noise absorption material Automotive light assembly Shaker table Isolation Block Enclosure\n\nThe sample automotive light assembly, which is tested, is fixed on an aluminum jig, and the jig is fixed on the platform of this shaker table through four screws.\n\nThe monitoring system consists of three main components: sensors/transducers, data collection hardware and data analysis software. For this case, the sensors used are To detect failures, the automotive light assemblies are vibrated with the shaker table. The detected dynamic response of the automotive light assemblies should change\n\nSix common items need to be addressed when selecting transducers: sensitivity, linearity, frequency range, maximum shock, weight, and mounting methods. Particularly for this case, consideration was focused on the frequency range, maximum shock, weight, and mounting methods due to the shock and noise that the transducers are exposed to.\n\nThe selected transducers must have working frequency bands that are able to include the vibration frequencies of the shaker table and light assembly, as well as the frequency of vibrations from failures. The motor drives a cam through \"V\" belts at a rotation speed of 750 ± 10rpm, resulting in a primary vibrating frequency of approximately 12.5 Hz. The vibration frequencies of the light assemblies with failures developing are unknown. According to earlier experiments conducted by Decoma Autosystems, the maximum measured vibration level was approximately 151.4 g.\n\nTherefore, the chosen transducer's maximum shock should be higher than 151.4g, if the transducer is a contacting sensor.\n\nThe weight of a transducer for the testing is an important criterion for transducer selection. Sensors mounted on the light assembly add extra mass to the measured system.\n\nThe mass of a single transducer, the number and the distribution of the transducers may have potential influence on the characteristics of the automotive light assemblies.\n\nConsequently, the total mass of transducers should be as light as possible to reduce their influence. However, smaller transducers usually have lower overall sensitivity (signal to noise ratio) and higher prices. There is no existing rule that suggests the mass ratio between transducer and the measured subject. According to suggestions from the technique personnel from sensor suppliers, the mass ratio of a sensor vs. devices under testing should be less than 1:100. All the automotive lamp assemblies that were used for testing at Queen's University weigh from 0.87 kg (fog light assemblies) to 11.89 kg (head light assemblies). According to the suggestion, the transducer weight should be less than 8.7 grams.\n\nMounting is also an important factor that has to be considered for this project.\n\nThere are four typical mounting methods for transducers (Magnet, Adhesive, Quick fit mount and Mounting stud). Different mountings of a sensor have significant effect on the measurement frequency range. For instance, stud mounting has higher linear frequency response range than a glued mounting.\n\nTransducer mounting limitations include the irregular geometry of the light assemblies, the plastic material of the light assemblies, the curved face and limited accessibility for screw-mountings. The only suitable mounting for the transducers is an adhesive mounting. Therefore, mounting provision for any potential transducers must be adhesive or non-contact.\n\nAdhesive mounting, including indirect and direct adhesive mounting, is often used for temporary installations or where the surface cannot be adequately prepared for stud mounting. Indirect adhesive mounting uses a separate adhesive mounting base to connect the accelerometer to the measurement surface (see Figure 3 Generally speaking, the more adhesive that exists in the joints between the test structure and the transducer, the greater the degradation of transmissibility. Furthermore, the indirect mounting requires a separated adhesive mounting base that brings extra weight. Therefore, the direct adhesive mounting is better than the indirect adhesive mounting in this regard. However, the indirect mounting keeps the transducer clean and free from adhesive, which may be destructive to the transducer. Mounting bases allow a transducer to be easily removed from the test structure without damage to both the sensor Silicone Grease Adhesive Base Adhesive Typical Accelerometer Adhesive and the testing surface. In addition, most adhesive mounting bases provide electrical isolation, which eliminates potential noise pick-up and ground loop problems as well. During testing, oscillation amplitude of the shaker table is relatively large (3.0± 0.25 mm), which requires a strong adhesive for gluing transducers to the automotive lights. However, the transducer needs to be put on and taken off frequently for different tests of different automobile lights, which may be destructive to the transducer. Considering all these factors, the indirect adhesive mounting was the preferred choice for contact sensor for this project. According to the aforementioned selection conditions, three kinds of miniature transducers have been selected: accelerometer 3035A (Dytran Instruments Inc), which measures the vibration signal, microphone 21SB and (G.R.A.S sound & vibration), which catch the sound pressure, and acoustic emission sensor HD50 (Physical Acoustics Corporation (PAC)), which can measure elastic stress wave (Figure 3-6). 21SB and 26AC have same specifications. The 21SB microphone, its preamplifier and its power supplier are together, and the preamplifier and power supplier of 26AC are separate from it. Accelerometer 3035A (Microphone 21SBHD50 AE sensor (Dytran Instruments Inc) (G.R.A.S) (PAC)  Table 3-1: Specifications of selected sensor: Specifications Accelerometer 3035A Microphone 21SB AE sensor HD50 Sensitivity 100 mV/g 50 mV/Pa NA Weight 2.5 gram 310 gram (entire unit) 1 gram Max.

When the shaker table excites the automotive light assembly, it generates multi-frequency vibrations in the assembly through the repeated impacts. If cracks or loose or detached components appear on the light assembly, the characteristic   The collected signals are in the time domain and not convenient for direct observation of failure. Therefore, a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) will be conducted which converts the time domain signals to the frequency domain signals. The FFT has PXI machine  The setup interface shown in Figure 3-11 allows users to setup sampling rate, triggers, and sensors sensitivity. The 3035A accelerometer measurement frequency is up to approximately 5000Hz. During the initial testing, the sampling rate is set as 10,000samples/s with sampling time of 2 seconds.\n\nAcoustic based failure detection is performed by \"listening\" for any rattling that may be caused by components that have either become loose or have completely detached from the inside of the light assembly. In acoustic monitoring, the measurement of sound pressure and the measurement of sound power are different. Sound pressure is a scalar, unlike sound power which is a vector quantity. Single microphone methods measure sound pressure and dual-microphone method has also been used for sound pressure determination. Single microphone-based and two-microphone based diagnostic system setups are described in the following sections.\n\nThe single microphone based diagnostic system is similar to the accelerometer  Figure 3-13: Microphone based diagnostic system data (signals) flow chart Figure 3-14 demonstrates a typical LabVIEW program for microphone-based diagnostic systems. It has similar structures as that of the accelerometer-based system. It can be used for signal acquisition and processing for up to eight microphones if necessary. Microphone & Amplifier Microphone Preamplifier DAQ LabView Display\n\nAs mentioned previously, the noise produced by the shaker table at a distance of one meter from the anvil, was very high. This noise significantly reduces the performance of a single microphone based system. Compared to a sound pressure measurement using the single microphone, the dual microphone method is faster and better, because a dual microphone method can be performed in the near field with much less background noise.  The dual microphone method has two microphones; but otherwise its data collection is the same as single microphone method. However, the dual-microphone method data processing is much more complex than single microphone based system. collection and signal process. Detail LabVIEW program of dual-microphone diagnostic system is shown in Appendix E. The DAQ card collect analogue signal from two microphones. The collected analogue signal are averaged, then DAQ card converts the analogue signal to digital signals, which are processed through LabVIEW program and displayed in the time domain and frequency domain. The time domain data and the mean values were analyzed using FFT (peak), RMS and power spectral density (PSD). Both single microphone channel time domain and frequency domain signals were the two-channel average time domain and frequency domain signals are displayed. This makes the comparisons of the single microphone method graphs and dual microphone method graphs much easier.

Following the initial testing, a decision will be made on which monitoring technique to use for the remainder of the project. The multiple faults demonstrated in  The second simulated failure involved one part of the assembly being loose from the body as shown in Figure 3-23. The white part (power connector) shown in Figure 3-23 was unscrewed from the fog light assembly. Again, these two kinds of failures were suggested by Decoma Autosystems as common failures during vibration testing.\n\nIn this chapter, the design and test conditions of the shaker table have been described. Three types of diagnostic systems: accelerometer-based, acoustic-based, and acoustic emission based systems were introduced. The transducer selections were discussed and justified. The components and testing setup of each system have been explained. The typical structure of LabVIEW data collection and data processing layout was demonstrated. These LabVIEW programs transform the vibration signature from the time domain into the frequency domain. Further data analysis methods used by this project will be introduced in the following chapter.\n\nThe vibration signatures collected from fog light assemblies are complex signals During initial testing, all the data was simply compared in the frequency domain.\n\nAfter analyzing the initial testing results, it was determined which system was most suitable for this project. To get a better understanding of whether a microphone based, accelerometer based or acoustic emission based monitoring system will work for single fault automotive light assembly failure detection, subsequent testing on fog light assemblies with single faults was then conducted. The testing data collected from subsequent tests were processed using different data analysis methods. The primary goal of this investigation of the recorded signals was to determine whether it is possible to distinguish between the \"good\", \" single fault\" and \"multiple fault\" conditions in the baseline test. The following sections will describe the four different data analysis methods which were used in this project.\n\nIn order to see if there are any differences between healthy and faulty signals, 10 single impact time waveforms (in the time domain) for healthy and damaged automotive lamps assemblies were averaged and compared. Since the driving frequency is 12.5Hz, or 0.08 seconds per cycle, the impact signals measured also had 0.08 seconds period time. Reading/Acquiring signals Select single channel (channel J) Aligning and averaging the sampled signal Display and recording Sampling impact for 0.08 seconds from t = 0.08× i second n= 10, i = 1 i = n ? End yes No i=i+1 FFT J = 1 J = 3 ? yes No  The process for each individual channel is identical. Depending on the sampling rate and the time of cycles, the required number of samples of each cycle can be determined. By using two cascaded For-loops in LabVIEW program (see Appendix F), the averaged time domain signal can be obtain at the end of the outer For-loop. It is hard to see the difference between healthy and faulty in time domain, so the averaged time Continuous signal in time domain Truncated single impact Signal aligning Signal averaging t t t t t t 0.08s 0.08s domain signal is convert to the frequency domain. The corresponding frequency domain signal can be displayed on the screen, as well as recorded on the hard drive. The averaged time domain signal is displayed on the screen at the same time. of averaging measured time domain signals from the dual-microphone diagnostic system. Similar to the averaging program for the accelerometer-based system, the program first reads the recorded time domain signals from the hard drive, then selects a signal from each single channel and continues the averaging process. However, for the dual microphone system, the program has one more function which aligns the signals from two channels and then average them. The averaged signal of two channels or microphones is also truncated into single impacts accordingly. Those single impact signals will be realigned in the time domain, and averaged. Finally, the averaged signal will be converted to frequency domain signal through an FFT. Reading/Acquiring signals from two microphones Select single channel (channel J) Aligning and averaging the sampled signal Display and recording Sampling impact for 0.08 seconds from t = 0.08× i second n= 10, i = 1 i = n ? End yes No i=i+1 FFT J = 1 J = 3 ? yes No J=J+1 Averaging signals from the microphones Merge averaged signal as the 3 rd channel\n\nThe precision of an FFT depends on the number of the lines (samples) that are used in the calculation. The higher the number, the more accurate the FFT result will be.\n\nIn order to get better results from FFT calculations within an acceptable calculation time, a tradeoff has to be achieved. In this section, a program has been developed to conduct FFT calculations for a time domain signal within specific time duration.\n\nThe time duration is a variable in the program which users can define accordingly.\n\nHowever, in this particular case, 20 seconds was selected as the time duration. Reading signals for three light assemblies Select single channel for each light assembly Display and recording Merge the signals of the light assemblies from the channel End t= 2s, 20s,… Extract signal with specified duration t program is able to be setup for multiple duration analysis. Three durations were selected for the analyzing: 0.08 second (single impact), 2 seconds, and 20 seconds respectively.\n\nThe program demonstrated in Figure 4-4 reads measured data from three files from three different light assemblies: \"healthy\", \"loose part\", and \"broken leg\".\n\nAfter being converted to the frequency domain by using an FFT, signals are selected by the index of channels, such as, channel 1, channel 2, etc. For the accelerometer-based system, three accelerometers are used simultaneously. For the purpose of comparison, when conducting testing, the accelerometers are located at the same spots on the healthy, loose part, and broken leg lights. For instance, channel 1 (or accelerometer #1) is located on the same geometric spot of the three light assemblies which were originally identical. Therefore, signals measured from channel 1 from all three light assemblies are comparable. The direct way to compare is to display the frequency domain signals (from the same channels) of three light assemblies in the same graph. As discussed in the previous chapter, when any damage appears, the corresponding FFT signal of the damaged light assembly would be different from that of the healthy light assembly and vise versa.  The flow chart of FFT collection LabVIEW program (see Appendix J) demonstrated in Figure 4-6 was developed to process time domain signals of multiple light assemblies measured by the dual microphone diagnostic system. The program reads the data from three files. Each file contains measured time domain signals for one light assembly using two microphones. The second step of the program is to extract a proper Reading signals for three light assemblies Select single channel for each light assembly Display and recording Merge the signals of the light assemblies from the channel End t= 20s Extract signal with specified duration t FFT Averaging signals from the microphones Merge averaged signal as the 3 rd channel Figure 4-7: Flow chart of the FFT calculation and frequency domain signal averaging LabVIEW program for dual-microphone diagnostic system Figure 4-7 is the flow chart of the Labview program developed for the spectrum averaging process for the dual microphone system (see Appendix K). The first step of the program is to read signals from files or acquire signals from microphones. Then Reading signals for a light assembly Summing up with the previous signal and register the summation in the memory Display and recording Averaging the signals End t= 20s…, n =10… Extract signal with specified duration t, from the time i×t FFT Averaging signals from the microphones Merge averaged signal as the 3 rd channel i = n ? yes  In a similar way, to make the comparison easy and visible, the resulting signals of healthy light assemblies and damaged light assemblies are plotted on the same graph. The plotting program used is similar to the program shown in Figure 4-6.\n\nFor this project, it is difficult to observe any difference between healthy light assemblies and faulty light assembly in the time domain directly. However, some  Figure 4-10: Flow chart of the LabVIEW statistic data analysis program for dual microphone-based system Reading signals for a light assembly Display and recording End Select signals from channels Statistic Analysis Display and recording End Select signals from channels Statistic Analysis Reading signals for a light assembly Averaging signals from the microphones\n\nIn this chapter, the data analysis methods are introduced and described. These\n\nFor a vibration system, it is known that if the stiffness and/or mass of the structure change then the vibration characteristics will change as well. Healthy and faulty light assemblies have different vibration characteristics. However, what is not known in this application is whether or not the vibration characteristics of the assembles will be significantly different and whether or not the differences can be detected by using microphone based, accelerometer based or acoustic emission sensor based diagnostic systems.\n\nTo get a better understanding of how well a microphone based, accelerometer based and acoustic emission based monitoring system will work for automotive light assembly failure detection, preliminary experiments have been conducted with multiplefault and healthy fog light assemblies. After analyzing the initial testing results, it was determined which system was most suitable for this project. Subsequent testing on fog light assemblies with single faults was then conducted. The testing data collected from subsequent tests were processed using different data analysis method as described in chapter 4. Testing results and data analysis results will be described and discussed in the following sections.\n\nAs mentioned previously, waiting for an actual failure to occur would have made this initial testing a very time consuming process. Consequently, for the purposes of this project, failures were introduced such that the recording of characteristics of a failed assembly could be made immediately without waiting for an actual failure to occur. For these initial tests, a multiple fault fog light with three failures was used. The three failures of the multiple fog light assembly have been described in chapter 3 (see figure 5-1): one of three legs was broken off, part of the top housing was broken off, and a number of cracks were made in the front lens cover. Since the shaker table generates high background noise levels, it is difficult to see the difference between healthy and damaged automotive light assemblies from the time domain waveforms. Two example time domain signals are shown in Figure 5-2. During initial testing, all the data has been simply compared in the frequency domain visually to distinguish faulty from good. Further analysis of the testing data in the time domain and frequency domain will be shown later.\n\nIn the initial testing, three accelerometers were attached by using \"crazy\" glue to the top, front and back of the automotive light assembly to collect signals from three different locations for both a fault-free assembly and a multi-fault assembly. At first, the sampling rate was set as 20,000 samples/s with a sampling time of 2 seconds. Figure 5-3 is a sample test result in the frequency domain for both the fault-free assembly and multifault assembly using an accelerometer at the same location. Figure 5-3 shows that the signals from the two light assemblies in the frequency domain have a clearly observable difference.\n\nIn the lower frequency range, the differences between the two assemblies are significant, particularly at frequencies of 370Hz, 750Hz, 900Hz, 1300Hz, and 1600Hz. At frequency is higher than 3000Hz, the differences between the two assemblies are rapidly reduced and became insignificant.\n\nSince accelerometers show more difference at lower frequency (<3000Hz), the sampling rate was changed to10000 samples/sec and the plotted frequency range changed to 5 to 5000Hz to make the difference more visible.\n\nIt was found that the collected signals were repeatable and stable for each As expected, it was found that the signals from the accelerometers were very sensitive to the mounting location. At different mounting locations, the collected signals are quite different.  Healthy Fog light (mounting location 4) Faulty Fog light (mounting location 4)\n\nFurther testing was conducted in order to find the most sensitive mounting locations. Thirty-two different locations were tested (Figure 5-4). After comparing the measured responses from these locations, six mounting locations for accelerometer-based testing were identified to provide best signals. The reason for location sensitivity is that different locations have different surface geometry, which results in different angles between the sensing axis of the accelerometers and the acceleration of the shaker. Consequently, with the same acceleration, forces exerted on the sensors will result in different output magnitudes.\n\nOne of the challenges for the accelerometer based diagnostic system is mounting adhesive. Three kinds of adhesives: wax, permanent double-sided tape and \"crazy\" glue have been tried. The wax and the permanent double-sided tape could not hold the accelerometer firmly when the fog light assemblies were shaken on the shaker table. The 10mm 75mm 144mm 42mm 44mm 56mm \"crazy\" glue was strong enough to hold the accelerometer on, but it is difficult to get it off the fog light surface. Removal of the adhesive leaves a trace mark on the surface (Figure 567). Gripper TM super glue remover was used to clean off the \"crazy\" glue trace on the automotive light assembly surface.\n\nInitially, a single microphone based monitoring system was used to collect data for both fault free fog light assemblies and multiple fault fog light assemblies. Figure 5678shows a sample signal in the frequency domain. The single microphone based system shows some difference between the fault-free fog light assembly and multiple-fault fog light assembly. The difference is repeatable, but is not significant. The reason for this is the high background noise level from the shaker table. Considering that the microphone is a non-contact method, more investigation has been done. A two-microphone method was also used for sound power determination [71].\n\nCorresponding testing was conducted with dual-microphones (G.R.A.S. 21SB and G.R.A.S. 26AC) (see Figure 56789). In the first test the microphones were arranged with a face angle of approximate 60°. The time domain data from the two microphones were averaged and the mean values have been analyzed using RMS FFT and PSD FFT.\n\nComparisons of the results demonstrated that the dual-microphone method is able to detect some differences and this dual-microphone method is better than the single microphone based monitoring system.  Compared to the single microphone method, dual-microphone method can detect more visible difference between damaged and healthy automotive light assemblies, but the difference is still not significant when the two microphones face angle is 60°. To get a better understanding about the dual-microphone method, more testing of the two  In Figure 5-11 the blue signals were collected from healthy light assemblies and the red signals from multiple fault assembly. Comparing the results between 90° and\n\n180° face angle, the dual microphone based system shows more significant difference when the two microphones face angle is 180° compared to 90°.\n\nComparing all testing results collected from different face angles, the face angle of 180° is the best for the dual microphone system. At this face angle the most significant difference between a fault-free fog light assembly and a multiple-fault fog light assembly was clearly observable. Particularly, a clear difference is located between 300 Hz and 5500 Hz.\n\nThe most significant problem for the dual-microphone based monitoring system is the high background noise level produced by the shaker table. A more sophisticated approach to help distinguish the signals representing faulty and fault free conditions may need to be considered. For instance, future work should involve using a frequency controllable vibration testing system to get the natural vibration characteristics for the automotive light assemblies. Once the natural frequency characteristics are obtained, filtering the noise in the appropriate frequency bands may be useful to reduce the background noise and highlight the defect frequencies [72].\n\nInitial testing on the shaker table using the acoustic emission (AE) sensor HD50 has been conducted. The AE sensor was attached to a fog light by using \"crazy\" glue. A thin layer of wax was added between the base and the stud of the sensor to improve surface connectivity and to ensure good stress wave transmission. This acoustic emission based diagnostic system could observe some difference between healthy and damaged fog light assemblies when they were subject to vibration testing. Figure 5-12 shows the difference between a healthy fog light assembly signal and a damaged fog light assembly signal. Although the AE sensor HD50 has a frequency range of 359 to 880 kHz, the sampling frequency could only reach lower than 60 kHz due to the limitation of current data hardware. The limitations are as follows:\n\n1) The RS232 driver program from HP (Agilent) cannot read 1.76 million sampling points from oscilloscope (maximum that RS232 driver program can transfer is about 450 thousand sampling points);\n\n2) LabVIEW program cannot process even 450K samples at a time due to the error: \"out of LabVIEW memory\".\n\nThe AE sensor's upper sensing frequency is 880 kHz, requiring at least 1.76M\n\nsamples/s-sampling rate, which is far lower than the sample rate of the oscilloscope (200\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nFrequency (Hz) M samples/s). To get enough samples for analysis, at least 1.76M samples should be collected.\n\nAE transducers are designed to detect the very high frequency (> 50 kHz) stress waves that are generated when cracks extend under load. Generation and propagation of cracks are among the primary sources of AE in metals. One of the advantages of AE monitoring is that it can detect the growth of subsurface cracks. For this project, most of the material in the automotive light assembly is plastic. Hence, the acoustic emission sensor based diagnostic system is not particularly suitable for this project. No further testing with AE sensors is recommended in the future, since the high frequencies (offered by the AE sensor) are of little interest (or value) for this particular type of application.\n\nIn summary, the initial testing and all processing signals have demonstrated that the accelerometer based and dual-microphone methods have good potential for automotive light assembly failure detection. Further testing and analysis of these two testing methods was conducted and the following section shows the results.\n\nOne concern regarding the reliability of the sensors has to be considered. During the preliminary testing, the shaker table only ran less than one minute (long enough to get enough data for the testing) and only collected a maximum of 2 seconds of data. In the real scenario, testing lasts for at least an hour. The sensor mountings are not checked for long periods of running time. In order to make a final decision on the best fault detection system, further testing with single fault light assembly and improvement of LabVIEW programs were required. Subsequent testing on fog light assemblies with single faults was conducted by using accelerometer based and dual-microphone based diagnostic systems.\n\nTwo kinds of single fault fog light assemblies, which were suggested by Decoma Autosystems (described in chapter 3), were used in subsequent test: a) broken leg fog light assembly with a crack, as shown in figure 5   Due to the PXI machine memory limitation, only limited data can be collected. In order to observe more data for analysis, only time domain waveform signals were collected and recorded. The maximum data collecting time was 45 seconds for the accelerometer-based system and 25 seconds for the dual-microphone based diagnostic\n\nThe subsequent testing data are analyzed in the time and frequency domain by The results from different data analysis methods were compared to see which methods were more suitable for this project. Some example data analysis result signals are shown.\n\nTen (10) single impact time domain waveforms measured from healthy and single fault fog light assemblies were averaged (using the summation of the corresponding components and dividing by 10). Comparison was made between the averaged results of healthy and single fault fog light assemblies. Due to the reasons mentioned above, it was believed that this data analysis method might not work for longer time signal either. Therefore relevant signal processing was not be further pursued for the following cases: Original signal Averaged signal Original signal Averaged signal i) Average of 2 seconds of time domain waveform data and the average of 45 seconds time domain waveform data for the accelerometer based diagnostic system.\n\nii) Average single impact, average of 2 seconds or average of 20 seconds of time domain waveform data for the dual-microphone based diagnostic system.\n\nIn this subsection, time domain waveforms with durations of 0.08 seconds (one single impact), 2 seconds and 20 seconds for healthy and damaged fog light assemblies have been converted into frequency domain spectra by using an FFT. The comparison between frequency domain spectra of healthy and damaged fog light assemblies has been conducted. The results of accelerometer and dual microphone based systems will be separately described in the following sections. and damaged fog light assemblies with accelerometers located at three different locations.\n\nThe green signals are from healthy fog light testing and the purple signals are from broken leg assembly. Differences between the healthy and damaged fog light assemblies at the same mounting location can be observed from Figure 5-16, however, such differences are not repeatable. For instance, signals measured at locations #2 and #5 illustrate significant differences between the healthy and faulty light assembly at a frequency of 800Hz, but the differences at locations #2 and #5 are not identical. The signals at location #6 do not show any obvious differences between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate frequency spectra from longer time domain waveforms to make a final decision if this data analysis method has good potential. Healthy Broken leg Healthy Broken leg Healthy Broken leg (a) FFT spectra from mounting location 2 (b) FFT spectra from mounting location 5  assemblies from 2-second time domain waveforms at locations #2, #5 and #6. Similar to the results shown in Figure 5-16, the signals at location #2 and #5 have observable differences at frequencies of approximately 800 Hz, 2500Hz, and 3000Hz respectively. When the frequency is higher than 4250Hz, there is no observable difference any more from these two locations. It is difficult to use the signals measured from the location #6 to differentiate healthy and faulty light assemblies even though it has a slight difference at the frequency of 800Hz.

However, the differences between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies are not identical at different locations. Consequently, it is optimistic to say that there is good potential to distinguish healthy and faulty automotive light assemblies when using spectrum signals of the accelerometer-based system for longer time (>2s) samples.\n\nThe spectra signals from the dual-microphone based system were calculated from   microphone system with sample durations of 2 seconds and 20 seconds.  In Figure 5-20, the yellow and purple signals are for healthy and faulty (with loose part) fog light assemblies respectively. In Figure 5-21, the green and purple signals Healthy Loose part Healthy Loose part are for healthy and faulty fog light assemblies respectively. Figures 5-20 and 5-21\n\ndemonstrate the observable difference between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies, consistently between 3000Hz and 9500Hz. In general, it can be stated that this system is potentially capable of detecting the failures in automotive light assemblies using frequency spectra of time domain waveforms of two microphones from the dualmicrophone based diagnostic system. Furthermore, the duration of the sampling time should be 2 seconds or longer.\n\nIn this section, frequency spectra will be averaged and compared between healthy and faulty light assemblies. Ten frequency spectra will be averaged simply by using their summation divided by the number of spectra (10). Each frequency spectrum comes from a time domain waveform with different duration. Particularly, for the accelerometerbased system, durations are 0.08 and 4 seconds, and for the dual-microphone based system, the duration is 20 seconds. The averaged frequency spectra will be discussed separately for dual-microphone and accelerometer based systems in the following sections.\n\nIn this subsection, frequency spectra from accelerometer-based system will be averaged. The signals are measured at locations #2, #5, and #6. Figure 5-22 demonstrates the averaged signals with duration of 0.08 second (one single impact). The green and purple signals are for healthy and faulty (with broken leg) fog light assemblies respectively. At location #2, difference can be observed below 1000Hz. There is no significant difference at higher frequencies. At location #5, some minor differences can be observed at 100Hz and within the 2000 Hz to 4500Hz band. At location #6, differences can be identified from 800 to 2600Hz. For other frequency ranges it is difficult to identify clear differences.

The results of the frequency spectra show that most noticeable differences are below 4000 Hz. Therefore, for better presentation in plots, only the lower frequency portion of the frequency spectra averaged signals will be plotted.\n\nThe average signals are calculated from ten single impact frequency spectra of 0.08 second (duration of a single impact) and 2 second time domain waveforms. A healthy and faulty (with a loose part) fog light assemblies have been tested.   seconds for each time domain waveform. The green and blue signals are for healthy and Therefore, the spectrum-averaging method is more effective for the dual-microphone based system. Overall, it can be concluded that the frequency spectra averaging method has good potential for both accelerometer based and dual-microphone based systems. The method is effective at identifying differences between signals that represent faulty versus healthy parts.\n\nIn this section, some statistical measures from the time domain signals have been investigated. The statistic parameters of the waveforms include the Arithmetic mean (µ), Standard Deviation (SD), Kurtosis (K), Skewness (S) and root mean square. The Healthy Loose part waveform durations vary and include 0.08 seconds, 2 seconds, 20 seconds (microphone system) and 45 seconds (accelerometer system) continuous time waveform signals.\n\nTable 5-1 lists some example statistical results of the dual-microphone based system. Table 5-2 lists some example statistical results of the accelerometer-based system. It is difficult to evaluate the differences between healthy and faulty fog lights from the pure data as listed in Table 5-1 and in Table 5-2. The full list of the accelerometer based diagnostic system statistical data results are included in the Appendix O (2 second duration results) and Appendix P (45 second duration results), and the full list of dual-microphone based statistical data results are included in the Appendix Q (20 second duration results). To present the differences more effectively, the data have been plotted in a bar  waveform at the mounting location #2 and 45-second time domain waveform at the mounting location #5. The Skewness and Arithmetic Mean have been plotted separately.\n\nStatistical results of 2 second time domain data for mounting location 2 of accelerometer -2.00E+00 0.00E+00 2.00E+00 4.00E+00 6.00E+00 8.00E+00 1.00E+01 1.20E+01 1.40E+01 1.60E+01 A r i t h m e t i c M e a n R M S S t a n d a r d D e v K u r t o s i s S k e w n e s s Statistical results Healthy location 2 Broken leg location 2 Lose part location 2 Skewess of 2 second time domain data for mounting location 2 of accelerometer 0.00E+00 2.00E-01 4.00E-01 6.00E-01 8.00E-01 1.00E+00 1.20E+00 1.40E+00 Skewness Skewess Healthy location 2 Broken leg location 2 Lose part location 2 Arithmetic Mean of 2 second time domain data for mounting location 2 of accelerometer -6.00E-04 -5.00E-04 -4.00E-04 -3.00E-04 -2.00E-04 -1.00E-04 0.00E+00 Arithmetic Mean Arithmetic Mean Healthy location 2 Broken leg location 2 Lose part location 2 Statistical results of 45 second time domain signal at the accelerometer mounting loction #5 -1.00E+00 0.00E+00 1.00E+00 2.00E+00 3.00E+00 4.00E+00 5.00E+00 6.00E+00 7.00E+00 8.00E+00 9.00E+00 A r i t h m e t i c M e a n R M S S t a n d a r d D e v K u r t o s i s S k e w n e s s Statistical results Healthy location 5 Broken leg location 5 Lose part location 5 Skewess of 45 second time domain signal at the accelerometer mounting loction 5 -4.00E-02 -2.00E-02 0.00E+00 2.00E-02 4.00E-02 6.00E-02 8.00E-02 1.00E-01 1.20E-01 Skewness Skewess Healthy location 5 Broken leg location 5 Lose part location 5 Arithmetic Mean of 45 second time domain signal at the accelerometer mounting loction 5 -2.00E-04 -1.00E-04 0.00E+00 1.00E-04 2.00E-04 3.00E-04 Arithmetic Mean Arithmetic Mean Healthy location 5 Broken leg location 5 Lose part location 5 Figure 5-27: Histogram of statistical results of 45-second time domain signal at the accelerometer mounting location #5. Figures 5-26 and 5-27 show that kurtosis (K) and Arithmetic Mean were significantly different between healthy and damaged fog light assemblies. However, Skewness shows some difference at some of mounting locations only. RMS and standard deviation do not show visible difference at any mounting locations. In general, the kurtosis (K) and Arithmetic Mean may be useful for failure detection for automobile light assembly; Skewness, RMS and standard deviation have less potential for accelerometer based system data analysis. second time domain signals of the averaged time domain signals from the two microphones.

The ratios clearly show the differences. For instance, Arithmetic Mean of healthy light assembly at location 1 is only 76.1 percent of that of broken leg light assembly. However, it is relatively inconsistent at various locations. For instance, the Arithmetic Mean ratios of healthy and broken leg light assemblies vary from 50.2% at location 5, to 133% at location 7. The ratios of other parameters show a similar attribution as well.  Table 5-5 and Table 5-6 display the details of the ratios of statistical measures for 45-second time domain signals at different locations between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies. Similarly to Table 5-3 and Table 5-4, the ratios clearly show the significant differences. But it is still inconsistent at various locations even though duration of the signal is much longer (45 seconds).\n\nIn this subsection, comparisons among statistical results for time domain signals  Table 5-7 demonstrates that significant differences between statistical measures can be observed for the signals with duration of 2-second measured use dual microphone system between healthy and damaged fog light assemblies. For instance, the Arithmetic mean of such signals of a healthy light assembly is about 7 times larger than that of a loose part light assembly.  seconds. It is clear that except the Arithmetic means and Kurtosis, have changed significantly, the other parameters, i.e., RMS, Standard Deviation, and Skewness were relatively consistent between H/B and H/L. Therefore, Arithmetic Mean and Kurtosis were good for failure diction, the rest three has less potential.\n\nFour data analysis methods were investigated. The time domain waveform data averaging method does not work for this project. The frequency spectra of healthy and faulty light assemblies, converted from time domain signals using FFT, demonstrate some differences. However, the differences are not consistent if the time domain signal is of short duration (less than 2 seconds). Converting the time domain signals to frequency domain spectra using FFT has good potential for this project, especially when longer (over 2 seconds) time domain signals are used which tend to produce more repeatable analysis results. The averaged frequency spectra of healthy and faulty light assemblies, converted from time domain signals, show significant differences. Compared to single spectrum analysis, this method produces more consistent results. Furthermore, it was found that the more frequency spectra that are averaged, the better quality of the results and the easier to detect failures from the light assemblies.\n\nSome statistical parameters calculated from the time domain signals have shown potential to detect failures. Kurtosis (K) and Arithmetic Mean of the time domain signals can distinguish healthy and faulty fog light assemblies with a significant difference (i.e., ratios of Arithmetic Mean and Kurtosis are 291% and 80% for H/B with 2-second dual microphone signals). Skewness of the time domain signals cannot consistently distinguish healthy and faulty light assemblies. RMS and Standard deviation are not able to differentiate the healthy and faulty light assemblies. A brief list of the effectiveness of all methods for the project is organized in the Table 5-9.\n\n• \"×\" means does not work for this project,\n\n• \"√\" means it has potential but has some problem need to pay attention when use it;\n\n• \"√√\" means this method have very good potential.\n\nIn this chapter, preliminary testing with multiple fault fog light assembly by using In brief, the author has contributed the following to the project: transducer selection, failure detection system design, preliminary and subsequent testing, and data processing and analyzing.\n\nBased on the conducted work, the following conclusions have been drawn:\n\n1). The accelerometer-based system is able to detect failures in automotive light assemblies.\n\n2). Location of accelerometers is critical to measurement performance.\n\n3). The dual-microphone based system is able to detect failures in automotive light assemblies. The averaged signal of the two microphones is required to be the signal for analyzing. The face angle between the two microphones should be 180 degrees.\n\nDuring testing and signal processing, it was found that eliminating noise was a key part of the research. If the natural frequencies of a light assembly can be identified, it will be helpful to use filters to reduce or eliminate noise accordingly. In order to do so, it is recommended that a VT150 vibration system (See Figure 6-1) should be employed The VT150 vibration system can generate the same vibration as the shaker table can; however it has much lower noise due to an embedded B-1 Blower which\n\nincorporates a sound absorption system to reduce its noise level to less than 70 dB (VTS).\n\nCombined with accelerometers and microphones, the VT150 vibration system can be used to determine the natural resonant frequencies of automotive light assemblies.\n\nKnowing the natural frequencies of the light assemblies, it is possible to reduce the noise and amplify the desired signal effectively. The natural characteristics of the light assemblies also can be used in future data analysis and modeling.\n\nVT 150 vibration testing system in vibration diagnostic lab includes a signal generator, vibrator, power supply and oscilloscope. Some automotive light assemblies and their jig load beyond the vibrator's support load, so a load support was required. The load support has been made and installed by the manufacturer.\n\nThe above recommended testing will be conducted with the three-3035A\n\naccelerometers system and the two microphones 21SB and 26AC based diagnostic systemS that have been described in chapter 3.\n\nThe descriptions and specifications of VT150 single vibrator, 54645 Oscilloscope and HP 3312A function generator are in Appendix R (VTS), Appendix S (TESTEQUITY), and Appendix T (WIKIPEDIA) respectively.
