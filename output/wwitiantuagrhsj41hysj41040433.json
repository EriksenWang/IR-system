    "full_text": "The critical importance of precipitation in the surface hydrological budget of the Earth is self-evident, regardless of whether one is primarily concerned with climate-scale, regional, or local hydrology. Unfortunately, the extreme transience and spatial inhomogeneity of rainfall also makes it one of the most challenging variables to quantify as an input to hydrological models, particularly in regions for which surface gauge and radar observations are sparse (Foufoula-Georgiou & Krajewski, 1995;Petty, 1995).\n\nOver such regions, which in fact comprise the vast majority of the Earth's surface, meteorological satellites provide the only realistic means to monitor the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation with anything approaching the accuracy and spatial detail required by hydrologists. Yet, while satellites offer a sampling density that is impossible to achieve globally by any other means, this advantage must be weighed against the inherent indirectness of satellite observables (e.g. cloud top reflectance or thermal radiance) as measures of surface precipitation intensity. Consequently, the calibration of satellite rainfall estimation algorithms and their global applicability remain important issues.\n\nThis paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of precipitation estimation from space, draws attention to sources and characteristics of commonly available satellite-derived precipitation products, and summarizes the results of recent efforts to quantify the performance of various classes of satellite rainfall estimation techniques. The focus is strictly on those satellite algorithms and products relevant to land surface hydrology. The issues of spatial and temporal sampling, especially as they bear on hydrological applications, will be discussed. The results (in some cases preliminary and incomplete) from several recent major algorithm intercomparison/validation projects will be summarized. General discussion of methodological issues of the calibration and validation problems completes the paper. Finally, it bears noting that, due to space limitations, attention has been restricted to the peer-reviewed literature and, occasionally, official agency reports.\n\nAll meteorological satellites currently used routinely for precipitation estimation are either geostationary or polar-orbiting, sun-synchronous satellites. Table 1 summarizes the features of those satellites and sensors commonly used in precipitation estimation over land. Geostationary satellites (e.g. GOES, GMS, Meteosat) typically carry infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) imagers with surface resolutions ranging from 1-4 km. NÛÂÂ polar orbiters carry VIS/IR imagers with -1 km resolution, while several of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) polar orbiting satellites carry the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I; Hollinger et al., 1987), with resolution on the order of 10 km.\n\nThe choice of polar-orbiting vs geostationary platforms for precipitation estimation entails several tradeoffs with regard to temporal and spatial sampling and geographical coverage: a geostationary satellite positioned over the equator can provide high frequency (hourly or better) images of a portion of the tropics and middle latitudes, while a polar orbiter provides roughly twice-daily coverage of the entire globe. Polar orbiters also fly in a low Earth orbit which is more suitable for the deployment of microwave imagers on account of the latter's coarse angular resolution. Note: Polar orbiters generally sample a given location twice daily, or less often for sensors with narrow swaths, such as the SSM/I. Geostationary imagers typically observe the full Earth disk at least hourly, although standard precipitation products often utilize only 3-hourly images.\n\nThe choice of spectral band for observing precipitation also involves tradeoffs. Historically, infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) imagery have been widely available for the longest period of time, with high quality microwave (MW) imagery becoming widely available only after the launch of the SSM/I in 1987.\n\nAdvantages of the VIS and IR bands include high spatial resolution as well as the possibility of frequent temporal sampling from geostationary platforms. A major disadvantage is the indirectness of the relationship between cloud top albedo or temperature and surface precipitation rate. The evidence to date suggests that VIS/IR methods produce highly smoothed depictions of instantaneous rainfall fields which become useful only when averaged over larger space and/or time scales, and then only when carefully calibrated for the region and season in question.\n\nMicrowave radiometers such as the SSM/I have been shown to yield more reliable information concerning instantaneous precipitation rates on account of their ability to \"see\" through cloud tops and detect directly the presence of actual precipitation particles within and below the clouds. However, despite the greater physical directness of microwave methods as compared with infrared and visible techniques, they still do not respond to surface precipitation rate so much as to a weighted vertical integration of rain and/or ice water content, which may or may not be well correlated with surface rain intensity in any given case (Smith et al., 1992).\n\nParticularly over land, whose bright microwave emission is difficult to distinguish from emission by liquid water suspended aloft, the sensitivity of the SSM/I to precipitation lies primarily in the 85.5 Ghz channels and is traceable to scattering of the relatively short wavelength (3.5 mm) radiation by frozen precipitation particles in the upper portions of cold clouds (Gasiewski, 1993). Not all rain-bearing clouds contain such ice particles, however, and the mean relationship between the concentration of ice, when present, and surface precipitation undoubtedly varies from season to season and region to region.\n\nPerhaps the single most important limitation of the SSM/I follows from its deployment on polar orbiting satellites. Consequently, estimates of average rainfall at a location must be based on one or two \"snapshots\" per day per satellite. This poor temporal sampling greatly reduces the precision with which short term (i.e. days to weeks) precipitation totals can be estimated, especially at fine spatial resolution (McConnell & North, 1987;Bell et al., 1990). Furthermore, the sun-synchronous crossing times of individual polar orbiters preclude a representative sampling of any diurnal variations in mean precipitation, thus creating at least the potential for significant systematic biases in long term estimated rainfall totals. Obviously, the deployment of multiple microwave radiometers with differing crossing times helps mitigate the above sampling problems.\n\nFinally, a long-recognized source of uncertainty in the estimation of rain rate from microwave radiances is the coarse spatial resolution (>10 km) of current generation microwave imagers relative to the typical horizontal scales of variability of hydrometeor distributions in rain bearing clouds. Observed radiances thus represent an average of a nonlinear function of the spatially varying rain rate (Wilheit, 1986). More recently, the geometrical effects of three-dimensional rain clouds on radiances observed by an oblique viewing radiometer such as the SSM/I have been examined and have been found to be non-negligible (Haferman et al, 1994, Petty, 1994, Robert! et al., 1994).\n\nThere is a large number of satellite rainfall estimation algorithms documented in the literature. For example, 55 algorithms were evaluated in the recent Third Algorithm Intercomparison Project (AIP-3) of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), including 16 VIS/1R, 29 MW and 10 mixed IR/MW algorithms. Here, limited by space, a few particularly well-documented algorithms are highlighted as examples of the most important current classes of techniques.\n\nAlmost all IR techniques are based on variations of the premise that precipitation is most likely to be associated with deep clouds and thus with cold cloud tops, as observed by an infrared imager. Visible cloud albedos are generally used, if at all, as supplemental information to discriminate cold clouds which are optically thin and presumably non-precipitating from those which are optically thick and therefore possibly precipitating. Of course, visible imagery is only usable during the time that the sun is high above the horizon. IR-only methods are often preferred for the simple reason that their performance is less likely to be a strong function of the time of day and therefore less likely to introduce spurious day-night biases in estimated precipitation.\n\nBecause rainfall usually occupies only a small fraction of the cold or bright cloud area visible from space, VIS/IR algorithms tend to overestimate significantly actual rain area. To avoid systematic overestimates in temporal or spatial averages, this tendency is usually accounted for by assigning very low rain rates (empirically derived) to the area identified as precipitating in the instantaneous images.\n\nThe GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) (Arkin & Meisner, 1987;Arkin et al., 1994) is one of the simplest and most widely used IR indices of precipitation in the tropics and subtropics. The GPI is computed by simply taking the fraction of pixels within a region whose IR brightness temperatures are less than some threshold, T Q , and multiplying that fraction by a constant rain rate, R Q . Most commonly, T 0 is taken to be 235°K and J? 0 is taken to be 3.0 mm h\" 1 . However, other values for these parameters may be more appropriate in some cases, depending on location, season, spatial averaging scale and other factors.\n\nAlthough the GPI is designed for use with geostationary IR imagery, it has also been applied to AVHRR imagery in order to fill in holes in the coverage of the low to middle latitudes by geostationary platforms.\n\nThe Negri-Adler-Wetzel Technique (NAWT) (Negri et al, 1984) is an IR method based on the Griffith-Woodley technique (Griffith et al., 1978) but without the time-history dependent terms of the latter. NAWT assigns rain rates to \"cloudy pixels\" based on a threshold brightness temperature, T 0 , which was originally taken to be 253 °K but has been modified in more recent versions of the algorithm. Of the area defined as cloud, the coldest 10% is assigned a rain rate J? 10 and the next coldest 40% is assigned a lower rain rate R 40 . Values for R w and R 40 were originally specified as 8 and 2 mm n 1 , respectively, but have been adjusted slightly in more recent applications.\n\nThe Convective-Stratiform Technique (CST) (Adier & Negri, 1988) attempts to associate convective entities with the location of minima in the infrared brightness temperature field. The gradient of T B is used to determine whether the minima are associated with true convective \"cores\" or merely with non-precipitating cirrus debris. Rain rate and rain area are assigned to the convective cores based on calculations from a one-dimensional cumulus model, with corrections for the height of the tropopause. The statistics of the infrared image are used to determine the tropopause height and the threshold temperature for stratiform rainfall, which is assigned a fixed rain rate.\n\nMAINSÀT is a supervised classification algorithm which is trained to identify areas of precipitation from a combination of VIS and IR imagery (Lovejoy & Austin, 1979;Bellonef al., 1980;Hogg, 1990;King et al, 1989). Training data include summertime surface radar observations from southern Ontario. At night, visible imagery is unavailable and RAINS AT reverts to a pure IR technique. RAINS AT and its relatives are among the few VIS/IR algorithms that are used operationally in middle latitudes. Recently, Tsonis et al. (1995) and Guetter et al. (1995) proposed a similar approach by using a multivariate classification scheme and raingauge data to estimate daily mean areal precipitation. They demonstrated the hydrological utility of the scheme by using a rainfall-runoff model for a large basin.\n\nAs noted earlier, the signature of precipitation in microwave radiances over land lies principally in the scattering properties of precipitation-sized ice particles aloft. When such particles are present, as is most often the case in deep, precipitating clouds, the bulk thermal emissivity of the cloud, and thus the observed microwave radiance, is dramatically reduced relative to the radiometrically \"warm\" land background. There are diverse methods for distinguishing this signal against a background characterized by spatially and temporally variable emissivity and temperature and for mapping the observed radiometric signal to a rain rate. The following are the most commonly encountered representatives of the major classes of algorithms: SRL Scattering index The Satellite Research Laboratory (SRL) of NOAA-NESDIS uses an empirically derived function of the lower frequency channels of the SSM/I to predict vertically polarized 85.5 GHz brightness temperatures expected in the absence of precipitation (Grody, 1991;Ferraro et al., 1994). The depression of the observed brightness temperature relative to this predicted brightness temperature is the Scattering Index (SI) and is mapped empirically to rain intensity (Ferraro & Marks, 1995), once other scatterers, such as surface snow cover or desert sand, have been ruled out.\n\nConceptually similar algorithms have been formulated by other authors (e.g. Kidd & Barrett, 1990) in terms of the simple difference between vertically polarized 85.5 and 37 GHz channels of the SSM/I. Here, the 37 GHz brightness temperature effectively replaces the empirical multichannel function utilized in SI, based on the observation that emissivity variations over land are generally similar for both frequencies, except where scatterers such as precipitation are present.\n\nThe Goddard Scattering algorithm (GSCAT) was first published by Adler et al. (1993) and updated by Adler et al. (1994). In this algorithm, an empirical logic tree applied to multi-channel information is used in order to make the initial determination of whether rain may be present in a pixel. For those pixels classified as raining, the rain rate is computed as a linear function of the horizontally polarized 85.5 GHz brightness temperature, based on radiative transfer calculations applied to numerical cloud model results.\n\nBristol algorithms Kidd & Barrett (1990) described a modification of the so-called polarization-corrected temperature (PCT) (Spencer et al., 1989) from the SSM/I's 85.5 GHz channels as a basis for the estimation of precipitation over both land and water. The PCT is a linear combination of the vertical and horizontal polarizations that largely eliminates the contrast between land and water or wet surfaces and thus yields a precipitation signal whose interpretation does not strongly depend on the background surface type (scatterers excepted). The exact linear operator used to derive PCT must vary slightly to account for regional variations in surface temperature and other parameters; one approach is to use empirical coefficients that have been determined for each month as a function of geographic location over the entire globe. This helps minimize the impact of variations in background parameters on precipitation estimates.\n\nHydrometeor profile retrieval algorithms A much more ambitious class of algorithms exists which takes a physically detailed approach to rainfall estimation by modifying assumed vertical profiles of hydrometeors (rain water, graupel and snow, cloud water, etc.) until model-calculated multichannel brightness temperatures approximately match observed brightness temperatures. The surface rain rate is then obtained from the rainwater concentration in the lowest layer. The obvious advantage is that the retrieval method is grounded in known physical principles rather than purely statistical relationships of questionable robustness. Drawbacks include significantly greater complexity and computational burden relative to simpler methods, and the difficulty of reliably specifying or parameterizing some of the physical variables to which the forward model calculations (and thus the retrievals) are sensitive. Examples of the latter include subpixel-scale inhomogeneity in rain intensities, radiative consequences of the three-dimensional structure of rain clouds (especially when viewed obliquely), and the uncertain and highly variable microphysical and electromagnetic characteristics of the frozen and liquid hydrometeors comprising rain clouds. Given the number of radiatively important degrees of freedom in the forward problem, even the most physically sophisticated algorithms still depend -either explicitly or implicitlyon empirically determined relationships between variables in order to constrain the retrieval.\n\nWell known profile retrieval algorithms include those described by Kummerow & Giglio (1994a,b) and by Mugnai & Smith (1988), Mugnai et al. (1993) and Smith et al. (1994).\n\nIt was noted earlier that IR algorithms suffer principally from physical indirectness, while SSM/I-derived daily rainfall estimates are most severely impacted by infrequent sampling. Algorithms which attempt to combine the benefits of frequent IR imagery from geostationary satellites with the more physically direct detection of precipitation by microwave methods are under development. The most common approach is to assume that the once-or twice-daily SSM/I rain rates are sufficiently accurate so as to permit the regular updating of regional calibration relationships for an IR based method such as the GPI (Adler et al., 1994;Xie & Arkin, 1996). The main benefit should be a significant reduction in systematic regional or seasonal biases in the IR-derived mean rainfall. Of course, to be successful, the microwave estimates themselves must be relatively free of biases.\n\nFrom a more general point of view, merging can be done at the product level, or through assimilation of the observables into the hydrological model or data system. The merging at the product level involves an optimal combination of the satellite based estimates with estimates coming from other sources. Advantages of this approach are significant if the two sensors used have complementary characteristics. For example, raingauges may provide unbiased estimates but their spatial sampling may be too poor for the proper representation of patterns. Satellite observations on the other hand are characterized by good temporal and spatial resolution but their indirect character is a cause of biases. This principle is also behind some efforts to combine microwave satellite estimates with IR based products. However, efforts to date have not resulted in a product clearly superior to single sensorbased products.\n\nAnother approach is through assimilation of satellite-based observables into a physically-based framework. An example of using satellite IR data in conjunction with surface meteorological and radar reflectivity observations within the framework of short term rainfall prediction is described by French & Krajewski (1994).\n\nFlash flood detection and runoff estimation Operationally, infrared imagery has been used in the last 15 years to detect and forecast heavy rainfall that might result in flash floods. Over the years the interactive techniques have evolved from manual to semi-automated to fully automated image analysis and rainfall estimation algorithms. Recent developments build on the improved capabilities of the new GOES-IM series. In addition to higher resolution, the water vapour channel is used to analyse the large scale conditions susceptible to heavy rain producing events. Also, since heavy rainfall is often not the only condition necessary to produce flash floods, analysis of soil moisture antecedent conditions based on passive microwave observations is incorporated. The integrated approach of using multisatellite data at a range of spatial and temporal scales for the detection and forecasting of extreme rainfall is summarized in a review by Scofield & Achutuni (1996). They also discuss future plans to combine the various GOES-IM and SSM/I derived multispectral products with the WSR-88D radar data (Klazura & Imy, 1993).\n\nExtensive effort has been expended to develop a satellite based rainfall monitoring and forecasting system for the Nile River. Accurate quantitative assessment of rainfall in the upper part of the river is essential for streamflow forecasting needed for optimal operation of the Nile reservoirs. As the region is sparsely populated and lacks a well-developed economic infrastructure, the only viable method of providing the needed rainfall estimates is from space. As accurate rainfall accumulations are necessary at scales of the order of hours to days, IR imagery is the most appropriate data source. These developments are described in Barrett (1993), Schaake & Newby (1993) and Todd et al. (1995) among others.\n\nA number of organized scientific programmes or projects are actively promoting the development, validation and/or access to the user community of satellite-derived precipitation products. The following are among the best known sources of \"standard\" satellite-derived precipitation products. For obvious reasons, programmes of this type tend to favour algorithms that are well documented and static, notwithstanding any residual uncertainties concerning their global performance in both an absolute sense and relative to newer techniques.\n\nTo meet the growing need for stably calibrated, long time series data sets for global change research, NOAA and NASA in 1990 jointly initiated the \"Early-EOS Pathfinder Data Set Activity.\" Candidate satellite data sets and algorithms were identified based on the available temporal and spatial coverage and importance of the data for global change research.\n\nAt present, the primary Pathfinder precipitation products of interest are those produced from SSM/I data using the GSCAT algorithm described earlier. These include both instantaneous full resolution rain rate and gridded global composites at coarser resolution in time and space. The data sets are available at no charge from the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, USA.\n\nThe GPCP sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is currently producing and distributing 2.5° gridded estimates of global monthly rainfall from a combination of archived microwave and infrared satellite data, surface raingauge data and numerical forecast model output. This merged product Is currently based on the Grody (SRL) microwave algorithm over land, the Arkin infrared based GPI and all available surface gauge data. First the GPI calibration (between 40° S and 40 °N) is regionally adjusted by reference to the microwave based estimates; then the multi-satellite estimates are adjusted to the gauges. This product is then combined with gauge-adjusted model output. Retrospective GPCP rainfall grids are currently available beginning in the latter half of 1987 and continuing up to approximately 1992.\n\nThe Satellite Research Laboratory has recently begun producing global monthly rainfall products based on the Grody/SRL algorithms. These are available at both 1° and 2.5° resolution from the F-8, F-ll and F-13 SSM/I. The files are now distributed through the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and may be accessed via the NCDC World Wide Web page at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov.\n\nDesigned primarily for use in conjunction with surface radar data for the operational monitoring and short term forecasting of rainfall in the midlatitudes, RAINSÀT was used in real time over eastern Canada from 1984 to 1990. The system automatically provided, among other products, a probability of precipitation (PoP) map every half hour at 8 km resolution over a 1500 km x 2000 km area. The operational performance of RAINS AT has been described by King et al. (1989). Recently, RAINSAT has been superseded by the more advanced RAINS AT II system (Bellon et al., 1992). This system has been in operational use at the Centre Météorologique de Québec, Canada, since 1991.\n\nCalibration and validation of satellite based rainfall estimation algorithms are two outstanding issues awaiting a satisfactory solution. Fundamentally, calibration entails adjusting algorithm parameters so as to optimize certain specified criteria. Typically, the objective is to minimize differences (of which there are a number of mutually contradictory measures!) between the satellite algorithm results and a reference standard. The standard can be in the form of estimates based on actual ground-based data from other sensors, remote or not, or from simulated data.\n\nValidation is understood here as the process of comparing satellite algorithm results with the results given by a reference standard sensor. Here the reference standard should be based on actual observation rather than on simulation.\n\nThe main difficulty in calibration and validation is that there are no well established standards to measure and/or estimate rainfall at the space-time scales of interest. No matter what sensor is used, estimation, defined here as transformation from the measured observables to the variable of interest, is involved. Meaningful evaluation of the performance of an algorithm can be established only if the accuracy of the reference standard is known. As pointed out by Krajewski (1993), the observed differences between satellite-based estimates and a reference estimate can be attributed to errors in both compared sensors. If the error statistics of the reference method are known, inference can be made about the error statistics of the investigated method. The errors associated with a reference method can be broadly classified as: (1) sampling;\n\n(2) measurement; and (3) estimation. For example, if raingauge data are used to estimate mean areal rainfall accumulation, each observation is corrupted with measurement error, which is a function of gauge exposure, instrument type and, mainly, the wind speed. The estimated values are subject to sampling error due to the typical sparseness of the raingauge network and to estimation error depending on the particular method used. Of the three error sources the sampling error tends to dominate. Its importance depends on the ratio of the correlation distance of rainfall accumulation at the desired temporal scale to the size of the domain over which the averaging is done.\n\nValidation using raingauges is particularly difficult at short time scales. Rainfall rate and short term rain accumulation display high degrees of zero-rain intermittence. Existing raingauge networks have average intergauge distances longer than the typical decorrelation distance of rain. As the time scale increases, the zero-rain intermittence becomes less of a problem and rainfall fields are more continuous with increasing correlation distance. For example, the correlation distance for monthly rainfall in Texas ranges from 100 km in the summer to 500 km in the winter. Clearly, rainfall estimates over areas of interest to GPCP (2.5 km x 2.5 km) can be evaluated based on rainfall from relatively few gauges, provided only that sharp gradients associated with local topographical influences are not present.\n\nEvaluation of rainfall rate estimates at high spatial resolution, for example 8 km by 8 km, made possible with IR data, is perhaps the most difficult validation problem. Most raingauges do not measure rainfall rate. Even if they could, such measurements would not be directly useful since satellite observations integrate the effects of the atmospheric column and are probably more related to rainfall accumulation extending over several minutes past the satellite observation time. Sparse raingauge networks also present difficulties in delineating rainy areas, especially given the extremely small scale variability of most rainfall. In this context radar observations of rainfall are generally more useful, though radar is itself a remote sensing technique with its own unique error sources and calibration problems.\n\nAnother approach to the validation of satellite-based rainfall estimation is indirect, through performance evaluation of systems that use rainfall as input, for example rainfall-runoff models. Although the procedure introduces new uncertainty sources, from a pragmatic point of view, it provides a \"bottom line\" measure of utility.\n\nSystematic intercomparisons of a wide variety of satellite rainfall algorithms began to be organized in the late 1980s. The First Algorithm Intercomparison Project (AIP-1), sponsored by the GPCP, focused on validating VIS, IR and SSM/I estimates over Japan and surrounding waters during June-August 1989. Results of this intercomparison have been summarized for VIS/IR techniques by Arkin & Xie (1994). Additional comments on the overall performance of both microwave and VIS/IR algorithms, as revealed in AIP-1, are offered by Petty (1995).\n\nSince then, five more major intercomparisons have followed in rapid succession, including two additional AIPs sponsored by GPCP and three Precipitation [Algorithm] Intercomparison Projects (PIPs) sponsored by the NASA WetNet project (Dodge & Goodman, 1994). Whereas the AIPs have intercompared products from VIS, IR and microwave techniques, the PIPs have emphasized the intercomparison of SSM/I algorithm products, while considering estimates from selected other sources as well. The key features and results of the six intercomparisons are summarized in Table 2 and In the following.\n\nTable 2 Recent precipitation algorithm intercomparison projects ( + indicates that the entry reflects the primary emphasis of the intercomparison, but that other secondary time periods or algorithm products were also considered) Project AIP-1 AIP-2 AIP-3 Pip-i PIP-2 PIP-3 Algos.

(1994) in progress\n\nAIP-1\n\nThe first AIP employed VIS/IR (GMS and AVHRR) and microwave (SSM/I) satellite data covering Japan and its surrounding waters during the summer of 1989. Validation data were provided by Japan's dense, well-calibrated AMeDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) surface rainfall observing network, which included automated raingauges and multiple digital weather radar sites.\n\nAltogether, some 27 algorithms were evaluated, including 17 VIS/IR algorithms and 10 SSM/I algorithms. Unfortunately, the SSM/I's 85 GHz vertically polarized channel was not usable during this period, handicapping some algorithms which normally depend on this channel. For the VIS/IR algorithms submitted to AIP-1, correlations between satellite and AMeDAS daily rainfall estimates on 1.25° squares ranged from 0.43 to 0.69 for the period 1-30 June and from 0.47 to 0.72 for the period 15 July-15 August. Many of the above algorithms exhibiting the highest correlations ( > 0.60) with the daily surface validation data nevertheless yielded large (factor of 2 or more) biases in monthly rainfall totals during one or both periods.\n\nMean absolute errors in daily VIS/IR rainfall estimates within 1.25° boxes typically ranged from approximately 4-6 mm day\" 1 during the first period; 3-4 mm day 4 during the second period. Both results are approximately equal to the respective mean observed rainfalls of 4.48 and 3.82 mm day 4 . For most of the VIS/IR algorithms, root mean squared (RMS) errors ranged from 8-9 mm day 4 for both periods.\n\nWhen statistics were computed for monthly totals, rather than daily totals, the correlations with the surface validation data improved significantly for many VIS/IR algorithms, exceeding 0.70 in many cases (0.80 for RAINSAT during the first period; 0.78 for the Australian implementation of CST during the second), but the often large biases remained.\n\nFor the five microwave algorithms that provided estimates over land and water, correlations between SSM/I and AMeDAS instantaneous rainfall estimates on 1.25° squares ranged from 0.52 to 0.73 for the 10 SSM/I swaths used in the intercomparison. Biases ranged from factor-of-two underestimates of mean rainfall to factor-of-five overestimates. For comparison, the GPI infrared method achieved a correlation of only 0.31 for the same sample.\n\nCorrelation coefficients between microwave estimates of monthly rainfall over land and the corresponding surface validation values were generally much poorer than that achieved by the IR based GPI. The poor performance is not surprising, given that the microwave estimates of monthly rainfall had to be extrapolated from a mere 4-6 SSM/I \"snapshots\" per month long period, whereas both the GPI and the surface validation estimates benefited from 1-hourly sampling throughout both periods.\n\nThe second AIP examined the performance of VIS/IR and microwave algorithms over Europe during late winter-early spring, 1991, using a combination of surface gauges and the European COST-73 radar network as validation. Overland algorithms included five geostationary IR (Meteosat) algorithms, three polar IR (AVHRR) and 12 microwave (SSM/I) algorithms. To date, the final report for AIP-2 has not yet appeared. The following summary is based on the AIP-2 Pre-Workshop Report by Allam et al. (1993).\n\nMonthly correlations at 0.5° resolution for the five Meteosat algorithms varied widely and the algorithm ranking differed dramatically according to which month was considered. For the first month, three of the algorithms achieved correlations of 0.54-0.67 vs gauges; in the second month, no algorithm achieved better than a 0.26 correlation. The best root mean square (RMS) errors with respect to gauge \"truth\" were 30 mm month\" 1 during Month 1 and 45 mm month 4 during Month 2.\n\nInterestingly, the best correlation in Month 1 was achieved by one of the simplest algorithms, the GPI of Arkin & Meisner (1987). However, this algorithm also suffered from one of the largest mean biases (112.5 mm month\" 1 ) in the same month.\n\nPeriod summary performance statistics were not produced for the ÀVHKR or SSM/I algorithms. Correlation statistics for individual overpasses were highly variable from case to case for both AVHRR and SSM/I algorithms but were frequently very low. Typical RMS errors were of the order of 1-4 mm h\" 1 . Because of the heterogeneity of the cases and the unavailability to date of appropriate pooled statistics, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions about the overall performance of any particular algorithm or class of algorithms.\n\nOne factor which undoubtedly contributed to the variable, and often low, performance statistics in this intercomparison is the intrinsic difficulty of estimating precipitation over land during the cold season. Unlike the warm months, during which relatively deep convection may be a major contributor to precipitation amounts, cold season precipitation over the continental midlatitudes often is light in intensity and possesses a stratiform character which does not present a reliable microwave or infrared signature. For microwave methods, cold surface temperatures and the possible presence of surface snow cover are additional complicating factors.\n\nThis intercomparison focused on a small region of the western equatorial Pacific for which ship-board radar data were available (Ebert & Manton, 1995). Because the validation region was located entirely over water, results for the SSM/I algorithms cannot be used to draw conclusions about overland performance of microwave algorithms. However, it was noted that the SSM/I algorithms generally performed substantially better than VIS/IR algorithms at retrieving instantaneous rain rates at 0.5° spatial resolution, with correlation coefficients as high as 0.72-0.76 for a number of SSM/I algorithms, as compared with maximum correlations between 0.50 and 0.56 for the better IR algorithms. For monthly rainfall totals over the same area and with the same spatial averaging, correlation coefficients improved to approximately 0.85-0.88 for both VIS/IR and MW algorithms, with a few IR methods and one mixed IR/MW method barely edging out the best MW-only algorithms.\n\nThis intercomparison was the first to attempt a global, rather than regional, validation of multiple satellite rainfall algorithms. Unlike the AIPs, PIP-1 was designed primarily for intercomparison of SSM/I algorithms, though the infrared based GPI product (Arkin & Meisner, 1987), a mixed IR/microwave algorithm, and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model-derived rainfall analyses were also included. The principal validation data set over land consisted of monthly gauge totals from around the world, archived by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) in Offenbach, Germany.\n\nA special issue of Remote Sensing Reviews is devoted to PIP-1 implementation and results and the reader is referred to this volume for further details (Barrett, 1994;Barrett et al., 1994a,b). To summarize, the majority of SSM/I algorithms yielded correlations of -0.7-0.8 with respect to monthly totals within 2.5° boxes between 40°N and 40°S, for those boxes containing at least two GPCC gauges. The GPI was also a top performer in general and in fact yielded the top correlations in the latitude bands between 40°S and 20°N.\n\nThe best RMS differences were close to -70 mm month\" 1 for several products, including, interestingly, the ECMWF model-predicted rainfall product. It was also noted, however, that the relative ranking of competing algorithms was a function of geographical region -some algorithms which performed respectably in the tropics performed less impressively in the middle and high latitudes.\n\nIn the second PIP, 25 SSM/I rain rate algorithms were applied to a set of 123 SSM/I overpasses, each of which had been contributed by one of the PIP-2 participants. These overpasses represented every major climatic zone and precipitation type and covered both land and ocean. A unique feature of PIP-2 is that the validation data were also contributed by the participants for their own selected cases and consisted variously of radar data, gauge data and aircraft data. The validation data quality was highly variable, both with respect to discrimination of rain/no-rain and with respect to absolute magnitudes. Pooled performance statistics for the various algorithms are therefore difficult to interpret.\n\nPIP-2 did reveal, however, that most SSM/I algorithms differ in significant ways from one another with respect to both ability to detect Tain areas and intensities of rainfall. Some algorithms clearly yielded widespread spurious rainfall under some conditions, while others identified only the most intense rainfall. As expected, light stratiform precipitation proved particularly difficult to discriminate reliably, as did precipitation over mountainous or otherwise inhomogeneous terrain. Detailed summaries of PIP-2 results are scheduled to be published in a special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric Science in the course of 1996.\n\nCurrently, PIP-3 is in the planning stages and will be undertaken in 1996. It is currently envisaged as a global intercomparfson similar to PIP-1, but covering the full calendar year of 1992 and focusing especially on the validation of the latest versions of routinely generated rainfall products now available through the GPCP and other sources.\n\nThe validation results to date suggest that current satellite VIS/IR rainfall estimation schemes are most likely to be useful for estimating climatic scale (e.g. weekly or monthly average, 2-5° resolution) distributions of principally connective rainfall, as is found in the tropics and subtropics and during the warm season over midlatitude continental interiors. On these spatial and temporal scales, correlations of 0.8 or greater can apparently be achieved with IR methods, though there remains the problem of significant regional and seasonal biases. Current microwave algorithms, on the other hand, appear to be capable of achieving overland correlations of 0.7 or better for instantaneous rain rates averaged over 0.5-1.0° boxes. However, when the objective is to produce time-averaged rainfall at a location, the infrequent sampling by polar orbiters seems to eliminate the advantage microwave methods have over IR methods, particularly over short time periods ( -days or less). For this reason, infrared observations continue to be more useful for operational hydrology.\n\nRegardless of the algorithm or spectral band utilized, warm cloud rainfall over land is unlikely to give rise to a signal that can be reliably detected by any current passive microwave technique. Unfortunately, there are regions for which warm cloud rainfall probably makes a very important contribution to the total seasonal rainfall, especially where orographic (upslope) rainfall is favoured.\n\nRMS errors in rain rates derived by any method are functions of both correlation and bias; the latter, however, cannot be evaluated with confidence unless the validation data set is itself known to be very well calibrated in an absolute sense. Surprisingly often, this is not the case, especially for radar derived rain rates. Surface gauges generally suffer from less pronounced calibration problems, but incompatibility with respect to space-time sampling makes them less than ideal as tools for validating satellite algorithms.\n\nValidation remains an outstanding problem. Fortunately, it is expected that the next decade of research will improve considerably our understanding of the performance of satellite-based rainfall estimation algorithms. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite will be launched in 1997 (Simpson et ai., 1988). This will carry several sensors, including microwave and infrared radiometers and, for the first time, an active radar. The availability of space-based radar data in particular will be invaluable both for reliably detecting rainfall in otherwise ambiguous cases and for improving the global calibration of passive IR and microwave methods, which will continue to be a primary source of rainfall information over regions not directly sampled by the TRMM radar.\n\nGround validation of the space-based estimates is also an important element of the TRMM mission. Several validation sites have been established over both land and oceans. Weather radars and dense raingauge networks will be used in conjunction with other observations to characterize the uncertainty associated with the satellite rainfall estimates.\n\nAnother opportunity is that created by the soon to be completed implementation of NEXRAD, a system of Doppler radars (WSR-88D) used by the US National Weather Service for weather forecasting. Precipitation products from these radars will provide virtually complete coverage of the United States with a resolution of 4 km and time scale of one hour and above. These should prove very useful for the validation of satellite methods once the initial radar calibration problems are solved. Similar development of radar networks is taking place in Europe.\n\nFor hydrological applications involving individual river basins, it is clear that the preferred approach is to use a combination of locally optimized satellite algorithms and any available raingauge data for rainfall information, with observed river runoff information serving as validation/calibration data for the combined satellite algorithm and hydrological model.\n\nFinally, the reader is reminded that this paper has focused entirely on the detection and estimation by satellites of rainfall in progress. For some applications, satellite techniques for estimating antecedent precipitation, snow cover and surface wetness may often be of comparable or even greater importance. These techniques are quite distinct from those described above and are discussed elsewhere in this publication."
