    "abstract": "The persistent occurrcucc of sl-sternatic errors of harotropic forecasts over mountainous areas is strongly suggestive of significant effect,s of mountains and frictioll which have not been included in the previously used forecast models. This st,udy reports 011 experiments with a I I ~J V barotropic forecast model which contains an improved mountain effect and a surface friction cffect.\nFor computation of the surface stress depending on the wind and on the terrain, a hemispheric map of the drag coefficient is obtained.\nThe results of tests of the forecast rnodcl on a n init,ially zonal flow-, anti on ten observed meteorological situations, indicate that the effects of terrain on the cvolnlion of atmospheric flow patterns can be of large magnitude, and can account for significant errors in numerical prediction. Some s1Iccrss at accounting for these effects is attained with the barotropic representation of the atmosphere.

    "full_text": "In cousidering the errors of d:tily h r o t r o p i c forecasts, one is impressed witlr the high l r e q u m c ~of o c c t ~r r ~~~c ( ~ of certain clrnracterist'ic errors. Somtl of t t w most pronounced of these appear wit8h regul:wit>on mot~thl>means of the bnrotropic errors. One well-known type is associated with Irequent cTTclogerlesis dong the east coasts of Asia and S o r t h America, and appc:m ns :I positive mean algebraic error over these areas during ttrc winter season. Efforts are under way in many rcsctwcll centers to improve our ability to lorecast cyclogenesis.\n\nAnother frequent'ly observed error is lountl over mest'crn North America, and consists of a telrdency to forecast too strong winds in t'he jet' stream as well as a tcrldcnc3to forecast. too low heights of the pressure surfaces. Although it is not, clear a priori that' these errors itre directly topographically induced, since :I rnount'ain effect' is included in the barotropic forecasts (Chssman [4]), the high dependability of these errors has let1 us to a reexamination of t8he orograptric influences in t h e f'ramcworl~ of t,he bizrotropic forecasts.\n\nFigure 1 is a characteristic monthly error chart showing these errors. The negative error appearing over northwestern Canada and southeastern Alaska appears 011 practically every monthly error chart, its strerrgt'h npparently depending on the speed of t h e westerlies.\n\nThe customary method of including mountain effects in numerical predict,ion consists of imagining that the atmosphere ext,ends everywhere to 1000 mb., but that n vertical motion is induced at, t h e lower hound tar^accord-569382-60\"-5 irrg to the do\\\\-of t'tw fictitious 1000-mb. wind up or down the slope of t l l r actual terrain, i.e.\n\na\"= Vo . vp, (1) wtrerc w,, is d p ; d a t the lower boundary, Vo is the 1000-mb. wintl, a n t 1 p , is the standard pressure at, the surface of the ground. The version of this mountnit1 effect used a t the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction (JSITP) Unit furt'her supposes that the vert,icd velocitJ-imposed by this effect, falls off from w0 at p , (1000 mh.) to zero at the pressure p=O, giving a 500-mh. vorticitJ-tendency due to t'he mountain effect, (d<k3t)rn, of where p , represents the pressure at a mean tropopause, i.e., 200 mb., and V,< represents the wind a t ground level. This is obtained by supposing t'tmt V,=V/5, and using the interpolation formula v,=v [\" if p , is expressed in millibars.\n\nIn making calculations with t'his mountain effect, the values of pg used mere t,aken from the paper bJ-Bwkofsk?and Bertoni [3J.\n\nThe components of the surface stress ( r 2 , T , ) arc related to the ageostrophic mass transport ( M 2 , AI,) by the relations, as given by Holmboe, Forsythe, and Gustin [ 7 ] , Tor example,\n\nIf we solve for t'he mass divergence in the friction luycr and introduce the equation of continuity we obtain the wellknown expression for vertical velocity wH (actually (dp/dt) a t t'he top of t'he friction layer, Various opinions have been presented regarding the lllost suit'nble expression for the surface stress as a functjoli of the surfnc,c geostrophic wind speed. Alintz [la] favors :l linear relationship, whereas the data presented by Taylor [22] and by Lettau [SI suggest that the surface stress is 111ore nearly proport'ional to t'he square of the wind speed, according to the expression\n\nwhcrc p is t'hc tlcnsity a ~l d Cd is the skin drag cocmcient.\n\nITe will u~ldrrst:~nd V, 21s the wind :tt top of the friction layc~, or the geostrophic surf:tce wind.\n\nLet't'au [lo] has present'ed a rcrnarkable analogy between flow in conduits and flow in the atmospheric boundary laJ-cr, supporting the use of equation ( 7) , a t least for largcscale flow. 111 view of the fact that Cd varies nlarlredly with cllaugcs it1 the static stability, equatian (7) and cven the concept oT ,drag coefficient, might not bc espccially useful for small-scale studies or for lorecusts of short time range; c.g., 12 hours. However, since burotropic forecasting is concerncd with large-scale atmospheric motiorls esterding over periods of several days, the relation described b ~7 ecluat'ion (7) was selected for use in this study.\n\nIn order to incorporate friction int'o the forecast in any scale of notion snluller than the zonal vortex itself, it is necessary to have a map of the distribution of the drag coefficient over the lorecast area, in this case the Northern Hemisphere. Although maps of this type do not appear in the literature', a large number of bot'll empirical and theoretical determirlat~ions of surface stress and drag coefficient have been made by various investigators. A number of t'hese will be considered below.\n\nI n t h e discussion of numerical values we shall try to discrinlinate between the drag over flat land or over ocean and the Iorrn drag of the large-scale relief of the earth's surface. For this purpose we can consider that the drag coefficient C, is made up of two partial drag coefficients, C, and C,, where C 2 will he used to give the form drag of t'he relief, and CI is relatively constant.\n\nSawyer [14], following a11 earlier treatmcmt by Scorer\n\n[Is], has computed the drag of a rnountain ridge by considering t'he net downmard transport of momentum by the gravit>y oscillations set up in the flow over the ridge. His equation for drag is well suited for colnput'ation of numerical values of C2. For example, with ridges 300 m. high spnccd a t 10-km. intervals, C2=0.15;< IO-'. This might, correspond to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. Extending the same treatment to ex-tre~nely rough mountains, 3 km. high, spaced 80 km. apart, we find C2=O.85X10-'. This could correspond to the roughest places in the Rocky AIountains or to some areas of Tibet. l.lxlo-~ 1.1x10-3 0.2XIO-3 Arctic icc. Lripzig. O'Scill, S e l r . Collrpc Station, Ten.

However, one should be careful not t,o estc.tltl this conclusion for applicatioll to more comp1ic:Ltctl models than the barot'ropic.\n\nI n ordcr to obtain an idea of' the magnitutlr~s ol' tltc mountain and friction effects, a series of htwotropic forecasts was made in which the initial data corrsistcd ol' a set of circular stream lines a t 500 r n b . coincident with this forecast was 20 feet), indicating that the cl~angos introduced into subsequent forecasts by mountain and friction effects were real.\n\nNext, a 48-hr. forecast was macle in which the eflect' of mountains, (b</bt),, was included, but in which the effect of friction was excluded. The disturbances which developed on the initially zonal flow are shown in figure 4. Examination of this figure reveals t'hat the eflect of the mountain terms is to turn the flow to the right, with the downwind fall centers having about twice the amplitude of the upwind rise centers.\n\nT h e result of nlaking tl 48-hr. forecast in which the lIlount,ain term was escl~lded and t'he friction term in-c~luclccl is shown in figure 5 . The chief impression obtained fro111 this figure is that' of a ret,ardat.ion of t h e zollal flow over the roughest arens of figure 2 . Gencrall?speaking, there appears to be a diversion of the P,ow around the roughcst areas.\n\nFigure 6 shows the result of including both mountain and friction terms in the lorecast. I n this map the la11 cast, of the Asian Plateau is considerably smaller t h n shown in figure 4. T l ~c formation of a jet st'ream flowing fromrtlle southwest over sout~heastern Asia and Japm 1))-48 hr. (prtrt,icularly if one adds rnentnlly the initid zo11a1 flow) is suggcstivc of the wvell known jet strc:un o1)scrvctl to form in that region. Also, t h e ridgy. appearing o ~r r the Rocky Mount'ains with thc flow from the rlortll 011 the east side of the nlountains resen~b1r.s the pc~rtnrbations on tho normal charts. In order to see some of the results in greater detail, let us consider two exnrnp!es. In one ol these, t,l~e Rocky hlount~aio area was domin:itetl by : L ridge. In the ot'ller, it was dominated by a trough. Furthermore, the height verifications (table 2) showed an irllprovernent in one cme and a deterioration in the other as result of the inclusion of' terrain effects.\n\nThe first of these, April 2-4, 1960, figures 7 and 8, shows the intensificnt'ion of a 500-mb. ridge over the Rocky Mountains. The errors ol the 48-hr. forecast made with-out terrain effects, figure 9, are unusually large for barotropic forecasts a t this t.ime of the year, indicating that pr:tctic:tlly none of the ridge development was forecast. The added forecast' clmlge from the t'errain effects, figure 10, shows the rcduction of error in the mountainous area ol' westcrn C:m;td:t by about 25 percent of the total error. In investigating this case lurthcr, it was discovered that the surface w i d approximation used in the model gave B surface (gradicnt' level) wind of only half the observed v:~lue a t tllc initial tir~le. Il the surface wind approxima- Mountain area was dominated by cyclonic flow. 'I'he Low in the western States at t,he initial time (fig. 1 1) moved slowly northeastward with filling (fig. 12). The failure of the forecast without t'crrain effect's to forecast the filling is shown by t'he error chart of figure 13. The contribution of mountains and friction, shown in figure 14, produced a height change in the forecast very nearly equal and opposite to the large error appearing in figure 13.\n\nThe fact that the root-mean-square height error of the forecast was slightly increased by the inclusion of the terrain effects runs cont'rary to expectations from looking a t t'he maps, and reflects the treacherous nature of uninterpreted root-mean-square errors. Despite the verification, one obteins an impression of a substantial improvement' gained by incorporating the terrain effects.\n\nFrom the above study we conclude that combined mountain and friction effects in the atmosphere are responsible for large and recurrent forecast errors. The action of terrain 011 the atmosphere is probably of equal importance with cyclogenesis in producing errors in the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS current barotropic forecast model. The principal barrier t.o removing a large part of these errors is the lack of an accurate surface wind.\n\nThe inclusion of mountain and surface friction in more advanced forecast models appears to be absolutely necessary. If this is not done, serious forecast) errors will exist through a deep layer of the atmosphere.\n\n1. V. L.
