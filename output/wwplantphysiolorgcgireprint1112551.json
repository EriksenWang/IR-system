    "full_text": "the presence of a phosphorylation motif equivalent to that found in other plant PEPCs studied so far. The binding of this APS-lgC to the target protein promoted changes in the properties of seed PEPC similar to those produced by phosphorylation, as previously shown for the recombinant Sorghum leaf C, PEPC. In desalted seed extracts, an endogenous PEPC kinase activity catalyzed a bona fide phosphorylation of the target protein, as deduced from the immunoinhibition of the in vitro phosphorylation reaction by the APS-IgC. In addition, the major, 103-kD PEPC polypeptide was also shown to be radiolabeled in situ 48 h after imbibition in [32Plorthophosphate. The ratio between optimal (pH 8) and suboptimal (pH 7.3 or 7.1) PEPC activity decreased during germination, thereby suggesting a change in catalytic rate related to an in vivo phosphorylation process. These collective data document that the components needed for the regulatory phosphorylation of PEPC are present and functional during germination of wheat seeds. ~~ PEPC (EC 4.1.1.31) is widely distributed in plants. A small multigene family encodes different forms of the enzyme that are involved in specific physiological functions (Lepiniec et al., 1994). A number of studies devoted to the photosynthetic PEPC from C, and CAM plants have shown that the enzyme is tightly regulated by light at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels (Andreo et al., 1987;Leegood and Osmond, 1990;Jiao and Chollet, 1991;Jiao et al., 1991;Huber et al., 1992;Nimmo, 1993;Gupta et al., 1994;Lepiniec et al., 1994;Rajagopalan et al., 1994). In contrast, little is known about the regulation of the non-This research was supported by grant no. PB 92-0675 from DirecciÓn General de Investigación Científica y Técnica and by the Grupo de Investigación de Fisiologia Vegetal from La Junta de Andalucia.\n\nphotosynthetic PEPC isoforms. It has been shown that they are subject to allosteric control (Andreo et al., 1987), but there is little experimental evidence to illustrate the in vivo posttranslational regulation, the signal transduction pathway, and the nature of the stimulus operating on the covalent modification of these nonphotosynthetic isoforms. The nonphotosynthetic PEPCs were shown to be in vivo phosphorylated in illuminated, N-recovering wheat (Trificum aestivum) leaves (Van Quy et al., 1991; Van Quy and  Champigny, 1992; Duff and Chollet, 1995), in soybean nodules (Zhang et al., 1995), and in stomatal guard cells (Schnabl et al., 1992;Zhang et al., 1994). Changes in the properties of an in vitro phosphorylated enzyme were established only for the recombinant C,-type Sorghum PEPC (Pacquit et al., 1993) and the soybean nodule enzyme (Schuller and Dietrich, 1993). PEPC kinase activity that phosphorylated the C,-type PEPC was shown to be present in extracts of the corresponding organs as well as in Sorgkum roots (Pacquit et al., 1993), and the identification of the phosphorylated amino acid as a Ser was illustrated by Zhang et al. (1995) for the in vivo-phosphorylated nodule PEPC.\n\nA few reports have dealt with PEPC during grain maturation and germination (Blanke and Lenz, 1989). Both PEPC mRNA and enzyme activity were found in dry seeds of Sorghum (Khayat et al., 1991), and a newly synthesized form was immunologically characterized during imbibition by castor oil seeds (Sangwan et al., 1992;Podestá andPlaxton, 1994a, 1994b). In the endosperm of developing castor oil seeds, a single, 100-kD PEPC subunit cross-reacted with anti-PEPC antibodies, whereas both 103-and 108-kD forms were detected in the early days of the germinating endosperm (Sangwan et al., 1992). Castor oil seed PEPC could have a critica1 function in providing malate for fatty acid biosynthesis during seed development (Sangwan et al., 1992) and in fueling the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle during germination (Podestá andPlaxton, 1994a, 1994b). A PEPC form was also identified in Plant Physiol. Vol. 11 1, 1996 barley grains. This PEPC activity increased in parallel to that of alcohol dehydrogenase, presumably for the development of a malate/ethanol fermentation in the aleurone cell layer during maturation (Macnicol and Jacobsen, 1992). However, in none of these studies was the posttranslational regulation of seed PEPC examined. AI1 plant PEPCs sequenced so far, including C,, CAM, and C, species, have an N-terminal phosphorylation domain (Sugimoto et al., 1992;Vazquez-Tello et al., 1993;Lepiniec et al., 1994). The phosphorylation of a regulatory Ser in this domain impacts on the regulation of the enzyme by pH (Echevarría et al., 1994) and by opposing allosteric effectors, i.e. a decrease in sensitivity to L-malate, an end-product inhibitor (Nimmo et al., 1987), and in the K, for the activator Glc-6-P (Duff et al., 1995). In the present work, the possibility that seed PEPC is regulated by phosphorylation was assessed by the use of an APS-IgG. We show that the components needed for the covalent regulation of PEPC are present in wheat seeds and that phosphorylation occurs in vivo during germination.\n\nWheat (Tritictlm aestivum cv Chinese Spring from Pioneer, Seville, Spain) seeds were sterilized in 2% (v/v) NaOCl for 20 to 30 min and washed with sterile water, 0.01 M HCI, and, finally, sterile water. Whole seeds were placed on filter papers soaked with sterile water in a glass Petri dish. Seeds were allowed to imbibe for the needed time at room temperature. The synthetic peptide ERHHSIDAQL-RALAPGKVSEE(YG), where the boldface S is the regulatory Ser and parenthetical YG are added amino acids not present in PEPC, APS-IgGs, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against native Sorghum C, PEPC were prepared as described by Pacquit et al. (1995) andVida1 et al. (1981).\n\n[y-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) and 32Pi (200 Ci/mol) were from Amersham. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Pharmacia. AI1 other reagents were from Sigma.\n\nFor most experiments, dry seeds or those that had imbibed or were separated from the embryo by use of a razor blade and the aleurone-endosperm were analyzed. At different stages of imbibition, the material was chopped and ground thoroughly at 4°C in a chilled mortar with washed sand in a volume (10 seeds/mL) of buffer A containing 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl,, 10 pg/mL chymostatin, 10 pg/mL bestatin, 10 pg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 pg/mL microcystin-LR, where LR are the two variable amino acids in the structure of microcystin and 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 min in a microfuge, and the supernatant fluid was used as a crude extract or rapidly filtered through Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A lacking SH reagent) and used as a desalted, crude extract. A11 buffers were used at 4°C.\n\nCrude extracts from seeds (aleurone-endosperm) were obtained as described above and subjected to 10 or 8% SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) for 14 h at 85 V and room temperature in a Bio-Rad electrophoresis cell. Proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (N-8017 from Sigma) at 10 V (3 mA/cm2) for 75 min in a Bio-Rad Semidry Transfer blot apparatus. The membrane was blocked by a 4-h incubation in TBS (20 mM Tris-HC1,0.15 M NaCI, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk, and then protein bands were immunochemically labeled by an overnight incubation of the membrane at room temperature in 20 mL of TBS containing either purified polyclonal C, PEPC IgG (300 pg of protein) or APS-IgG (20 pg of protein). Subsequent detection was by a peroxidase assay (affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Bio-Rad).\n\nFor most experiments, an aliquot of the desalted crude extract from dry seeds in buffer B was incubated (0.05 unit PEPC/60 pL) at 30°C with 0.25 mM AP,A (to inhibit endogenous adenylate kinase activity), a phosphocreatine (4 mM)-creatine phosphokinase (10 units) ADP-scavenging system, and 25 nM [y-32P]ATP (1 pCi) in a final volume of 100 pL (Echevarría et al., 1990). After 30 min, the assays were stopped by boiling the samples for 2 min at 90°C in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue (sample buffer) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Echevarría et al., 1990). The effect of APS-IgGs on the in vitro phosphorylation of PEPC was checked following a 30-min preincubation (OOC) of a saturating amount (20 pg) of the APS-IgG with the desalted crude extract before [y-32P]ATP addition.\n\nEight deembryonated half seeds were allowed to imbibe in 200 pL of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5,lO mM CaC1, (Hamabata et al., 1988;Heimovaara-Dijkstra et al., 1994), and 200 pCi of 32Pi. After 48 h of imbibition at room temperature, about half of the solution was absorbed by the seeds. The seeds were washed to remove nonabsorbed and proteins were extracted as described above in buffer A containing 1 mM nonradioactive ATP to minimize in vitro phosphorylation. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. The clarified sample containing 0.16 unit of PEPC activity was incubated with the appropriate amount of purified polyclonal C, PEPC IgG (134 pg of protein) for 45 min on ice. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the incubated sample to 4% (w/v) and vortexed briefly with a 5-min interval (Zhang et al., 1995). The beaded immunocomplexes were sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, washed three times with buffer containing 500 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8, 1.5 M NaC1, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and two times with 100 mM Tris-HC1 alone. The pellet was resus-pended in SDS sample buffer, heated for 10 min at 90°C / and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at room temperature, and the supernatant fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide). Proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose and autoradiographed (15 d at -80°C), and seed PEPC was immunocharacterized as described above.\n\nA B 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 PEPC 108 kD 103 kD 100 kD\n\nPEPC activity at 30°C was recorded spectrophotometrically at the optimal and suboptimal pH values of 8 and 7.3 or 7.1, respectively, using the NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (at 2.5 ITIM PEP) described by Echevarria et al. (1994). Assays were initiated by addition of the desalted or nondesalted crude seed extract. Malate sensitivity (IC 50 ) was determined as described by Echevarria et al. (1994). An enzyme unit is defined as the amount of PEPC that catalyzes the carboxylation of 1 /j-mol PEP min\" 1 at pH 8, 30°C. In the APS-IgG binding assay, crude extracts were incubated with different amounts of APS-IgG or APS-IgG plus the synthetic peptide (100 nmol) for 15 min at 0°C to avoid proteolysis, then activity was recorded at pH 7.1. Protein was assayed by a sensitive dye-binding method (Bradford, 1976) using BSA as standard.\n\nSoluble protein extracts were rapidly prepared from dry seeds and at different stages after imbibition. PEPC activity was determined in crude extracts from the aleurone-en- PEPC Fragments Figure 2. Immunocharacterization of wheat seed PEPC and its phosphorylation domain during germination. Soluble proteins from aleurone-endosperm crude extracts (50 /jl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide), transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with either specific, polyclonal C 4 PEPC IgGs (300 jug protein/20 ml incubation medium) (A) or APS-lgGs (20 /xg protein/20 ml incubation medium) (B). Immunolabeled proteins were detected by a peroxidase assay. Lanes 1, Dry seed; lanes 2 to 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after imbibition, respectively.\n\ndosperm. Figure 1 shows that the total PEPC activity (units/seed) increased about 17% relative to the initial activity in dry seeds and then slightly decreased, whereas the total amount of soluble protein (mg protein seed^1 X 10\" : ) continuously decreased from the first hours of imbibition. This gave rise to a significant increase (50%) in specific activity of PEPC and indicated the stability of the enzyme during the germinative and postgerminative periods.\n\nProteins at the same stages of germination were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot experiments. Specific anti-Sorghum C 4 PEPC polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with 103-and 100-kD bands present in dry seeds and those that had imbibed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4), and a new 108-kD band was detected after 6 h of imbibition (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4). In another set of experiments, APS-lgGs were used instead of the polyclonal anti-PEPC IgGs (Pacquit et al., 1995). These anti-phosphorylation-site IgGs were shown to cross-react equally well with both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the enzyme. Once again, these antibodies detected the 103-and 100-kD PEPC bands present in all samples (Fig. 2B, lanes 1^1) and the new 108-kD band throughout imbibition (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). This report documents that the wheat seed PEPC forms possess the consensus phosphorylation domain common to all plant PEPCs known so far (Sugimoto et al., 1992;Vazquez-Tello et al., 1993;Lepiniec et al., 1994). Despite the fact that a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors was included in the extraction buffer, proteolytic fragments were sometimes revealed by the specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A).\n\nThe APS-IgG not only recognized the consensus phosphorylation domain (Fig. 2B) but also promoted changes in PEPC properties, similar to those found for the recombinant Sorghum leaf C 4 PEPC, that mimic phosphorylation (Pacquit et al., 1995). Figure 3 shows that preincubation of crude seed extracts with saturating amounts of APS-lgGs A control was performed in the presence of equivalent amounts of IgG from a preimmune serum (•). After a 15-min preincubation, PEPC activity was recorded at suboptimal conditions of pH (7.1) and [PEP] (2.5 mM). The 100% value refers to the activity (50 ^L) of the control sample (5 nmol/min at pH 7.1 and 2.5 mM PEP). The IC 50 value for L-malate (in parentheses) was determined at pH 7.3 and 2.5 mM PEP and estimated from a plot of PEPC activity versus L-malate concentration. Data are from a representative experiment.\n\nwhether they can be phosphorylated in vitro in desalted, crude extracts of dry seeds. The autoradiographic pattern displayed in Figure 4A, lane Ib, revealed the presence of various soluble proteins incorporating 32 P during incubation in the presence of [y-32 P]ATP. APS-lgGs were used to indicate whether there was a phosphorylated PEPC among these radiolabeled polypeptides. The rationale of this experiment relied on the ability of these antibodies to specifically block PEPC phosphorylation by PEPC kinase(s) upon binding to the target protein, as previously shown in the case of C 4 PEPC from Sorghum (Pacquit et al., 1995). Addition of the APS-lgGs (20 /xg) to the in vitro phosphorylation assay severely and specifically impaired the phosphorylation of a major, 103-kD polypeptide and of two minor, 100and 108-kD polypeptides, thereby showing that these polypeptides are subunits of the genuine, in vitro phosphorylatable seed PEPCs (Fig. 4A, lane 2b). The endogenous PEPCs were barely stained by Coomassie blue (Fig. 4A, lanes la and 2a). Thus, an aliquot from the phosphorylated sample in Figure 4A, lane 1, was electroblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with polyclonal C 4 PEPC antibodies (Fig. 4B, lane la). The corresponding autoradiograph (Fig. 4B, lane Ib) showed that the phosphorylated 103-kD polypeptide, whose phosphorylation was impaired by the APS-lgGs (Fig. 4A, lane 2b), co-migrated with the corresponding antibody-decorated endogenous seed PEPC (Fig. 4B, lanes la and Ib). It was also examined whether seed PEPC kinase(s) can phosphorylate an immunoaffinity-purified Sorghum leaf C 4 PEPC produced as a recombinant (Pacquit et al., 1993), dephosphorylated protein in Escherichia coli (Fig. 4A, lanes 3a and 3b). The addition of 2 mM caused an enhancement of PEPC activity at pH 7.1 (about 3.5 times) and an increase in the IC 50 for L-malate (from 0.1-0.5 mM [parentheses in Fig. 3]) measured at suboptimal pH (7.3) and [PEP] 2.5 mM, whereas the preimmune serum had no effect. This finding was due to the APS-lgGs specifically binding to the N-terminal phosphorylation site of the protein, since the addition of 100 nmol of free peptide (see \"Materials\") to the preincubation medium nullified the APS-IgG-induced increase in PEPC activity (Fig. 3). Therefore, these results extend the modulation effect of the APS-IgG, previously shown for the recombinant Sorghum leaf C 4 PEPC (Pacquit et al., 1995), to the nonphotosynthetic isoforms from wheat seeds. The use of APS-lgGs with these crude extracts also provided a rapid and easy means to verify the enzyme's integrity with respect to the N-terminal phosphorylation domain and to argue that the N terminus of wheat seed PEPC is involved in the modification of its regulatory properties and catalytic activity, as described for other plant PEPCs (Echevarria et al., 1994;Lepiniec et al., 1994;Pacquit et al., 1995).\n\nThe immunological demonstration that wheat seed PEPCs (aleurone-endosperm) possess the consensus phosphorylation domain (Fig. 2B) prompted us to investigate\n\nA B MW la 2a 3a Ib 2b 3b la Ib = PEPC EPC ragments -PEPC = Fra 133 -85 -47 - Figure 4. Immunocharacterization of the in vitro phosphorylated seed PEPC and its phosphorylation site using APS-IgG. Rapidly desalted crude extracts of dry seeds (0.05 unit of PEPC/60 /A!_ in buffer B) were preincubated for 30 min at 0°C with either 20 /ig of IgG from a preimmune serum (lanes 1), 20 /ng of APS-IgG (lanes 2), or preimmune serum and 0.2 unit of purified, nonphosphorylated C 4 PEPC (recombinant) from Sorghum (lanes 3) (A). The samples (in buffer B) were then supplemented with 1 /xCi of [y-32 P]ATP, an ADP-scavenging system, and an adenylate kinase inhibitor (see \"Materials and Methods\"). The phosphorylation reactions were conducted for 30 min at 30°C and terminated with 20 /ML. of SDS sample buffer. After heat denaturation, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide).

In situ phosphorylation of PEPC in germinating wheat seeds. Eight deembryonated half seeds were allowed to imbibe with 200 /nCi of 32 Pi at room temperature. After 48 h of imbibition, proteins from the aleurone-endosperm tissue were extracted in buffer A containing 1 mM nonradioactive ATP, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal C 4 PEPC IgC (134 /n,g of protein), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide). The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, autoradiographed (15 d at -80°C), and probed with 300 jug of polyclonal C 4 PEPC antibodies. Shown are the immunoblot from an aleurone-endosperm immunoprecipitated sample (a) and the corresponding autoradiograph (b).\n\nEGTA to the in vitro assay resulted in a 30% reduction of radiolabeling of the PEPC polypeptide (data not shown). These collective data support the view that wheat seed PEPCs contain the consensus phosphorylation site (acidicbasic-X-X-Ser-IDAQLR) homologous to that described in other plant PEPCs (Sugimoto et al., 1992;Vazquez-Tello et al., 1993;Lepiniec et al., 1994), with the Ser likely being the regulatory, phosphorylated amino acid. As a corollary, the results also indicate that seeds contain endogenous protein kinase activities that perform a bona fide phosphorylation of the target PEPC in vitro.\n\nThe above results supported the view that the 103-kD PEPC polypeptide was phosphorylated by endogenous PEPC kinase(s) in the seed during germination, but how this impacted on the functional properties of the enzyme needed to be clarified. A classical test to estimate the extent of in vivo phosphorylation of PEPC is the determination of its malate sensitivity (Nimmo et al., 1987;Jiao and Chollet, 1988;Bakrim et al., 1993). The IC SO for L-malate of PEPC from dry wheat seeds was 0.1 ± 0.03 mM, at a pH of 7.3 and PEP concentration of 2.5 mM, and inhibition by this compound was antagonized by Glc-6-P (data not shown). However, the malate test has a limited sensitivity, in particular when the changes in phosphorylation state are relatively low.\n\nIn this work, we used another test to monitor the apparent in vivo phosphorylation state of PEPC based on the ratio between optimal (pH 8) and suboptimal (pH 7.3 or 7.1) PEPC activity. We first determined that pH 8 and pH 7.3 or 7.1, at [PEP] of 2.5 mM, are, respectively, optimal and suboptimal assay conditions for seed PEPC activity in crude extracts (data not shown). In the case of the C 4 PEPC from Sorghum, this ratio was previously shown to decrease with increasing phosphorylation due to the fact that there was an enhancement of catalytic rate at suboptimal pH values (7.1 or 7.3) (Echevarria et al., 1994). Compared to the malate-sensitivity test, the \"velocity test\" is more sensitive and rapid, allowing one to minimize any experimental artifact due to proteolysis or dephosphorylation of the enzyme in crude extracts.\n\nRapidly desalted crude extracts were prepared at different stages of germination and used to measure PEPC activity at pH 8, 7.3, and 7.1. The data in Figure 6 indicate that\n\nFollowing the findings that the seed PEPCs could be phosphorylated in vitro at the phosphorylation domain (Fig. 4) and the related changes in enzyme properties observed upon binding APS-IgGs (Fig. 3), we investigated whether phosphorylation of the seed PEPC subunits also occurred in situ. To this end, eight deembryonated half seeds were allowed to imbibe 200 ;uCi 200 pL\" 1 buffered 32 Pi. After 48 h of imbibition, proteins from the aleuroneendosperm tissue were extracted, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal C 4 PEPC IgG, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide). The immunoprecipitated proteins resolved in the gel were electroblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with polyclonal C 4 PEPC antibodies (Fig. 5, lane a). The corresponding autoradiograph showed the in situ, 32 Pphosphorylated, 103-kD PEPC, whereas the minor, 100and 108-kD polypeptides were not detected (Fig. 5, lane b). The 100-kD PEPC could be a proteolytic product of the major, 103-kD subunit produced during immunoprecipitation (45 min on ice) of the protein. Altogether, the data document that the components needed for the regulatory phosphorylation of aleurone-endosperm PEPC are present and functional in germinating wheat seeds. Plant Physiol. Vol. 1 1 1 , 1996 the pH 8:pH 7.3 PEPC activity ratio decreases about 27% from the initial value (2.6-1.9) after 4 d of germination. This decrease was consistently higher, close to 38% (5.3-3.3), when the pH 8:pH 7.1 activity ratio was determined. These results indicate that changes in PEPC properties during the germinative and postgerminative periods are related to a phosphorylation process.\n\nA general role of recycling of respired CO, and replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates for amino acid and protein synthesis has been assigned to seed PEPC (Blanke and Lenz, 1989;Macnicol and Jacobsen, 1992;Podestá and Plaxton, 1994a, 199413). The enzyme has also been implicated in the acidification and malate accumulation processes during maturation, but not germination, of barley grain (Macnicol et al., 1992;Drozdowicz and Jones, 1995). PEPC activity increases during germination of Ricinus communis (Sangwan et al., 1992;Podestá andPlaxton, 1994a, 1994b) and Sorghum seeds (Khayat et al., 1991). In wheat seeds (aleurone-endosperm), our results show that total PEPC activity is relatively constant, but the specific activity increases about 50% during the first 48 h of imbibition and then decreases slightly, thereby indicating the general stability of this protein during germination. Seed PEPC was immunologically characterized in soluble protein extracts and shown to be composed mainly of 103-kD subunits. The less-abundant 108-kD PEPC form, which started to accumulate soon after the beginning of imbibition, possibly represents a newly synthesized isoform or results from a posttranslational modification of the preexisting 103-kD subunit; in the same way, the 100-kD PEPC could be a proteolytic product of this major subunit. Different PEPC isoforms were also described in germinating R. communis cotyledons (Podestá andPlaxton, 1994a, 1994b), where it was proposed that the 103and 108-kD polypeptides were different subunits of a heterotetrameric PEPC (Sangwan et al., 1992). Although the behavior of PEPC activity was studied during seed maturation and germination, in none of these previous studies was the phosphorylation of seed PEPC examined. In C, plants, this posttranslational regulation has been suggested to be a mechanism that helps coordinate the activity of the two cycles (C, and Calvin-Benson cycles) characteristic of C, photosynthesis. In this context, phosphorylationlactivation of C, PEPC is via a light-dependent transduction pathway that controls the activity of the C, PEPC kinase (Echevarría et al., 1990;Jiao et al., 1991;Pierre et al., 1992). Phosphorylation of the target Ser in the N-terminal domain interactively regulates the antagonistic effects of the photosynthesis-related allosteric metabolites L-malate and Glc-6-P (Duff et al., 1995) and the pH-dependent catalytic activity (Echevarría et al., 1994).\n\nNonphotosynthetic PEPC isoforms have been shown to be radiolabeled in vivo in detached wheat leaves and soybean nodules (Van Quy et al., 1991;Duff and Chollet, 1995;Zhang et al., 1995). Likewise, changes in the malate sensitivity related to the phosphorylation status of PEPC have been reported in guard cells during stomatal opening (Schnabl et al., 1992;Zhang et al., 1994) and in C, leaves during illumination of N-recovering seedlings (Van Quy and Champigny, 1992;Duff and Chollet, 1995). In seeds, a putative phosphorylation domain was shown to be present in the deduced N terminus of PEPC from soybean (Sugimoto et al., 1992). Therefore, it seems that whenever an increase in PEPC activity is required in a physiological context, the malate pool is expected to increase and, thus, PEPC needs enhanced protection (phosphorylation) against this feedback inhibitor for the carboxylation reaction to proceed efficiently in these adverse conditions. PEPC activity in wheat seed extracts was found to be subject to metabolite regulation. The calculated IC,, for L-malate of dry seed PEPC was found to be 0.1 2 0.03 mM (Fig. 3) at a pH of 7.3 and PEP concentration of 2.5 mM, and inhibition by this compound was antagonized by the activator Glc-6-P (data not shown). Seed PEPC forms crossreacted with the APS-IgG, resulting in changes in properties that mimicked phosphorylation, i.e. an increase in velocity at pH 7.1 and a decrease in malate sensitivity, and were phosphorylated in vitro by an endogenous protein kinase(s). The results reported here underscore the fact that these PEPC forms possess the consensus phosphorylation domain containing a putative regulatory Ser, and that the N terminus of wheat seed PEPC is highly implicated in the modification of its regulatory properties and catalytic activity, like its C, and C, counterparts. A Ser in the phosphorylation domain was shown to be present in the predicted N terminus of PEPC from soybean seeds (Sugimoto et al., 1992). Similarly, the protein kinase activity from seeds has the enzymatic characteristics of a PEPC kinase in terms of site recognition and activity (Fig. 4). A partial inhibitory effect of EGTA on PEPC phosphorylation in desalted crude extracts was observed (data not shown). Evidence that Ca2+-dependent and Ca'+-independent PEPC kinase activities are present in C,-leaf extracts was previously reported (Echevarría et al., 1988;Bakrim et al., 1992;Ogawa et al., 1992;Li and Chollet, 1993), but this point needs further investigation before any conclusion can be reached on seed PEPC kinase(s). Since the 103-kD PEPC form seems to be the major isoform radiolabeled in situ, it could play an important physiological role in germinating seeds. The findings that seed PEPC can be phosphorylated both in vitro and in situ by an endogenous PEPC kinase indicate that a11 of the \"machinery\" for PEPC phosphorylation is present and functional during germination of wheat seeds.\n\nTo detect changes in the in vivo phosphorylation state of PEPC during germination, we used an assay based on the determination of the ratio between optimal and suboptimal PEPC activity, formerly described for the C, PEPC from Sorghum (Echevarría et al., 1994). This velocity test is both sensitive and rapid, and thus possesses advantages over the classical malate-sensitivity test, especially when a low phosphorylation state of PEPC and high proteolytic and protein phosphatase activities are to be found in crude extracts. As described by Nimmo et al. (1986), partia1 proteolysis of Bryophyllum fedtschenkoi PEPC results in changes in malate sensitivity not related to the phosphorylation process, thereby leading to a misinterpretation of the results. Using this velocity test, we showed that the pH 8:pH 7.3 PEPC activity ratio decreases b y 27% during the first 4 d of germination (Fig. 6). This decrease was amplified to 38% when the pH 8:pH 7.1 activity ratio w a s determined. For reference, the complete i n vitro phosphorylation of the Sorghum leaf C, PEPC b y the catalytic subunit of cAMPdependent protein kinase led to a 64% decrease i n this latter activity ratio (Echevarría e t al., 1994).\n\nThe present results pave the w a y for studies on the purification and determination of the functional properties of PEPCs a n d PEPC kinase(s) from wheat seeds. In addition, it should be investigated whether a signal transduction chain controls the phosphorylation of PEPC during both germination a n d maturation of seeds.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1996 American Society of Plant Biologists.
