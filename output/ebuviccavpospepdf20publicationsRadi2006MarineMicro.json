    "abstract": "Palynological analyses of 60 surface sediment samples from estuarine environments near Vancouver Island, including the Georgia Strait (GS), the Effingham (EFF) and the Seymour-Belize (SB) Inlets were performed in order to document the distribution of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and their relationship to hydrographic conditions, productivity and nutrient concentrations. We tested transfer functions using the analogue method, and suggest that dinoflagellate cyst assemblages can be used to reconstruct primary productivity, temperature and salinity. The EFF and SB Inlets are characterized by a dominance of autotrophic taxa, particularly Operculodinium centrocarpum, whereas the Protoperidinioid and gymnodinial heterotrophic taxa such as Quinquecuspis concreta and Brigantedinium spp. dominate the assemblages of the GS. Multivariate analysis shows that this distribution is closely linked to primary productivity, sea-surface temperature (SST) and spring silica concentration. The abundance of autotrophic taxa in the EFF and SB Inlets is associated with high primary productivity and low summer SST, indicating summer upwelling of coastal British Columbia, whereas the heterotrophic taxa that characterizes the GS assemblages are related to low productivity, high summer SST and high silica concentration during spring. Multivariate analysis shows that the most important environmental parameters related to dinocyst distribution in the restricted embayment of the GS, are distance to the shore, distance to Vancouver Harbor, spring sea surface salinity (SSS), spring phosphate concentration and spring productivity. The autotrophic taxa are generally more common in coastal and shallow waters, but Spiniferites ramosus and Pentapharsodinium dalei show an opposite correlation to spring productivity and salinity. P. dalei is particularly abundant around Vancouver Harbor, near highly urbanized shores and within the Fraser River plume, where salinity is low and spring productivity and continental runoff are high. S. ramosus shows its highest abundance on the western coast of GS. Protoperidinioid and gymnodinial cysts characterize distal zones within the central and southern GS that are associated with a mixture of brackish waters coming from the Fraser River and deep upwelling waters entering the GS via Juan de Fuca Strait. The relationship between dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and primary productivity in these estuarine systems differs from that in oceanic and outer neritic zones, where the abundance of heterotrophic taxa is commonly associated with upwelling and high productivity.",
    "full_text": "Estuaries act as nutrient traps, receiving high organic and inorganic inputs from rivers, resulting in high primary productivity. Globally, estuarine systems have been the focus of research programs aimed at understanding the relationships between their physical environments and their biota, as well as anthropogenic influences on both (e.g., Bricker et al., 1999).\n\nSeveral papers on the relationships between dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) and environmental conditions published in the last decade highlight the potential for dinocyst assemblages in surface sediment to serve as proxies of anthropogenic eutrophication (e.g., Thorsen and Dale, 1997;Dale, 1996Dale, , 2001;;Dale et al., 1999;Matsuoka, 1999;Pospelova et al., 2002Pospelova et al., , 2004Pospelova et al., , 2005)). A high relative abundance of Lingulodinium machaerophorum and Selenopemphix quanta has been associated with eutrophication in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (e.g., Saetre et al., 1997;Dale et al., 1999Dale et al., , 2002;;Sangiorgie and Donders, 2004), but these species respond inversely to anthropogenic eutrophication in some particular estuaries. For instance, their relative abundances increase with eutrophication in the shallow estuaries of Massachusetts (Pospelova et al., 2002) but decrease with eutrophication in Tokyo Bay (Matsuoka, 1999). Thus, the interpretation of specific ecological requirements is not indisputable. In coastal upwelling zones, an increase in relative abundance of Protoperidinioid heterotrophic cysts is often interpreted as the result of an increase in primary productivity and upwelling intensity (Lewis et al., 1990;Marret, 1994;Zonneveld, 1997a;Zonneveld et al., 1997Zonneveld et al., , 2001;;Dale et al., 2002;Radi and de Vernal, 2004;Pospelova et al., 2006). However, this interpretation cannot be extrapolated to estuarine systems (Pospelova et al., 2002).\n\nIn this study we documented the relationships between modern sediment dinocyst assemblages and parameters such as sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), primary productivity and nutrient concentrations in the Georgia Strait (GS) and the Seymour-Belize (SB) and the Effingham (EFF) Inlets (Fig. 1, Table 1), British Columbia (Canada). These estuaries are characterized by high primary productivity (N260 gC m -2 year -1 ), sustaining commercial fisheries (Ware and Thomson, 1991;Beamish and Bouillon, 1993;Robinson and Ware, 1999;Beamish et al., 1999;Mackas et al., 2001). The three studied areas have different oceanographic settings and are characterized by different mechanisms of nutrient enrichment. The nitrogen budget for GS is influenced by mixing due to estuarine and tidal currents. The natural nitrogen input from upwelling is about ten times higher than the an-thropogenic input via the Fraser River (Harrison et al., 1994;Mackas and Harrison, 1997). However, inlets and fjords that have low flushing rates and/or are adjacent to urban centers, such as Burrard Inlet, are sensitive to anthropogenic nutrient input (Key, 1989;West et al., 1994;Schmitt et al., 1994;Harrison et al., 1994;Mackas and Harrison, 1997). SB and EFF Inlets are not subjected to high anthropogenic nutrient input (Thomson, 1981).\n\nDocumenting the distribution of dinocysts in these estuaries provides an opportunity to discriminate between oceanic and terrestrial influences, and between natural and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment on dinocyst production, which can eventually provide a basis for paleoceanographic reconstructions in near-shore Quaternary sediments. The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a modern data set of dinocyst assemblages to reconstruct quantitatively environmental parameters in estuarine systems by using the modern analogue method (e.g. Guiot, 1990;de Vernal et al., 2001).\n\nThe SB and EFF Inlets are wide fjords located on the southwestern coast of Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia, respectively, and directly connected to the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1). Both inlets are similar in their oceanographic characteristics and fairly typical examples of most BC fjords, which are directly influenced by ocean waters. The maximum water depth recorded in the SB and EFF Inlets is about 350 and 210 m respectively. The inlets are partially mixed estuaries, due to active tidal action and relatively low continental runoff. The oceanographic regime of the northeastern Pacific, linked to the atmospheric circulation pattern of the North Pacific, constitutes the main control on their oceanographic setting. The North Pacific summer highpressure atmospheric cell results in strong northerly winds, which in combination with the strong, southerly flowing California current enhances Ekman transport of surface waters, producing strong upwelling. The upwelling intensity can reach 20 to 40 m 3 s -1 /km of coastline from July through September (NOAA; http://  www.pfeg.noaa.gov/index.html), and its influence can be seen in the distribution of temperature, salinity and productivity (Fig. 2). This seasonal upwelling is the principal mechanism providing nutrients to the inlets and coastal zones of BC (Thomson, 1981;Thomson et al., 1989;Mantua et al., 1997;Thomson and Gower, 1998). Inlets have high primary productivity, low surface water temperatures and high salinity during summer (Fig. 3).  Barker, 1974;Thomson, 1981 andThomson et al., 1989).\n\nThe low population density and low levels of agricultural activity, in addition to limited runoff (b 14 m 3 s -1 ) in the EFF and SB Inlets (Pickard, 1963) probably result in a minimal impact of human activity on nutrient inputs (Thomson, 1981).\n\nBottom waters in both inlets are subject to anoxic to hypoxic conditions, with oxygen concentration below 1.8 ml l -1 , thus limiting benthic fauna and resulting in the preservation of laminated sediments (Patterson et al., 2000).\n\nGeorgia Strait represents a semi-enclosed, broad, shallow basin (222 km long; 28 km wide, 6900 km 2 approx. area), which separates Vancouver Island from the mainland of BC (Fig. 1). Average and maximum water depths are 155 m and 420 m respectively (Thomson, 1981). Its shores are the most densely populated region of BC (75% of total), with 3 million inhabitants (Statistics Canada; http://www.statcan.ca). The GS has intensive shipping traffic as the most used marine channel in BC. Urban development, with its associated industrial and commercial activities, contributes significantly to marine environmental degradation (Key, 1989;Mackas and Harrison, 1997). For instance, inputs from rivers, sewage, groundwater discharges and atmospheric deposition amount to ∼ 285 t N day -1 (Yin et al., 1995;Mackas and Harrison, 1997) and nutrient concentrations are high (Fig. 4). Enhanced productivity results in chlorophyll concentrations reaching as high as 20 μg l -1 in the Fraser plume. Primary productivity in GS ranges from 260 to 290 gC m -2 year -1 on average, as derived from satellite observations (Antoine et al., 1996). The GS has noticeable gradients of nutrient concentrations, due to the Fraser River input and exchanges with the open ocean, mainly through the southern passage. The southern GS is characterized by higher nutrient concentrations during the winter (Fig. 4), lower ones in the summer, probably because of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton. Dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom waters ranges between 1.5 and 3 ml l -1 (Fig. 5).\n\nThe Fraser River drains approximately 25% of BC and contributes 75% of the freshwater flowing into the GS. Its annual flow is about 140 km 3 , i.e. ∼11,000 m 3 s -1 during summer (June-July) and ∼1000 m 3 s -1 during winter (February-March), averaging 4400 m 3 s -1 (Mosher and Thomson, 2002). The Fraser River also delivers about 10 to 30 × 10 9 kg year -1 of particulate matter (Johannesen et al., 2003).\n\nDissolved and particulate organic carbon are mainly derived from in situ primary production (855 × 10 6 kg yr -1 ) and the Fraser River discharge (550 × 10 6 kg yr -1 ), while other rivers (200 × 10 6 kg yr -1 ), and anthropogenic sources (120 × 10 6 kg yr -1 ) account for less (Johannesen et al., 2003).\n\nThe water column is highly stratified, especially within the brackish plume of the Fraser River (Figs. 5 and 6). The freshwater influx in the central and southern parts of the GS is characterized by a classical 2-layer estuarine exchange with the open ocean. The upper layer is less than about 50 m and characterized by strong seasonal and latitudinal variation in SST (13 to 16 °C in August, 6 to 7 °C in February; Fig. 2). In the lower layer, temperatures are about 8 to 9.5 °C over the entire basin (Fig. 5), and nearly uniform throughout the year (Thomson, 1981;Masson, 2006). Brackish-low salinity upper waters circulate toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca, whereas deep ocean water circulates northwards (Thomson, 1981;LeBlond, 1983;Pawlowicz and Farmer, 1998;Fig. 7). This pattern is enhanced during the summer by the Fraser River freshet and intensive upwelling, but can be modified by tidal mixing and tidal streams (Thomson, 1981;LeBlond et al., 1991;Marinone and Pond, 1996). In spring and summer, the Fraser River freshet forms a strong brackish layer over a large area of the GS (Fig. 6), creating a stable stratification in combination with increased air temperature. Summer upwelling occurs along the Northeastern Pacific margin and Juan de Fuca Strait, and cold up welled waters reach the southern part of the GS where they mix with brackish Fraser River water (Fig. 7). Currents, hydrographic conditions, and nutrient concentrations show considerable seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations (Masson and Cummins, 2000;Masson, 2002), but the inter-annual or inter-decadal variability has only a small effect on phytoplankton communities and productivity in the study area (Li et al., 2000).\n\nAll samples (Fig. 1, Table 1) were taken from the upper few centimeters of gravity or box cores, which were collected during various cruises onboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ships (CCGS) Victor or John P. Tully (see Table 1). Sedimentation rates generally range from 0.5 to 2 cm year -1 , but can reach as much as 10 cm year -1 in the Fraser delta (Evoy et al., 1993;Hart et al., 1998;Patterson et al., 2000). We therefore assumed that the surface sediment samples represented about 5 years of deposition or less, and thus \"modern\" conditions.\n\nSamples for palynological treatments were processed at the Centre de recherche en géochimie et en géodynamique (GEOTOP) of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) using standard procedures (de Vernal et al., 1999). Five cm 3 of wet sediment was sieved to remove coarse silt, sand (106 μm sieve) and clay particles (10 μm sieve). To dissolve carbonate and silica particles, the 10-106 μm fraction was treated with warm  (∼40°C) HCl (10%) and HF (49%). HCl digestion lasted no longer than 20 min to avoid degradation of sensitive taxa. The residue was sieved at 10 μm and mounted between a slide and cover slide in glycerin gel. Dinocysts were identified and counted using light microscopy at 250× to 1000×. More than 200 cysts were identified and counted in most samples (Table 1). Cyst concentrations, per gram of dry weight sediment (cysts g -1 ), were assessed using the marker grain method (Mathews, 1969).\n\nThe taxonomical nomenclature follows Rochon et al. (1999), Head et al. (2001), and Pospelova and Head (2002). The assemblages include cysts of Polykrikos kofoidii, described by Morey-Grains and Ruse (1980), Matsuoka (1987) and Matsuoka and Cho (2000). Additional remarks upon northern and northeastern Pacific specimens are given in Radi et al. (2001) and Radi and de Vernal (2004), with illustrations. The original descriptions from Zonneveld (1997b), Zonneveld and Jurkschat (1999) and Head (2002) were used to identify Echinidinium species and Bitectatodinium spongium. Many specimens belonging to the Protoperidiniales were grouped into 'Protoperidinioid' due to the difficulty in identifying at species or genus level. Bri-gantedinium simplex and Brigantedinium cariacoence are grouped into Brigantedinium spp. because archeopyles were often not observed due to orientation. Rare specimens of the O. centrocarpum-morphotype short processes (de Vernal et al., 2001) were observed and were grouped with O. centrocarpum. Only rare specimens of Impagidinium paradoxum, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Spiniferites mirabilis, Operculodinium janduchenei, Echinidinium zonneveldiae and Islandinium brevispinosum were observed, and excluded from the statistical analysis.\n\nSea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll data (0 m) were obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2001 CD-ROM (WOA01) of the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC, 2001; http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA01/pr_woa01.  html). CD-ROM documentation, as well as data statistics, analyses and compilation of the in situ measurements made until 2001 are documented in Conkright et al. (2002a,b), Stephens et al. (2002) and Boyer et al. (2002). Productivity levels were estimated using the algorithms developed by Antoine et al. (1996) and Antoine and Morel (1996) based on chlorophyll concentration provided by satellite observations (Coastal Zone Color Scanner, CZCS). The relationship between radiance and marine photosynthesis is given in Morel (1978Morel ( , 1991)). Primary productivity in the productive layer was computed from the integrated chlorophyll content of the water column and the photosynthetically active radiation (cf. Antoine et al., 1996;Antoine and Morel, 1996). In the GS, additional nutrient data were compiled from measurements made between 2002 and 2005 trough the Strait of Georgia Ecosystem Modeling (STRATOGEM) project (http://www.stratogem.ubc.ca/data.html). Monthly and seasonal averages were calculated for all parameters cited above. However, in some cases, the measurement locations are not the same as our sites, so we interpolated that data using the MapInfo program and the \"Inverse Distance Weighting\" (IDW) technique (http://extranet.  mapinfo.com).\n\nStatistical analyses were done using CANOCO for Windows 4.0. (ter Braak and Smilauer, 1998). Because of heterogeneity in the distribution of our sampling sites, two data sets were defined for multivariate analysis: data set DS1 includes all samples of the GS, and the EFF and SB Inlets (60 samples and 25 taxa), while data set DS2 includes only GS samples (40 samples and 25 taxa). In order to test the nature of variability of dinocyst assemblages, Detrended Correspondence Analyses (DCA) were done on both data sets. The length of the first gradient, which is given in standard deviation (S.D.) units, is 1.99 and 1.43 for DS1 and DS2 respectively (Table 2), indicates that dinocyst percentages show linear variation within the study area, conditions that are suitable for indirect analyses (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) or direct analyses (Redundancy Analysis, RDA), which is the linear equivalent of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (Jongman et al., 1995;ter Braak and Smilauer, 1998). RDA allows us to extract the most significant synthetic gradient from field data on dinocyst communities and environmental variables.\n\nRDA was performed on the DS1 and DS2 data sets with all environmental parameters available. For DS1, 21 environmental variables were used, including seasonal sea-surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS), seasonality of temperature and salinity (difference be- tween winter and summer), seasonal and annual primary productivity, phosphate and nitrate concentrations during spring, silica concentration during spring and summer, chlorophyll concentration during summer and water depth. For DS2, phosphate, nitrate and silica data were available for all seasons. Distance from the shore and distance from Vancouver Harbor were also added to the RDA analyses. All dinocyst and environmental data used in these analyses are included in Appendices A and B.\n\nForward selection was used to reduce the set of variables to a smaller set sufficient to explain variation in species composition. The environmental variables were ranked by importance on the basis of the fit for each separate variable as the only environmental variable (marginal effect), and on the basis of the fit that each separate variable gave in conjunction with the variables already selected (conditional effect). The statistical significance of each variable was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test under the null model with 199 random permutations. Environmental variables were deemed significantly related to the species data when Pvalue was less than 0.05.\n\nIn order to evaluate the potential to reconstruct SST, SSS and productivity, from data on the dinocyst assemblage, transfer functions were tested using the multiple regression technique (MRT) and the modern analogue technique (MAT).\n\nThe MRT-based transfer function was made using JMP 5.1 software (http://www.jmpin.com). For the MAT, fossil assemblages were compared with a database of modern assemblages in order to find the best analogues according to the coefficient of similarity.  The environmental values corresponding to the best analogues were then weighted by this coefficient to reconstruct paleoenvironments (see Overpeck et al., 1985;Guiot, 1990). Validation tests were made using the 3PBase software (Guiot and Goeury, 1996; http://  www.imep-cnrs.com/pages/3pbase.htm). Evaluation of the adequacy of each approach was made by comparing reconstructed and observed values using the Jackknife (or leave-one-out) method, where estimates are obtained by removing one site from the calibration data set. Each estimate was thus based on n-1 observations (cf. Efron and Gong, 1983). Accuracy of the approach was assessed by the coefficient of correlation between estimated and observed values, and the standard deviation of the difference between reconstructed and observed values, which is the equivalent of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\n\nPalynomorphs in general and dinocysts in particular, were abundant and well preserved. In the GS, dinocyst concentrations varied between 400 and 13,000 cysts g -1 , with an average of 3154 cysts g -1 . Such concentrations are comparable to values observed in some European (e.g., Dale et al., 1999;Harland et al., 2004a,b) and North American (Pospelova et al., 2004(Pospelova et al., , 2005) ) estuaries, but are low in comparison to values for the EFF and SB Inlets which were commonly higher than 25,000 cysts g -1 , and up to as much as 137,000 cysts g -1 in the EFF Inlet (Table 1).\n\nDinocyst assemblages in all samples were characterized by relatively high species diversity, with a total of 35 taxa identified and systematically counted (Fig. 8). The EFF and SB Inlets were characterized by similar associations, with dominance of O. centrocarpum, whereas the GS was characterized by the dominance of heterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa such as Q. concreta and Brigantedinium spp. In the GS some taxa, e.g. P. dalei and Spiniferites ramosus showed positive or negative gradients in relative abundance from Vancouver Harbor to offshore (Figs. 8 and 9).\n\nThe results of forward selection (Tables 3 and 4) showed environmental variables ranked by their importance when analyzed separately (marginal effect) or in conjunction with other variables (conditional effect). The importance of variables according to their eigenvalues was not the same for the marginal and conditional effects due to co-variability. For example, in the DS1 (Table 3), summer Chlorophyll had a higher eigenvalue when analyzed singly (λ = 0.28) than when analyzed with other parameters (λ = 0.02) because a large part of the chlorophyll effect can be explained by summer productivity. The conditional effect of chlorophyll was thus ordered tenth with λ = 0.02 and Pvalue = 0.18 (Table 3). Only variables with statistically significant P-values (b 0.05) were selected. The RDA ordination diagrams for DS1 and DS2 are shown in Figs. 10 and 11.\n\nThe results of the RDA (DS1; Fig. 10; Tables 2 and 3) show that the first ordination axis, explaining 31.2% of the variance, is significantly and positively correlated with annual and summer primary productivity, winter temperature and autumn salinity, and negatively correlated with water depth, summer temperature and dissolved silica concentration in spring and summer. The distribution of species along the first axis shows that autotrophic taxa, particularly O. centrocarpum, are ordinated on the positive side, whereas Q. concreta, Brigantedinium spp. and other heterotrophic Protoperidinioid cysts are ordinated on the negative side. The second axis explaining 6.4% of the variance, shows opposite ordinations of P. dalei and S. ramosus, and is not clearly correlated with any environmental variable (Fig. 10).\n\nFor the DS2 data set (only GS samples), results of the RDA show that only 7 of the 34 environmental variables tested are statistically significant (P b 0.05; Fig. 11, Table 4). The first ordination axis (23.8% of the species data variance), which mainly separates autotrophic from heterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa, is negatively correlated with the distance from the shore. Silica concentration during summer and water depth show a significant relationship with the first ordination axis but the coefficient of correlation is relatively low (Table 4, Fig. 11). All autotrophic taxa, including O. centrocarpum, P. dalei and S. ramosus, are ordinated positively along axis 1 (Fig. 11), with highest abundances in shallow, coastal stations. Heterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa, such as Q. concreta, Selenopemphix nephroides, S. quanta and P. kofoidii are ordinated negatively along axis 1, with their highest abundances in areas of the southern and central GS far from shore. The second ordination axis (15.4% of the variance), which separates P. dalei and S. ramosus, is positively correlated with spring productivity (Fig. 11) and negatively correlated with distance to Vancouver Harbor, SSS and phosphate concentration during spring. The relative abundance of  different taxa, along with the RDA axes scores, allow us to distinguish 3 assemblages in the GS (Figs. 8, 11 and 12):\n\nAssemblage zone 1 is characterized by relatively low cyst concentrations, ranging from 240 to 1700 cysts g -1 (average = 974 cysts g -1 ). These dinocyst assemblages are characterized by high percentages of P. dalei (up to 30%). RDA axes 1 and 2 show positive values. This assemblage zone seems to be related to urbanization, and is associated with the Fraser River Plume.\n\nAssemblage zone 2 is characterized by a slightly higher cyst concentration, with an average of ∼1800 cysts g -1 . Q. concreta, Brigantedinium spp. and other protoperidinial cysts dominate the assemblages. The first ordination axis shows negative scores. This zone is associated with the central and southern GS, and thus perhaps influenced by up welled oceanic water during summer.\n\nAssemblage zone 3 is characterized by high dinocyst concentrations (up to 13,000 cysts g -1 ), high percentages of S. ramosus (40% at station V53), O. centrocarpum, S. elongatus and Spiniferites spp. Percentages of Q. concreta and Brigantedinium spp. are relatively low. The second ordination axis shows negative scores. Assemblage zone 3 is associated with the western side of the GS, i.e., not affected by the direct influence of Fraser River.\n\nResults of cross-validation exercises done with DS1 by the modern analogue technique (Fig. 13) represent reconstructions versus observations for SST, SSS and productivity, the most important parameters associated with dinocyst distribution in the GS, EFF and SB Inlets (see Figs. 10 and 11). Although the number of modern samples used is limited (60 samples), this exercise yields a  relatively good correlation (r 2 N 0.86) and low RMSE (Table 5). In order to test the reliability of the approaches further, we cross-validated using a larger data set by adding sites representative of neritic and oceanic domains of the northeastern Pacific, between 40 to 50°N (data from Radi and de Vernal, 2004) for a total of 123 sites (Fig. 14). This data set is therefore representative of a domain with wider ranges of environmental variables (Table 6).\n\nIn order to verify co-variation between all parameters, we did a PCA upon all environmental variables listed in Table 6. Nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations were significantly correlated with SST or SSS (Fig. 15). Seasonal SSS and winter SST also showed co-variation, mostly due to the relative influence of upwelling that determines the stratification of upper waters, and thus the salinity and thermal inertia at the surface. Nevertheless, both the winter SST and SSS were reconstructed. We considered only primary productivity, SST and SSS parameters for further reconstructions (Fig. 16).\n\nOverall, the modern analogue technique (MAT) and the multiple regression technique (MRT) yielded comparable reconstructionswithbothDS1(n = 60)andthelargedataset (n = 123), but the coefficient of correlation between reconstructed and observed values was higher, and the RMSE was lower, when using the MAT for SST and SSS (Table 5). Also, reconstruction of the primary productivity with MAT was more accurate than that made with MRT, especially when using the larger data set (n =123) as shown by the RMSE values (Table 5).\n\nDinocyst assemblages of estuarine environments of BC are characterized by the absence of open ocean taxa such as Pyxidinopsis reticulata and Impagidinium species, which are common in the northeastern Pacific margins (Radi and de Vernal, 2004). In general, our assemblages resemble those from coastal zones of eastern and western North Atlantic (e.g., Harland et al., 2004a,b;Pospelova et al., 2005), but the GS and the EFF-SB Inlets are differentiated by the occurrence of Echinidinium species and the absence of L. machaerophorum.\n\nEchinidinium spp. are rarely reported at middle to high latitudes in the North Atlantic, but are frequent in warm environments such as the northern Arabian Sea and along West African margins, where they are associated with high nutrient input (Zonneveld, 1997b;Zonneveld and Brummer, 2000;Susek et al., 2005). Echinidinium spp. are found (up to 5%) in most of the samples (see Fig. 8) from EFF, SB and GS, which indicates that these species are not restricted to warm environments, but are related to high productivity in areas with or without upwelling (see also Targarona et al., 1999;Vink et al., 2000;Zonneveld et al., 2001).\n\nIn some estuarine systems, such as the Oslo Fjord (Norway), an increase in dinocyst concentration, along with an increase in relative abundance of the autotrophic taxon L. machaerophorum have been interpreted as indicating high anthropogenic nutrient input, or eutrophication (Dale and Fjellså, 1994;Dale et al., 1999). In  Yokohama Port, an increase of dinocyst concentration combined with an increase of heterotrophic taxa is also interpreted as indicating eutrophication (Matsuoka, 1999). Low concentrations of dinocysts, combined with dominant heterotrophic taxa indicate industrial pollution within Frier Fjord in south-western Norway (Saetre et al., 1997). Saetre et al. (1997) argued that the increase in heterotrophic taxa reflected food availability (e.g. diatoms), which fosters heterotrophic dinoflagellates, or reduced light penetration in the water column that discriminates against autotrophic taxa. The response of assemblages may therefore differ from one region to another, depending upon the exact form of eutrophication (see Dale et al., 1999 andMatsuoka, 2001 for a discussion). The GS, which is more strongly affected by human activities than the EFF and SB Inlets, has lower concentrations and higher percentages of heterotrophic dinocysts, quite similar to the Frier Fjord (Saetre et al., 1997).\n\nOverall, the relationship between primary productivity or nutrient concentration and dinocyst concentration has not yet been clearly established quantitatively in oceanic or estuarine domains. Nevertheless, in many The small data set (DS1 + DS2) includes EFF-SB Inlets and GS alone, whereas the large data set (n = 123) includes, in addition to EFF-SB Inlets and GS, 63 sites offshore BC spanning coastal and oceanic domains (data from Radi and de Vernal, 2004).

On this basis, Kumar and Patterson (2002) linked the increase in relative abundance of heterotrophic taxa in the outer basin of the EFF Inlet to high nutrient input due to upwelling. Our results show that the high productivity area of the EFF and SB Inlets is characterized by high dinocyst concentrations (Table 1), but not necessarily by high percentages of heterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa (Fig. 8). This observation is important because it illustrates the existence of relationships between dinocyst distribution and productivity in estuarine systems, which differs from that of marginal oceanic upwelling areas as documented previously (Marret, 1994;Zonneveld, 1997a;Zonneveld et al., 1997Zonneveld et al., , 2001;;Dale et al., 2002;Radi and de Vernal, 2004). Axis 1 of the RDA carried out on DS1, which separates GS (low scores) from EFF-SB (high scores; Fig. 10), corresponds to two distinct regimes of nutrient enrichment and productivity. The EFF and SB Inlets face the open ocean and may thus be more influenced by regional coastal processes, including the intense summer upwelling. This configuration, together with low continental runoff, results in relatively high SSS and low summer SST, in addition to high productivity. The opposite ordination of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa along axis 1 illustrates that there is a high relative abundance of Fig. 15. Results of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) carried out on the environmental variables in the n = 123 data set. The two axes represent respectively 61.8% and 23.4% of the total variance. Note that dinocyst data are excluded from this analysis, which allows us to identify the environmental variables that may co-vary and therefore allows us to select adequately the parameters that are to be used during reconstructions. The matrix of correlation coefficients (bottom) is based on linear relationships between the environmental parameters used in this PCA.\n\nheterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa at the lower productivity sites. Both silica concentration (during spring and summer) and heterotrophic taxa are ordinated along the negative side of this axis, corresponding to the GS domain. This suggests that heterotrophic dinoflagellates in the GS produce more cysts during spring and summer, when brackish water from the Fraser River and up welled water from the open ocean are strongly mixed in the upper layers, resulting in relatively high SST and high silica concentration. This interpretation assumes that the increase in heterotrophic Protopridinioid cysts could be supported by the spring bloom of diatoms, which are prey for heterotrophic dinoflagellates (Jacobson and Anderson, 1986;Gaines and Elbrachter, 1986) and usually bloom earlier than other phytoplankton groups (Harrison et al., 1983;Li et al., 2000). This shows that the Autotrophic/ Heterotrophic ratio cannot be used unmistakably as productivity or upwelling signal.\n\nIn coastal waters, upwelling and productivity often represent two covariant parameters that cannot be dissociated, but estuarine systems adjacent to upwelling cells, such as the GS, are characterized by two sources of nutrients (upwelling and continental runoff) and a large gradient in salinity (17 to 27). This gradient makes it possible to separate the influence of nutrients brought in by upwelling from that of nutrients brought in by continental runoff over a region characterized by a nearly uniform primary productivity. The abundance of autotrophic taxa in assemblages zones 1 and 3 within the GS is more likely related to coastal and shallow environments, where continental runoff and water column stratification are strong, especially within the area of the Fraser River plume (see Figs. 5, 6 and 7), as supported by the RDA showing a negative correlation between axis 1 and the distance to the shore and water depth (Fig. 11). The increase in percentage of heterotrophic taxa (assemblage zone 2; Figs. 11 and 12) in the central and southern part of the GS is more likely associated with deeper and less stratified waters, as illustrated by the ordination of both distance to the shore and water depth on the negative side of the axis 1. Both axes 1 and 2 are negatively correlated with SSS and phosphate concentrations during spring, indicating that assemblage zone 2 may be associated with relatively high SSS and phosphate concentration during spring, and high silicate concentration during summer (Fig. 11), from surface waters consisting of brackish water mixed with saline up welled water.\n\nHigh percentages (up to 30%) of P. dalei in the Fraser River plume and close to Vancouver Harbor characterize assemblage zone 1 (Figs. 11 and 12). This species has been recorded to be abundant in fjords and estuarine environments adjacent to the North Atlantic (Dale, 1976(Dale, , 1977;;Nehring, 1997;Persson et al., 2000), and is a common component of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Norwegian and Swedish fjords (Dale, 1977;Harland et al., 2004a). Little is known about the ecological affinities of this taxon in estuarine systems, but Harland et al. (2004b) suggested that it is opportunistic in zones of high anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Our results show that low salinity and high spring productivity, corresponding to the beginning of fresh water input in the Burrard Inlet (Vancouver Harbor), seem to be the most favorable for this taxon. The highly significant correlation between axis 2 and distance to Vancouver Harbor (Fig. 11), which represents the most densely populated region, suggests that human activity may strongly influence dinocyst distribution, but we do not find a positive correlation between nutrient concentrations and axis 2. This is probably because the largest source of nutrients in the GS comes from the Pacific Ocean through Juan the Fuca Strait during upwelling season (Mackas and Harrison, 1997). Phosphate concentration during spring, silica concentration during summer and heterotrophic taxa show the same negative ordination along axes 1 and 2 (Fig. 11), illustrating the high phosphate and silica concentrations and high percentages of heterotrophic taxa far from Vancouver Harbor (Fig. 11). The negative correlation between silica concentration and axes 1 and 2 probably illustrates the influence of upwelling upon dinocyst assemblages, as silica is not abundant in anthropogenic effluents (sewage or agricultural runoff) as are nitrate and phosphate (cf. Anderson et al., 2002). Nitrate loading by Human activity does certainly influence dinocyst distribution by favoring autotrophic taxa near Vancouver Harbor, but this signal is not easy to detect because of the high nutrient inputs from upwelling. Thus, we assume that this signal is encoded in salinity. Finally, the dominance of gonyaulacales at the mouth of the Fraser River and the higher abundance of protoperidinials at sites distal from the river seems to be typical of environments influenced by both upwelling and high river discharge, as documented for assemblages of the Congo River plume and the upwelling region of East Africa (Dale et al., 2002).\n\nThe composition of dinocyst assemblages along the coast of BC is closely associated with environmental parameters, especially to SST, SSS and productivity. Therefore, it should be possible to use assemblage information in paleoceanographical reconstruction. Validation exercises done on the DS1 data set illustrate the identity of assemblages and their significance in terms of environmental conditions (Fig. 13), and demonstrate the accuracy of the approaches on a regional scale, especially when using the modern analogue technique (Table 5). Modern analogue technique is also reliable for reconstructions of sea surface conditions when using a larger data set (i.e. the n = 123 data set). A less accurate reconstruction with multiple regressions technique is probably due to the fact that this approach is based on the assumption of a linear species-environment response, which does not apply here. Annual primary productivity is reconstructed with a coefficient of correlation (r 2 ) of 0.90 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of ± 27.97 gC m -2 yr -1 (Fig. 16), close to the standard deviation of values estimated using chlorophyll data, i.e. ± 17% (Antoine and Morel, 1996). SST could be reconstructed with a reasonable degree of accuracy within the range of inter-annual variability (r 2 = 0.85, RMSE = ±0.60 °C for winter SST; r 2 = 0.72, RMSE = ± 0.72 °C for summer SST; Fig. 16). The standard deviation of measured SST for each month varies between ± 0.7 and ± 1.19 °C in winter and between ± 1.5 and ±2.82 °C in summer, depending upon site location (NODC, 2001), indicating that variability of SST is close to the RMSE of our validation tests. The reconstruction of salinity shows a larger scatter, with RMSEs of about ±0.87 and ±1.98 for winter and summer respectively (Fig. 16). The scatter is larger in the low salinity range influenced by continental runoff. Nevertheless, the RMSEs are lower than the standard deviations of measured salinity, which vary between ±3.31 and ±5.7 in winter and between ±4.62 and ±9.90 in summer (NODC, 2001). This extremely high variability in SSS is probably related to the variable influence of upwelling intensity and freshwater input from the Fraser River.\n\nDinocyst distribution in the estuarine systems of BC shows diversified assemblages with distinct associations. The highly productive EFF and SB Inlets are characterized by dominant autotrophic taxa, whereas GS assemblages are dominated by heterotrophic taxa. GS assemblages also show variation corresponding to spring productivity and the salinity gradient. In the GS, the autotrophic taxa, including P. dalei, S. ramosus and O. centrocarpum, apparently characterize coastal stratified water under the influence of continental runoff, whereas the heterotrophic Protoperidinioid taxa are common in areas influenced by up welled marine waters. In addition, high percentages of P. dalei close to Vancouver Harbor in the GS could be associated with the proximity to the highly urbanized shore, but also to freshwater input via the Fraser River during spring, which causes an increase in productivity. Our results provide evidence that there is a strong relationship between productivity, SST and SSS, and dinocyst distribution in surface sediments of estuarine systems of the northeastern Pacific.\n\nλ is the eigenvalue explained by environmental variable.
