    "full_text": "Le présent rapport donne un aperçu national des comités consultatifs publics oeuvrant dans le secteur des forêts. Il présente une compilation de statistiques descriptives établies à partir des résultats de deux sondages, l'un auprès des présidents des comités consultatifs (n = 101) et l'autre auprès des membres des comités (n = 1 079). L' étude donne un aperçu de la représentation du public, des valeurs des membres des comités, du rôle et du fonctionnement des comités consultatifs et du degré général de satisfaction à l' égard des processus des comités. Malgré l' existence de nombreuses variations régionales, les résultats dont fait état le présent rapport laissent supposer que les membres des comités sont généralement satisfaits de leur expérience au sein de ces comités consultatifs. Au nombre des défis que doivent relever de nombreux comités et qu' ont cerné les répondants figurent l' obtention de renseignements à jour et diversifiés, une représentation adéquate du public (notamment la participation des Autochtones) et les processus de groupe associés à l' établissement d'un consensus et à la prise de décisions. Le rapport se termine par des suggestions visant à améliorer l' efficacité générale des comités consultatifs dans le secteur forestier. . . 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.

This concept is reflected in numerous policy initiatives at the provincial and national levels, as well as a growing number of public processes that facilitate interaction between forestry professionals and the public. A general acknowledgment of the need to involve a wider range of public interests and values in the management of crown lands has also led to the emergence of various public processes and legal requirements. Although governments and forest companies use a variety of methods to interact with the public, such as surveys and open houses, advisory committees (also known as citizen committees or stakeholder committees) have become a central aspect of many forest planning processes across the country. Forest sector advisory committees represent a form of community-based public engagement, where local forest users (along with people involved in the forest sector for their livelihood, representatives of other local agencies such as educational establishments and the business community, and elected leaders) participate in discussions about forest management and provide input into local decision-making. Although their outcomes are rarely binding, these committees are intended to provide public oversight and guidance to the decision-makers who are responsible for the management of public resources.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, requirements for such advisory committees are now embedded within provincial regulations and forest management licensing procedures. In Ontario, although local citizen committees now represent a broader crosssection of public interests, they were first started by fishing and hunting clubs seeking to have input into road access and wildlife management issues. In British Columbia, land and resource management plans represent a type of government-sponsored advisory committee with a mandate for land use planning at the regional level. In other provinces, such as Alberta, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, advisory committees have originated primarily from forest companies and are now a legislated component of the forest planning process.\n\nIn addition to provincial legislation, forest certification initiatives such as the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management system (CSA 2002) and the Forest Stewardship Council's National Boreal Standard (FSC 2005) have strongly emphasized the use of advisory committees and have spelled out requirements for ongoing public consultation on forest planning and monitoring as a condition for certification. These market-based certification initiatives, along with various provincial legislative requirements, indicate a shift toward placebased public participation in the management of Canada's public forests.\n\nUnderlying this wave of interest is the belief that public participation will help to incorporate local knowledge and local values into forest planning processes. Concern about the integration of public knowledge and interests into forest management is also embedded in the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers' criteria and indicators framework for sustainable forest management (CCFM 2003). One of the elements in this framework deals with \"fair and effective decision-making,\" which is measured in part by \"the proportion of participants who are satisfied with public involvement processes in forest management in Canada\" (CCFM 2003, page 19). In addition to this national reporting framework, provincial agencies, such as the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (2002), have initiated reporting frameworks that require information on public participation in forest management.\n\nThe project described here was initiated, in part, to capture a national picture of public advisory committees in the forest sector and to provide baseline information for national and regional reporting purposes. This shift toward placebased public participation is a relatively recent phenomenon, and although some researchers have developed case studies of these nascent groups, no national analysis has yet been undertaken. Furthermore, because several provincial and national reporting frameworks require information on public participation processes, the development of a national-level data set on public participation was warranted. In an effort to extend this analysis beyond a simple count of public engagements or a list of available public processes, the study was designed to generate a basic profile of advisory committee functions and activity. It was intended to allow deeper analysis by providing some baseline information about issues such as public representation and inclusiveness, the demographic characteristics of committee members, the mandate of each committee, the types of information that are accessed by each committee, the effectiveness of group processes, and some recommendations by committee members for improvements to group processes. This report provides a broad overview of survey results; a more detailed analysis of the data, according to differences between male and female respondents and differences between private sector and public sector sponsorship of committees, will be undertaken in subsequent reports.\n\nFor this national study, a team of researchers embarked on a project in 2004 to identify and survey all known public advisory committees involved in forest planning and management. The exception to this census of committees was in Quebec, where, because of the high number of committees, a subset of known committees was surveyed. The project team represented a geographic distribution of researchers as well as a spectrum of academic disciplines, specifically geography, sociology, and forest science. The researchers (the first 5 authors of this report) contributed to all aspects of the study design and to the presentation of results in this report.\n\nThe project involved the design and administration of two questionnaires: one for the members of each advisory committee and one for the chair of each advisory committee (see Appendix 1 and 2). Design of the questionnaires involved extensive interaction among all five members of the research team. Each team member has broad experience in the social dimensions of forest management, some personal experience with the advisory committee processes in his or her region of the country, and a particular scholarly orientation to public participation processes. One of the key challenges in developing these questionnaires was making them generic enough to be applicable in all parts of the country and in many different types of advisory committee settings, but also specific enough to address some of the key issues raised in the literature. Several published reports were consulted to identify the key factors contributing to successful public participation and to identify criteria for evaluating effective public participation processes (Homenuck et al. 1977;Tuler and Webler 1999;Caron 2000;Chess 2000;Rowe and Frewer 2000;Carr and Halvorsen 2001;Halvorsen 2001;Coglianese 2003). Many of the ideas that these authors considered crucial to effective public participation were incorporated into the study design for the current project. The study also attempted to build on previous research with advisory committee members in two provinces (Parkins et al. 2001;Hunt and McFarlane 2002;McGurk et al. 2006).\n\nThe extensive literature on public participation in forest management reflects a growing recognition of the significant role that public values and public knowledge can play in making workable forest management decisions (Tanza and Howard 1991;Higgelke and Duinker 1993; Joint FAO/ECE/ILO Committee 2000). The Joint FAO/ECE/ILO Committee on Forestry Technology, Management and Training (2000, page 7) has defined public participation in forestry as \"various forms of direct public involvement where people, individually or through organized groups, can exchange information, express opinions, and articulate interests, and have the potential to influence decisions or the outcome of specific forestry issues.\" This definition identifies several specific features of public participation that were pertinent to this study, including attention to direct and indirect interaction between individuals, the exchange of information, and the opportunity to influence outcomes and affect change in forest management practices. Likewise, this national survey tapped into these aspects of public participation in some detail.\n\nOne area of considerable focus in public participation processes is the issue of group representation (Gundry and Heberlein 1984;McComas 2001), specifically the questions of who is involved and whether these committee members adequately represent public values. The first section of the member questionnaire used in this study addressed this question in some detail to gain insights into why members are involved, who they represent, and whether the committee is thought to be representative of all interested and affected groups. This section also included questions about forest values, the answers to which will afford future opportunity for statistical comparisons between the values of committee members and the values of the general public. Previous comparative research along these lines is already available for Alberta (McFarlane and Boxall 2000) and Ontario (Hunt and McFarlane 2002).\n\nA second area of considerable focus, the processes and procedures used within the committee itself, encompasses aspects of fairness and effectiveness that are thought to be crucial to group processes (Lawrence et al. 1997;Shindler and Neburka 1997;Lauber and Knuth 1999), along with various aspects of group deliberation, such as sources of information, time constraints, complexity, and outside pressures (Parkins and Mitchell 2005), and various learning outcomes (Sinclair and Diduck 2001). The chair and the member questionnaires addressed process and procedural issues in some detail. Finally, survey respondents provided insights into ways of improving the effectiveness of group activities and several measures of satisfaction with group activities.\n\nAlthough advisory committees are a popular form of public participation in the forest sector, the exact number of committees across Canada is unknown. To identify committees in various jurisdictions, contacts were made with government and industry officials, as well as with other researchers working in the field of public participation. The information gathered from these key informants revealed a diverse situation across the country, with some provinces having fewer than 10 committees and one province having more than 100. The study covered 9 of the 10 provinces and did not include any of the territories.\n\nIn all provinces except Quebec, the member questionnaire was administered to all members of identified committees. In Quebec, the large number of advisory committees made it impractical to survey every committee; therefore, a sample of advisory committees was selected for inclusion, with two considerations in mind: the needs of the CCFM (2003) national reporting framework and the needs of the Commission d' étude sur la gestion de la forêt publique québécoise (Commission for the Study of Public Forest Management in Québec, commonly known as the Coulombe Commission, which contributed funding for the survey work in Quebec). This commission has provided recommendations to the Quebec government on major changes to the provincial forest management system, including the role of public participation processes, and insights from the survey reported here were used by the Commission in formulating its report (Commission for the Study of Public Forest Management in Québec 2004).\n\nTo ensure that these requirements were met, the selection of Quebec committees was not totally random. Committees were selected from each of several specific geographic regions of the province. Also, only administrative regions with at least 50% public forest land were considered for inclusion. The need to find a balance between regions that were remote and those that were adjacent to major urban centres (i.e., Montréal, Québec and Ottawa-Gatineau) was also taken into consideration. These procedures resulted in the selection of 42 committees out of a total of 108 known committees that were advising either a forest company, a municipal government, or another group in the design of public forest management plans. Committees that were addressing forestry issues but were not providing advice on management plans were not included in the survey.\n\nAttempts were made to survey all known advisory committees associated with forest management in all of the other provinces. No central registry of advisory committees exists and advisory committee membership is dynamic in some provinces; it was therefore impossible to achieve a complete census of committees in each province. In addition, some committees that were invited to participate in the survey chose not to do so. For instance, in Ontario 40 local citizen committees were identified but members from only 30 committees participated. The lowest participation was in British Columbia, where 8 of 17 identified committees participated (see Table 1 for details on each province). Given the lower participation rates in some jurisdictions, it is important to consider the results from this survey with some caution. The reasons for nonresponse are not entirely clear, however, and bias in the sample is difficult to detect because little is known about nonparticipants. To some extent, nonresponse was likely due to the methods by which committee members were recruited. As noted in the following section, in most cases, the committee chairs acted as gatekeepers, and the general level of enthusiasm for the survey as expressed by the chairs to the committee members was probably a major factor in group participation.\n\nAnother weakness of this study is that it could not obtain the views of former committee members who had dropped out of a committee because of high levels of dissatisfaction. Therefore, the results are probably biased toward the views of local residents who continued to participate in committee processes and who were relatively more satisfied with existing processes and away from those who were no longer active in such committees. This sentiment was reflected by one former committee member who did participate in the study. \"I am no longer on the committee because I don't feel it served an important purpose as stated earlier. We didn't work on forest management but on public education.\"\n\nTable 1.

Table 2 refers to committee member surveys only.\n\nQuestionnaire for Advisory Committee Chairs The procedures for the questionnaire for advisory committee chairs, as well as the questionnaire for committee members (discussed below), followed the Dillman Tailored Design Method (Dillman 2000). For jurisdictions outside Quebec, questionnaires were sent to a total of 83 committee chairs (see questionnaire in Appendix 1). An email attachment or on-line questionnaire was used for all contacts who had email or Internet access (n = 64), and questionnaires were sent by mail for all others (n = 19). The survey was initiated in mid-September 2004. Two weeks later, those completing the questionnaire electronically received a reminder email. Two weeks after that, a final reminder email or a reminder letter with a copy of the questionnaire (depending on the original method of distribution) was sent to chairs who had not yet responded.\n\nFor the chairs of Quebec committees, all questionnaires were sent by mail, and follow-up phone calls were made to verify that they had received and completed the questionnaire.\n\nThe questionnaire for committee members (Appendix 2) was distributed in one of two ways: directly to the committee member by mail or, where committee member information was not available to the authors, indirectly to the committee member through the committee chair or another contact person. For all jurisdictions except Quebec, the questionnaires were mailed out or distributed to contacts in early April 2004. A reminder was sent to committee contacts in May and a reminder letter with a second copy of the questionnaire was sent to committee members for whom mailing addresses were available in early June. A final reminder notice was mailed to members in mid-September. In an effort to bolster the lower response rates from some Ontario committees, researchers made personal visits to several committees in fall 2004.\n\nIn Quebec, the study was delayed because of challenges posed by the large number of advisory committees that were identified and by the constraints of collaboration on another research project. In this province, all questionnaires were delivered by mail in the period from June to September, as contact information was collected. Most members had been notified by the chair of the committee that they would be contacted for this study. Two or three weeks after the questionnaire was first sent, a reminder card was posted to committee members who had not yet responded. About a month after the first mailing, a second questionnaire was sent to nonrespondents.\n\nSixty-one questionnaires were returned because of bad addresses, and a total of 2256 questionnaires were distributed to committee members across the country (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.

Questionnaires sent to chairs or contacts afforded no opportunity for follow-up with individual committee members and therefore no information on the number of questionnaires delivered.\n\nNOR-X-409\n\nFor most questionnaires completed by committee chairs, data entry occurred automatically as respondents completed the on-line questionnaire. Project staff entered data for all other questionnaires as they arrived by mail. For the committee member questionnaire, data entry for the English version was performed throughout fall 2004 in Edmonton, and data entry for the French version was performed in Fredericton over the same period. In both locations, project staff entered the data manually from each questionnaire to a spreadsheet. A common code book for quantitative data was developed to facilitate merging of databases and subsequent national analysis. For all quantitative data, the SPSS 12.0 for Windows (SPSS 2003) statistical software program was used to generate descriptive statistics. For all qualitative data (e.g., open-ended questions and questions requiring additional categorization), the QRS NVivo 2.0 (QRS NVivo 2002) qualitative software analysis program was used to assist with data organization and thematic coding. Qualitative data analysis was conducted separately in English and French, with a coordinated effort to combine results on several key questions. This report focuses on results from the descriptive statistics, but the results from several key open-ended questions are also discussed.\n\nDescriptive statistics are reported for most items from both questionnaires. In a few cases, data are not reported because the researchers thought that some respondents had misunderstood a question and hence that results were inaccurate. In addition, the responses to several of the openended questions will require further analysis and hence are not reported here; these results will be reported later.\n\nThe number of committees represented by responses to the survey of committee chairs (n = 101) was slightly different than the number of committees represented by responses to the survey of committee members (n = 102) because some committees participated in one survey and not the other; the distribution among regions also differed.\n\nFor the survey of committee chairs, 60 of the 83 questionnaires distributed outside of Quebec were returned, resulting in a response rate of 72%. In Quebec, 41 of 42 questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 98%. Of the 2256 questionnaires distributed to committee members, 1079 were returned, for an overall response rate of 47.8% (Table 1).\n\nThe survey of committee chairs was designed to obtain information about advisory committees that could be more easily provided by the sponsoring agency or the committee chair. It was hoped that this information would provide insight into several key committee attributes and hence context for the responses to the committee member survey.\n\nThere was an average of 21 members on the mailing list of the 101 committees for which a response was received from the committee chair, with the largest lists in the Prairies region (defined as Manitoba and Saskatchewan; see explanation below) and the smallest lists in Ontario (Table 3). On average, 13 members typically attended meetings, with the highest attendance in the Prairies region and the lowest attendance in Ontario.\n\nOn average, committees across Canada held eight meetings per year (Table 4). The frequency of meetings was highest in the Atlantic region (12) and lowest in the Prairies region (4). In 2004, committees had been operating for an average of 6.2 years, with the oldest committees in Ontario and Alberta and the youngest committees in British Columbia and Quebec. Some jurisdictions have a longer history with advisory committees than is reflected in Table 4. For instance, the land and resource management plan initiative in British Columbia was put into place more than 6 years ago, although it now appears to be giving way to more industry-driven processes. In Quebec, the emergence of numerous local committees in recent years reflects recent changes in provincial legislation.\n\nOne of the key distinctions among committees across Canada involves their sources of sponsorship (Table 5). In some regions, such as Ontario, the vast majority of committees whose chairs participated in the survey were sponsored by the provincial government. In other regions, including Alberta and British Columbia, all of the committees were sponsored by forest companies; in Quebec there was much more diversity in committee sponsorship. Most of the committees sponsored by forest companies were associated with certification activities, which mandate the use of advisory committees; see the guidelines of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC 2005) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA 2002).\n\nSources for committee facilitation were varied, with a considerable number of committees using professional facilitators (Table 6). A number of committees also relied on forestry company representatives or provincial and local government representatives to facilitate meetings, especially in Ontario.\n\nMost committees were called on to make decisions about various courses of action that would form the basis of recommendations to the sponsoring agency, and Table 7 shows the types of decision-making processes used by advisory committees. Some committees provided input into the development of local management standards negotiated between the sponsoring agency and the advisory committee. To make such recommendations, committees require some formal mechanism for making decisions and putting ideas forward to the sponsoring agency. For most committees in each region, this mechanism was a consensus-building process. As reported later, numerous committee members indicated that such processes were challenging; it was also challenging for the committees to put forward the majority view without compromising the interests of those in the minority (see section titled \"Opinions on sponsorship and group process\"). Some committees have attempted to develop a combination of consensus-building and voting techniques to assist in breaking deadlocks and in allowing the committee to move ahead with decisions in the absence of a clear consensus.\n\nFinally, the survey of committee chairs provided some information about the frequency and types of compensation for committee members (Table 8). The majority of committees in all regions except Quebec provided some form of payment for transportation costs; only 4 of 30 committees in Quebec offered financial assistance for transportation to all members.\n\nFor all other major categories of payment, the frequency of assistance was much lower. For instance, the majority of sponsors in two provinces, Ontario and Alberta, provided per diems, yet no committees in these provinces provided payment for child care and only a few provided compensation for loss of income. More committees provided financial assistance for conference travel, meals, refreshments, and items such as shirts, hats, and jackets featuring the logo of the committee or the sponsoring agency.\n\nTable 3.

New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland were grouped to form the Atlantic region, and Manitoba and Saskatchewan were combined to form the Prairies region. The proportion of responses that each region contributed to the total as well as the actual sample sizes are presented in Figure 1.\n\nThe provinces have different areas of forest land, so the survey results were weighted, such that each province's contribution to the total, labelled \"Canada\" in tables and graphics, would reflect the proportion of forest land that it contributes to the national total. For example, respondents from British Columbia accounted for 7% of survey respondents, but the province contains 19% of Canada's forest land; conversely, the Atlantic region accounted for 13% of survey respondents but contains 7% of Canada's forest. Factors were used to calculate the totals for Canada in the tables to bring the contribution of each region closer to the area of forest that is represented within each region.\n\nAge data for respondents are reported in Table 9, with more detailed demographic information provided in Appendix 3. Quebec respondents were much younger than those from elsewhere, with an average age of 44.8 years. Overall, 18.7% of the respondents were women, with the highest percentage of female respondents coming from British Columbia (31.6%) and the lowest from the Prairies region (10.3%). The national average of respondents who considered themselves Aboriginal was 7.2%; the Prairies had the highest percentage (20.8%) and Quebec the lowest (2.9%) (Fig. 2). The higher proportion of Aboriginal committee members in the Prairies region is due in part to legislative requirements in Saskatchewan that require comanagement arrangements with Aboriginal peoples. Almost half of respondents reported belonging to a community or social service group (44.6%), and 10.6% of respondents reported belonging to a natural history or bird-watching club. On average, over half of the respondents (54.1%) reported belonging to a household dependent on a resource industry. Just under 10% (9.6%) of respondents had not completed high school, with the highest proportion in the Prairies region (15.4%).

Ontario respondents most often identified a desire to contribute to planning as their motivation to participate, and this reason was the second most frequently identified motivation for respondents in the Atlantic, Quebec, Prairies, and British Columbia regions. There were also some significant differences in the reasons given for participating. For example, 54.5% of Alberta respondents and 81.1% of BC respondents cited concern for other (nonforestry) jobs. Also, a much greater proportion of Quebec respondents indicated that participation was a requirement of their job (Fig. 3) and that the agency sponsoring the committee had invited them to join the committee. These responses indicate some important institutional and motivational differences among committee members in different regions of the country.\n\nThe respondents differed in terms of the views they had been selected to represent and those they were seeking to represent (Appendix 5). Overall, although few respondents had been selected to represent the public at large, many respondents sought to do so (Table 11). This discrepancy was least pronounced in Quebec, but still represented a difference of more than 15 percentage points. There was also a notable difference in many regions between the proportions of committee members selected and seeking to represent their own views. This difference was particularly notable in British Columbia, where 21.5% of respondents had been selected to represent their own views but only 10.9% were seeking to do so.\n\nThe majority of respondents (>60%) in all regions felt that the committees represented the values of all interested parties; this sentiment was stronger in the Atlantic and Quebec regions (>80%) (Fig. 4). Overall, significantly fewer women than men agreed that all values were represented (68.7% versus 77.0%).\n\nOf the respondents who did not think that the committee represented the values of all interested and affected groups, 273 provided statements about who was not represented. The absence of Aboriginal or First Nations groups was mentioned by 31.1% of these respondents and the absence of environment and wildlife-oriented interests by 13.2%. In addition, recreation users, the general public (those representing more general interests rather than specific interests), tourism, the oil and gas industry, and youth were also thought to be unrepresented on some committees. Table 12 lists all of the unrepresented groups that were mentioned by at least one respondent.\n\nTable 10.

There were no significant differences among regions for the existence value related to the importance of maintaining forests for future generations, and over 95% of all respondents agreed with both statements about existence values (Table 13).\n\nThere were no differences among regions for one of the statements associated with spiritual values (Appendix 7): between 82.4% and 89.7% of respondents agreed with the statement that humans should have more respect and admiration for the forest. The spiritual values statement that forests are sacred places garnered the least agreement in this category (from 32.5% to 56.4%). Furthermore, significantly more women than men agreed with this statement (50.9% and 37.2%, respectively) (Fig. 5).\n\nThe inherent worth category produced significant variability among the regions (Appendix 8). Quebec had the lowest level of agreement that forests should have the right to exist for their own sake (47.6%) (Table 14), and there was a similar level of agreement among Ontario respondents (57.1%); in contrast, the proportion was 76.9% for respondents from the Prairies region. For the statement that wildlife, plants, and humans should have equal rights to live and develop, the level of agreement for Atlantic respondents (79.7) was higher than other regions with the next highest level of agreement from Prairie respondents (70.5%). The final statement in this category, that forests should be left to grow, develop, and succumb to natural forces, produced the least agreement (national average 22.9%).\n\nThe levels of agreement in Alberta and Quebec differed significantly for all six economic or utilitarian values statements, with Quebec respondents having a higher level of agreement in all cases (Appendix 9). There was a clear gradient of response from eastern Canada (higher agreement) to western Canada (lower agreement) for all statements in this category, but the differences were most significant for two of the statements: that forests should be managed to meet as many human needs as possible and that forests can be improved through management. Also, there were significant differences between men and women in their responses to most of the statements in this category, which indicates that women are more inclined to privilege natural processes over human interventions and human use values. For instance, 61.9% of women but only 46.3% of men disagreed with the statement that \"the primary function of forests should be for products and services that are useful to humans\" (Fig. 6).\n\nTable 12.

The most frequently identified source of pressure related to the complexity of the issue (see Table 15 for a summary and Appendix 10 for detailed information). This source of pressure was felt most acutely in Ontario, the Prairies, and British Columbia. Other sources of pressure to agree with decisions were felt less often, but time constraints and a lack of information contributed to feelings of discomfort for many respondents. Twenty percent of respondents from the Prairies region indicated that a lack of information contributed to a sense of pressure, whereas the national average for this source of pressure was 9.6%. With some variation as noted above, the responses across regions were relatively consistent and reflected similarities in the sources of pressure for advisory committees.\n\nThere was variability within and among regions in terms of respondents' views of who had control over setting the committee's agenda (Fig. 8). Industry was perceived to play a big role (ranging from 28.8% to 43.0%) except in Ontario, where only 8.4% of the respondents felt that industry was the most influential party in setting the meeting agenda. In that region, the provincial government was seen as the most influential (42.4%), which reflects the dominant role of the provincial government in sponsoring Ontario's committees. In Alberta (48.2%) and Quebec (38.1%), greater proportions of respondents indicated that it was the participants themselves who set the agenda. British Columbia was the only region where more respondents identified the facilitator (33.3%) as the most influential in setting the agenda. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 % of respondents Agree Neither Disagree Response to statement Women 0 5 % of respondents Atlantic Quebec Ontario Prairies Alberta British Columbia Canada Region Provincial government officials Industry The facilitator The participants Other\n\nTable 15.

In contrast, the forest industry (85.7%) and government agencies (76.3%) were the most often reported sources of information. Some regional differences in these results are notable. In the Atlantic region, 45.9% of respondents reported that the committees more often accessed information from firsthand visits to the forest, whereas only 18.9% percent of Quebec respondents did so. In addition, 68.5% of Alberta respondents reported that the committees more often accessed information from research scientists, whereas only 36.6% of Ontario respondents did so (Appendix 11).\n\nAlthough research scientists were not used as sources of information as often as the forest industry or government agencies (48.5%, 85.7%, and 76.3%, respectively; Table 16), they were perceived as the most accurate source of information about forests and forest management (30.7% overall) (Fig. 9). Respondents from the Atlantic region felt that first-hand visits to the forest represented a more accurate source of information than research scientists (20.2% versus 18.6%), and Ontario respondents felt that the forest industry was a more accurate source of information than research scientists (25.6% versus 19.2%). The proportions of respondents from Alberta (5.7%) and British Columbia (7.1%) who reported that government agencies were the most accurate source of information were notably lower than the national average (18.8%). Media or friends and family were considered the least accurate sources of information by respondents in all regions (Fig. 10).\n\nRespondents reported spending more time receiving information from the sponsor of the committee (35.0%) than receiving information from other sources (23.7%) (Fig. 11). More time was spent receiving information from the committee sponsors than on debate and discussion in the Atlantic (38.0% versus 35.0%) and Prairies (40.9% versus 34.6%) regions. Nationally, however, respondents spent more time on debate and discussion (37.4%) than on any other activity. See Appendix 12 for a breakdown of results by province and percentage of time spent on each task.\n\nThere was a high degree of agreement with various statements about learning and a positive outlook toward the learning aspects of the committee (Appendix 13). Overall, few respondents agreed with the statement that the information learned did not aid them in making forest management decisions (19.6%), but in British Columbia, the level of agreement with this statement was higher, at 30.6% (Table 17). The proportion of respondents who agreed with the statement that processes worked poorly when many different perspectives were represented was also lower than for the positive learning experiences, at 22.9%; in Quebec, the level of agreement with this statement was higher, at 31.5%.\n\nTable 16.

The proportion of respondents who felt positive about the committee after joining rose in all regions to a national average of 77.5% (Fig. 12). A greater proportion of Quebec respondents had a more positive feeling for the committee sponsor before being on the committee (49.8%) than was the case for respondents from the other regions. Similarly, a higher proportion of BC respondents indicated positive feelings before being on the committee (48.0%) but this figure did not increase to the same extent as in other regions after joining the committee (67.0%). In all regions, the proportion of respondents with a positive feeling for the sponsor rose from 49.0% before joining the committee to 67.0% after joining. In British Columbia, this increase was tempered, with 55.0% of respondents having positive feelings toward the sponsor after joining the committee. There were significant differences between men and women (p < 0.05), with 80.0% of men and 70.0% of women feeling positive about the committee after joining.\n\nAgreement with general statements related to the forest management process was greatest for the statement that the process was fair (72.0%). There were no statistically significant differences among regions for the statement that time was poorly spent in the process; on average, 22.7% of respondents agreed with this statement (Appendix 15).\n\nAgreement with statements related to the personal experience of respondents in the forest management process was highest for the statement that the respondent had been given adequate opportunity to voice concerns within the committee (88.5%), although a significantly lower number of women than men indicated this to be the case (74.0% versus 89.0%) (Appendix 15). This was also the highest level of agreement for any statement related to the forest management process. Agreement was lower for the statements that respondents were able to influence the decisions made by the committee (58.7%) and that the respondents' efforts were well spent (66.7%). For these statements, British Columbia respondents had the lowest levels of agreement (47.9% and 55.4%, respectively).\n\nAgreement with statements related to decision-making and learning was highest for the statement that the staff of the sponsoring organization provided answers to questions about forest management (83.7%). Only 58.4% of respondents, however, agreed with the statement that they trusted the information presented about the impacts of forest management plans (Appendix 15). There was also a lower level of agreement with the statement that decisions succeeded in accommodating a full spectrum of public interests (57.7%). Only 26.3% of respondents agreed that the committee's decisions are easy to implement. There was 57.2% agreement with the statement that the committee is effective at influencing local forest decision-making, but only 43.3% agreed that they trusted forest managers to make the right choices about forest management (Table 18). For both of these statements, the BC respondents had the lowest levels of agreement (43.8% and 28.0%, respectively).\n\nThe highest level of agreement for statements regarding the quality of group deliberation (Appendix 16) was with the statement that active discussion is encouraged (85.1%). There was also a high degree of agreement with the statements that participants are shown consideration for their effort (83.5%) and that the committee meetings are interactive and personal (79.9%). Agreement was least for the statements that attendance of regular members is sporadic, which means that time is spent covering old ground (24.3% nationally; variation among regions is illustrated in Figure 13), and that the addition of new members slows progress (33.8%). These two statements also had the highest proportion of respondents who chose a neutral response (21.6% and 29.0%, respectively).\n\nIn addition to these questions about the quality of group deliberation, respondents were asked if anything could be done to improve the effectiveness of the committee in which they participated. Of the 933 respondents who answered this question, 527 (56.5%) said \"yes\" and 577 provided information about how this could be achieved. These recommendations varied dramatically, from \"taking more field trips to see how things are done in the forest\" to \"the committee needs to be more independent from industry and should be funded by other means.\" In more general terms, however, most of the recommendations fell into three categories: inputs to group discussion (field trips, workshops, technical information in advance of meetings, more information from alternative sources, contributions from committee members)  representation on committee (adequate representation from locally affected groups, regular attendance, opportunities for all members to speak, more attention to local issues, term limits for members to encourage new ideas and perspectives) processes and procedures (independent and professional facilitator, improved consensus-building and decision-making processes, financial compensation for time on committee, more autonomy from committee sponsors, established procedures and guidelines, more binding decisions that directly influence policy and management practice) Although every committee has its own unique strengths and challenges, these general categories may be useful in exploring the ways in which advisory committees could become more effective as tools for public involvement in the forest management process.\n\nIn the final section of the questionnaire, respondents were asked about their level of satisfaction with various aspects of the committee and the process (Appendix 17). Overall levels of satisfaction were relatively high, particularly in Alberta (Fig. 14). With regard to more specific questions, satisfaction was highest for the quality of information provided for committee discussion (82.7%), with no statistically significant differences among regions for this statement. Respondents also indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the representativeness of the committee (79.2%) and the quality of discussion within the committee (79.7%). Regional variation was notable for these statements. For instance, BC respondents had the lowest degree of satisfaction with the representativeness of the committee (66.2%) and the quality of discussion (68.5%). The lowest degree of satisfaction nationally was for the decision-making process (67.2%); respondents from the Prairies region and British Columbia reported the least degree of satisfaction in this area (56.0% and 56.9%, respectively). Finally, aside from slightly more dissatisfaction among women with the quality of discussion, there were no notable differences in levels of satisfaction with committee processes between men and women. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 % of respondents Atlantic Quebec Ontario Prairies Alberta British Columbia Canada Region Before joining the committee After joining the committee\n\nTable 18.

In every region of the country, such committees have been constituted, with sponsorship from forest companies and provincial and local governments. In spite of the vast geographic distances between where committees are based and the very different political and social climates in which they function, there is a striking amount of consistency in the characteristics and functioning of committees and the issues represented by committee members from coast to coast. For instance, many of these committees are struggling to find ways of achieving consensus without compromising the interests and concerns of minority voices. The demographic characteristics of committee members were also consistent in terms of age, sex, and education. A substantial number of members who were selected to represent individual interests also reported seeking to represent the public at large. There was strong consistency in the reasons members gave for participating in such committees, the most important being a concern for the environment and a desire to make a contribution to forest planning. Many of the opinions expressed about group processes and functioning were consistent across the country. For instance, the forest industry was reported as a major source of information for committees in all regions, a high proportion of members considered the committee a place to learn about other perspectives on forest management, and there were relatively high levels of satisfaction with group processes in every region.\n\nThere were also some important differences in the composition and functioning of committees from coast to coast:\n\nCommittees in the Prairies region had the highest number of members on their mailing lists and they met less frequently than those in other regions of the country.\n\nQuebec committee members were much younger than members in other parts of the country, and almost 70% of respondents from Quebec were required to attend as a part of their job. Alberta committee members were more likely to access information from research scientists and they considered this information more accurate than did members from other provinces. BC committees had a larger proportion of women than committees in other regions, and the general level of satisfaction and feelings about the committee and the sponsor were less positive in British Columbia than in other regions of the country. Ontario committees had a higher proportion of members from hunting and fishing association than was the case in other regions. This was, in part, due to the origins of local citizen committees in Ontario.\n\nThe reporting framework for the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM 2003) identifies two indicators to measure the fairness and effectiveness of decision-making in forest management, one relating to compliance with provincial and federal laws and regulations and the other relating to satisfaction with public involvement processes. The CCFM also states that \"decision-makers [should] try to involve the public in the decision-making process in order to effectively incorporate the full range of social values into decisions and to be responsive to changes in values over time\" (CCFM 2003, page 19). The surveys reported here were conducted, in part, to provide national data for CCFM reporting purposes, and specific information toward this end appears within several sections of this report. Levels of satisfaction with various aspects of committee processes are contained within Appendix 17, and the results suggest, for instance, that the overall     level of satisfaction among committee members in British Columbia was significantly lower than in other regions. In addition to these satisfaction scores, several other aspects of the study provide insights into the issue of fair and effective decisionmaking as outlined below.\n\nAs discussed in the section titled \"Questionnaire Design,\" representation is a key area of interest for researchers because it relates to the diversity of public voices and the extent to which such voices are represented in committee processes. In many regions, the majority of committee members came from households that are dependent on a natural resource industry or agency for employment. In Quebec, many participants were required to attend committee meetings as part of their job. Advisory committee members were typically more educated and earned higher wages than members of the general public, and the proportion of men was higher than in the general public (see McFarlane and Boxall 2000;Hunt and McFarlane 2002 for comparisons with the general public). The data on forest values provide some insights into the range of values represented on advisory committees. There was considerable consistency across regions with regard to some values (such as existence values), but there were also some notable differences between eastern Canada and western Canada, particularly with regard to economic and utilitarian values (Appendix 9). Differences between male and female respondents were most significant for the forest values section of the survey; this has implications for the recommendations generated by the committees, especially given that women are underrepresented on many committees.\n\nIt would also be instructive to compare the forest values of advisory committee members with those of the general public. Although there is no national-level information on forest values among the general public that could be compared with the findings from this study, this type of analysis would be useful in determining the extent to which advisory committee members represent the general public. For example, McFarlane and Boxall (2000) reported a comparison of forest values between advisory committee members and members of the general public in Alberta, and Hunt and McFarlane (2002) reported a similar comparison for Ontario. The advisory committee members in both provinces tended to express more support for the human use of natural resources than did members of the general public.\n\nAs identified in the section on questionnaire design, researchers have recognized numerous process-related issues such as information sources, time constraints, opportunities for learning, and the use of professional facilitators that are germane to this topic. Although researchers generally agree that the use of professional facilitators can make an important contribution to the quality of committee processes (through the use of techniques for effective dialogue, by providing opportunities for quieter voices to be heard, and by allowing the committee to have some autonomy from the sponsoring agency), the use of professional facilitators is highly variable across the country (Table 6). The use of such facilitators appears to be more common in provinces such as Quebec and Alberta, but less common in the Atlantic region and Ontario.\n\nThe complexity of issues discussed was for many respondents the primary area of pressure to agree with decisions with which they were not completely comfortable (Appendix 10). Lack of information and time constraints also caused some sense of pressure. The section above describing the results of the survey of committee members provides some insights into the types of information that committee members are accessing and the information sources that are considered to be most accurate. It is also instructive to note the fairly consistent pattern of committee activity whereby members spent approximately 60% of their time passively, receiving information from various sources, and about 40% of their time in discussion and debate (Appendix 12).\n\nAlthough many factors contribute to the fairness and effectiveness of committee process, a general overview of these factors in the survey of committee members suggests that most members considered their own committee process to be fair and effective; 72.0% of respondents across the country agreed that the process in which they were involved was fair and 60.9% of respondents agreed that the process was effective (Appendix 15). This general consensus is tempered to some extent by weaknesses related to the lack of professional facilitation in some regions of the country. Also, there is some evidence that committee members were ambivalent about the effectiveness of committee processes. For instance, 58.4% of respondents trusted the information presented about impacts of forest management, but 41.7% were less sure (20.2% neither agreed nor disagreed and 21.5% disagreed). Similarly, sporadic attendance at meeting may be limiting the effectiveness of some committees (Appendix 16).\n\nAlong with the challenges associated with ensuring adequate representation of key constituents such as Aboriginal people, environmental groups, and recreation groups, numerous respondents mentioned the challenges associated with consensus-building processes. Among all the aspects of committee activity (Appendix 17), the decision-making process was thought to be the least satisfactory. This result is consistent with respondents' concerns about the challenges of reaching a consensus while attempting to respect dissension and minority perspectives. Along these lines, one committee member suggested that \"since we worked on consensus, there needs to be a fuller understanding of what that means and how someone can disagree and have that acknowledged.\" This perspective was expressed in different ways by many of the respondents. Many of the comments about improving the effectiveness of advisory committees also reflect this challenge. For instance, one respondent mentioned that \"committee members must see other interest [groups'] point of view and have room for sharing views…[we need fewer] negative people on the committee and training on consensus achievement.\" These comments reflect one of the core challenges in small groups that are characterized by a diversity of public values and that are charged with developing a shared understanding of issues.\n\nAlthough this study provides information about the fairness and effectiveness of public advisory committees in terms of reported levels of satisfaction and issues of representation, it is important to note that an assessment of this nature is an inherently difficult research endeavour, involving key assumptions or normative claims about what it means to have an effective public advisory process. It is natural to assume that practitioners and sponsors of advisory committees are interested in seeking efficient and harmonious group processes. For many groups, the initial years of activity tend to be more challenging in this regard, but as committee members become more familiar with the issues and develop a shared sense of understanding, group processes mature and the efficiency of those processes appears to improve. Some researchers, however, observe this evolution of group processes in a much different light. For these analysts, an effective public process is one that promotes and maintains a level of constructive discord among group members, which in turn fuels vigorous public dialogue on current resource management issues. In such committees a sense of shared understanding is slow in coming, and sponsoring agencies and decision-makers benefit from a local-level dialogue that reflects in some sense the larger debates within scientific circles and within civil society about the status of forest resources.\n\nResults from the advisory committee members in British Columbia provide a case in point. On the basis of results from this survey, one might be tempted to suggest that the BC committees are the least effective of all committees in Canada because the BC respondents reported higher levels of dissatisfaction with learning processes, were less positive about being on their respective committees, and were generally less satisfied with the overall process. From another point of view, higher levels of satisfaction in other regions may simply mean that dissatisfied members have been more efficiently dispatched from the committees in those regions or that the perspectives of committee members were more homogenous from the outset.\n\nIn both cases, the representation of a broad range of values is likely to be affected and the quality of dialogue and debate is likely to suffer.\n\nIf one goal of these committees is to bring a diversity of perspectives to the table, the fact that BC members and their committee processes are more discordant may mean that they are also more effective at bringing multiple points of view to bear on various issues. This perspective is supported by the fact that 21.5% of BC respondents had been selected to represent their own views (whereas the national average was 7.1%) (Appendix 5). This alternative approach to understanding the effectiveness of advisory committees tends to examine measures of fairness and effectiveness from a different perspective and complicates the analysis by exposing the normative claims behind many of the measures used to study public participation processes.\n\nThis study provides a baseline assessment of advisory committees in the Canadian forest sector. It also provides insights into several important aspects of effective group processes, including information on the extent to which committees provide opportunities for people with a wide range of knowledge and interests to contribute to committee discussions and to influence the decision-making process. It also provides some information on how the committees function, with insights into their sources of information, the perceived accuracy of various information sources, the time spent on various activities, the learning outcomes from group processes, and opinions about group processes such as consideration of controversial issues and satisfaction with the processes. These results provide some opportunities to comment on the challenges of incorporating a wide range of public interests in a small-scale process located primarily in rural and resourcebased communities. The study also points to challenges associated with consensus building, which appears to have been a key area of concern for survey respondents, one that could ultimately lead to improvements in committee processes.\n\nWith some variation across regions, evidence from this study suggests that the majority of advisory committee members who participated in this study were satisfied with their experience. It is important to note, however, that satisfaction surveys of this nature are inherently biased toward those who have decided to participate in such committees, which necessarily yields a more positive outlook than more in-depth research methods might reveal (e.g., case studies). Surveys of this nature do not provide insights into the individuals and organizations who do not see such committees as productive places for public dialogue and debate. Some respondents found the committees to be focused on public education rather than public dialogue. Others were frustrated by the lack of opportunity to meaningfully influence the decisionmaking process. In addition, other data gathered in the study provide insights about the deficiencies of public representation. A significant proportion of respondents expressed concerns about lack of representation of certain groups, chronic absences from committee meetings, and lack of opportunity for minority positions to be expressed and taken seriously.\n\nAlthough the advisory committee process in the forest sector has become a dominant method of public participation, many other methods are available. Open houses and public hearings represent more common approaches within the natural resource sector, but the social sciences offer a rich variety of alternative mechanisms, including citizen juries, deliberative polling, focus groups, random sample survey research, personal interviews, and participatory landscape visualization techniques.\n\nAll of these processes have their strengths and weaknesses, but they can be combined in creative ways to construct a well-balanced public participation program. For instance, Beckley et al. (2005) showed that advisory committees are effective in promoting open dialogue and adapting to new information as it becomes available, but they are less effective in providing opportunities for broadbased representation of public values. Conversely, surveys are effective for gaining information about public values but are less flexible and provide little opportunity for dialogue and learning. Other researchers have identified a range of possible public participation methods that may be appropriate at various points within the environmental planning context (Mitchell and Parkins 2005;Sinclair and Diduck 2005).\n\nIn light of the concerns about consensus building in particular, several suggestions are presented here as ways to improve this key process: Make use of a professional facilitator. Ideally, facilitators are independent from sponsoring agencies and will act as neutral players in committee meetings. Some key roles for facilitators are to provide consistency in group procedures, to prevent individuals or groups from dominating discussion, and to allow opportunities for minority voices to participate. Engage in training activities with a professional facilitator or an independent organization to improve procedures for consensus building and decision making within collaborative settings. Organizations such as the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2 2005) provide opportunities for training at their annual conferences. Given that the average age of committee members was 50 years (Table 9), consider ways of attracting more youth to the table. This might be accomplished through a youth sponsorship program or a designated chair for youth issues on the committee.\n\nGiven that female respondents held different forest values than their male counterparts, consider ways of building more female representation into committee processes. Working toward a balance of male and female committee members will lead to a more accurate representation of public values.\n\nIn the interests of fostering dialogue and maintaining contact with a wide range of local interests, find ways of extending advisory committee activities to the surrounding community. Presentations by local human service agencies, environmental organizations, and other government or nongovernment organizations represent important opportunities for dialogue and learning. Advisory committees may also act as sponsors of public sessions on local \"hot topics\" in the forest sector. Finally, term limits on membership and ways of bringing new members on board could be considered. Establish a national network of advisory committees for the purpose of learning from other committees and working on common challenges. The decentralized nature of advisory committees in the forest sector causes isolation from other committees that are working on similar issues and dealing with the same challenges. A network of such committees may provide opportunities for learning and sharing experiences. In addition to repeating the measurements made with these surveys, future research with advisory committees may involve experimenting with innovations in advisory committee activity. For instance, certain styles of group facilitation can foster group learning, development of common ground and a shared understanding of the issues. These experiments, especially if performed in conjunction with researchers, may lead to improvements in advisory committee processes and greater integration of public interests and public knowledge into forest planning. In 2003, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers introduced a revised set of Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management. Within this new framework, a core indicator deals with fair and effective decision making and participant satisfaction with public involvement processes. This survey will assist in reporting on this indicator.
