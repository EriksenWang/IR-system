    "full_text": "A tagging project was initiated in 1987 to examine variability in population dynamics. The 1992 studies based on this tagged population support past findings that there is a tendency for males to be resighted near their natal rookery; that the date of first sighting is significantly related to age (P < 0.001) (older males arrive earlier in the season than younger ones); and a significant relationship exists between male pup weight and weight at age 2 (P = 0.001, n = 20) and age 3 (P = 0.006, n = 8l), but not at age 4 (P = 0.07, n = 78) or age 5 (P = 0.18, n = 15).\n\nThe estimated incidence of entanglement in net debris among female fur seals on St. Paul Island was 0.062% for 1991 and 0.036% for 1992 with a 2-year mean of 0.046%. This is a reduced level of entanglement compared with a similar study in 1985 which showed entanglement rates of 0.06%-0.23% and a mean of 0.14%.\n\nThe 'proportion of juvenile males observed entangled in 1992 was 0.29%. The frequency of occurrence of trawl webbing among entangling debris in 1992 was about one-half that observed prior to 1988. The proportion of seals entangled in other types of debris did not change. The 1992 studies on male entanglement confirm earlier estimates that the annual survival of seals entangled in small debris is about one-half that of nonentangled seals. Seals from which debris was removed had significantly (P < . 05) higher survival rates than those which remained entangled.\n\nIsland was 72 on 8 July. Live pup counts on 29 July and 5 August totaled 1,124 and 965, respectively. On 11 August, 274 dead pups were counted. One hundred and fifty pups were tagged on 27 September and another 150 were tagged on 1 November. Mean pup weights for 1992 were significantly lower (P < .OOl) than mean pup weights for all non-El Niño years between 1977 and 1991, but significantly greater (P < . 001)Pthan those of the El Niño years of 1976 and 1983. This indicates that while the health of preweaned pups was compromised during the 1991-1992 El Niño, it was not as detrimental as previous warm water events.

Bogoslof Island (53°56'N lat., 168°O2'W long.) in the southern Bering Sea. Two pups were first observed there in 1980 (Lloyd et al. 1981) and by 1992 the rookery had grown to at least 183 pups and 295 adult females (1,473 total animals) (Baker andKiyota 1992, Loughlin andMiller 1989). Northern fur seals temporarily haul out on land at other sites in Alaska and British Columbia, and on islets along the coast of the continental United States, but generally not during the breeding season (Fiscus 1983).\n\nThere is significant interchange among the various breeding groups so they are considered components of a single species.\n\nBased on geographic separation, we recommend that the San Miguel and Pribilof Island's stocks be considered separate.\n\nWorld-wide, northern fur seals occur from southern California north to the Bering Sea and west to the Okhotsk Sea and Honshu Island, Japan (Fig. 6). During the breeding season approximately 72% of all fur seals world-wide can be found on the Pribilof Islands, 19% can be found on the Commander Islands in the western Bering Sea' (Russia), 4% are on Robben Island in the Okhotsk Sea (Russia), <2% are on the Kuri1 Islands in the western North Pacific Ocean, and <l% are on San Miguel Island and Bogoslof Island (Lander and Kajimura 1982) . The estimated sizes of these populations in 1979 and 1992 are given in Table,2.\n\nIt is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the fur seal population because the estimation procedures are conducted while the seals are on land and at any given time some portion of the population is at sea. It is widely accepted that the best index of population trends is the number of pups born. Pups are counted in the middle of the breeding season after most pups are born and still on land. Pups comprise roughly 20%-30% of the total population (Fowler l985a) depending on the population's age structure (as determined by reproductive rates and mortality).\n\nVarious techniques were used to derive estimates of pup births including tagging, aerial photography, and counts of sample rookeries (Kenyon et al. 1954). Since 1962, pup production has been estimated using a mark-recapture technique called shearing-sampling (Chapman 1964, Chapman andJohnson 1968). From 1980 to 1989, the method was modified to subsample\n\nTable 2.--Estimated sizes of the northern fur seal stocks in 1979 and 1492. Number of pups born are shown in (). Vladimirov (1992).\n\nRussian estimates are from several of the 14 rookeries on St. Paul Island and to derive a total population (all age groups) estimate based on the ratio of pups to adult males (York and Kozloff 1987). However, due to the increase in the number 'of adult males following cessation of the commercial harvest of males in 1984, the ratio of adult males to pups became quite variable. This variability led to an imprecision in the shearing-sampling technique with subsampled rookeries (note the large confidence intervals for the 1989 estimate in Fig. 7). As a result, a new procedure was initiated in 1990 whereby all rookeries on both islands are censused every other year.\n\nAdult males have been counted annually since 1911 to measure the recruitment of breeding males and general population trends . Two categories of males, harem and idle, have been recorded for each year. For purposes of consistency in data, a harem male is defined in this text as one that is defending a territory containing one or more females. Idle males are usually about 7 years of age or older and may have territories but never with females. Between 1980 and 1992, the male counts were used to calculate estimates of pup production based on the' relationship between the number of territorial males and parturient females with pups (York and Kozloff 1987). The male counts are usually made in mid-July (l0-25 July) when most of the females have arrived and have given birth.      Alaska, 1911Alaska, -1992. The 1992 count was 1,834 seals.\n\nEstimates of the number of pups born on the Pribilof Islands are listed in ).  1981). After the cessation of the female harvest, pup births appeared to increase (in the early 197Os), but then decreased at 4%-S% per year from 1976 to 1981 or 1982 (York and Kozloff 1987).\n\nNo significant increase or decrease has occurred since then, based on combined Pribilof Islands counts, although pup births on St. George Island continued to decrease through the 1980s (York 1987b, Ream et al., Chapter 5, this volume).\n\nThe number of males counted at St. -Paul and St. George Islands is depicted in Figures 8-11 for the period 1911-1992. For 1992, the total number of males counted was 19,262. This total is based on harem and idle male counts at St. Paul Island of 5,460 and 10,940, respectively, and harem and idle male counts at St. George Island of 1,028 and 1,834, respectively. From 1956 to 1968 the total Pribilof Island stock declined as a result of the female harvest. Following the termination of *Includes 10,000 pups born on Sea Lion Rock from a 1990 estimate.\n\nthe female harvest in 1968, the stock increased between 1970 and 1976. In 1974, the stock was estimated to be 1.25 million fur seals with about 326,000 pups born on both Pribilof Islands (Lander 1981). After 1976, the stock abundance began to decline again along with a decline in pup production (York 1987b) resulting in a total stock estimate in 1983 of 877,000 fur seals (Briggs and Fowler 1984). As mentioned above, the, number of pups born on the Pribilof Islands did not change significantly from 1981 to 1988, suggesting that the total stock size had not changed (York 1987b;York and Fowler 1992).\n\nWe used recent estimates of pup births on the Pribilof Islands and annual male counts to obtain an estimate of the stock size for 1992. Applying these counts to the algorithm presented in Kozloff et al. (1985), and adjusted to remove harvest mortality of males (Table 4), we estimated the Pribilof Islands' northern fur seal population stock size to be 982,000 in 1992.\n\nThe fur seal population on San Miguel Island has slowly increased since its discovery in 1968 (Fig. 12).\n\nCounts of fur seals at Adams Cove on San Miguel Island in 1992 included a maximum of 72 territorial males, of which 59 had females. The minimum number of pups born at Adams Cove was estimated at 1,239 and 598 were estimated for Castle Rock. These estimates are based on live pup counts in early August at both rookeries and a dead pup count at Adams Cove (n = 274). Dead pup counts were estimated at Castle Rock assuming the same mortality rate as Adams Cove (22% Table 4.--Information used to calculate the 1992 Pribilof Island stock size using the life table reported by Lander (1981), mortality.\n\nand adjusted for lack of harvest Estimates of the standard deviations are based only on the estimated standard deviations for numbers of pups, and not on any standard deviations for the life table, nor do they account for year-to-year variations in survival rates.\n\na 1989 represents the mean of the 1990 and l988 estimates.\n\nThe rate of juvenile fur seal mortality on land is density dependent and higher at high population levels than at low population levels. The juvenile mortality rate on St. George Island is lower than on St. Paul Island (York 1985c). Since the late 197Os, mortality rates of pups up to 4 months of age have been less than 10% on the Pribilof Islands, although historically they have been as high as 20%. During the first 2 years of life, mortality may be 60%-80% (Keyes 1965, Lander 1981, Fowler 1985a, York 1987c). Males have a higher mortality rate than females after 2 years of age, particularly after 7 years of age when males begin defending territories (Lander and Kajimura 1982).\n\nSurvival of adult females remains high (>80%) until age 14, after which it decreases to about 30% by age 19 (Smith and Polacheck 1981).\n\nAll indications suggest that the Pribilof Island population is below its carrying capacity (K), therefore a positive growth rate is expected. Yet, from 1976 to 1981, the St. Paul Island population declined approximately 7.8% per year and St. George Island fur seal numbers declined at 5%-6% per year (York 198733).\n\nMany possible causes (entanglement, diet, disease) for the decline have been considered (Sinclair et al. 1994, Fowler 1985a, National Marine Fisheries Service 1993), yet no clear explanation exists. Likewise, why the decline ended on St. Paul Island and persisted on St. George Island is not understood.\n\nThe birth rate of fur seals on Point Bennett, San Miguel Island, and on Castle Rock increased about 24% annually from 1972 through 1982, then decreased by 63 % in 1983 due to a significant El Niño event (DeLong and Antonelis 1991). Birth rates remained low through 1986 resulting in about 50% fewer births in 1984 and 1985 than in 1982; the number of births increased in 1986, but there were still 30% fewer pups born than in 1982 (DeLong and Antonelis 1991). No detailed information is available from Bogoslof Island, but counts of the entire population indicate that the colony is continuing to grow. Stock Status Relative to Optimum Sustainable Population and Carrying Capacity Growth Rate at Maximum Net Productivity Level\n\nBased on empirical information for northern fur seals (Smith 1973) and interspecific comparisons (Fowler 1984a), maximum net productivity level is estimated. to occur at approximately 60% of carrying capacity (K). Ragen (1992) presented frequency distributions for the number of pups born at MNPL. Based on these distributions, Ragen concluded that the current population level (producing approximately 200,000 pups) is very likely below MNPL.\n\nOSP is defined as the range of population levels between MNPL and K. Ragen (1992) conducted a simulation analysis using numerous combinations of estimated values for fur seal population parameters which yielded frequency distributions for MNPL with modal values at approximately 65% of K. His analyses yielded frequency distributions rather than point estimates which reflected the uncertainty in life table values and densitydependent mechanisms influencing the growth of the fur seal population on the Pribilof Islands.\n\nIt is assumed that northern fur seals were at their carrying capacity when the population was relatively stable and at historically high levels (1940s and 1950s). It is also assumed that the mean populationlevel for this period represented the carrying capacity of the Pribilof Island stock.\n\nThe MMPA defines a species, population, or stock as depleted if it falls below optimum sustainable population (OSP). As discussed above, the lower bound of OSP for northern fur seals is thought to be at least 60% of K. The Pribilof Islands population was designated as depleted under the MMPA in 1988 because it declined to less than 50% of levels observed in the late 1950s and there was no compelling evidence that carrying capacity had changed substantially since the late 1950s (Department of Commerce 1988).\n\nThe percentage declines of several population parameters were presented by the National Marine Fisheries Service (1993) and are updated in Table 5. There has been a recent increase in the number of adult males on St. Paul Island, which reflects the cessation of the harvest of juvenile males in 1984 (York and Fowler 1992). Adult males which would have otherwise been killed Table 6. --Date, location, and number of subadult male seals killed in subsistence harvest drives on St. Paul Island, Alaska, in 1992. * Includes Vostochni and Morjovi rookeries  York and Kozloff (1987) and Antonelis (1992).\n\nA census was not conducted on Little Polovina because the number of pups born there has declined precipitously since 1980, and any disturbance to the rookery was considered inadvisable.  Table 9.--Total number of northern fur seal pups sheared, number of sheared pups resighted on two sampling occasions (Rl and R2 The number of pups born on St. George Island was also estimated from a shearing-sampling study conducted on all rookeries. The most recent estimate of pup production prior to this study was obtained in 1990. From 12 to 13 August, a total of 2,332 pups were shear-marked on St. George Island. These marks were allocated proportionally on all rookeries according to the fraction of harem bulls counted in 1992. The ratio of marked to unmarked pups on each rookery was determined by two researchers on two occasions: once from 14 to 15 August, and again from 16 to 17 August. A summary by rookery of the number of pups sheared, sampling data, and the estimated mean number of pups alive at the time of marking is given in Table 11. Counts of dead pups were made from 14 to 15 August 1992. The ratio of marked to unmarked pups and the estimate of the number alive was calculated in the same manner as described for St. Paul Island.\n\nThe estimated number of pups born, dead pups, counts of breeding bulls, and ratios of pups to harem bulls for all rookeries on St.\n\nGeorge Island are summarized in Table 12.\n\nThe estimated total number of pups alive on St. George Island at the time of marking was 24,354 (SD = 707). The total number of dead pups was 806 and the mortality rate for late August was 3.20%. The total number of pups born on St. George Island and\n\nTable 11 .--Number of pups sheared, number of sheared pups resighted on two sampling occasions (Rl and R2), total number sampled on two sampling occasions (Tl and T2). number of pups estimated to be alive at the time of marking (El and E2), mean number alive (Mean) and standard deviation (SD), for all rookeries, St. George Island, Alaska, 1992.\n\nTable 12.--Number of pups alive at the time of marking, its standard deviation (SD), numbers of dead pups, total pups born, mortality rate, idle males, harem males, end ratio of pups alive at marking to harem males, St. George Island, Alaska, 1992. the approximate 95% confidence interval was 25,160 + (2.447 X 707), or 25,160 + 1,730. This count is not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the 23,397 pups observed on St. George Island in 1990, nor is it significantly different (P > 0.05) from the predicted number of pups born based on a regression fitted to the 1973-90 data, which showed a 5.7% decline (19,942 + 2,549; cf York 1990). Estimates and 95% confidence intervals of numbers of pups born on St. George Island for 1970-90 are shown in Figure 16.\n\nThe number of pups born and the number of harem males on St. George Island rookeries are highly correlated (Fig. 17).\n\nWhen the number of pups born are regressed on the number of, males, the value of R 2 is about 0.97. The intercept of the regression line is not significantly different from zero (P > 0.05) and was not included in the regression equation; the slope of the regression line is 24.16.\n\nThe rookeries and adjacent beaches of St. Paul and St.\n\nGeorge Islands (except Little Polovina) were surveyed for dead fur seals older than pups during July and August 1992. In 1992, tooth samples were collected from a total of 362 (97 males and 265 females) and 26 (7 males and 19 females) animals found dead on St. Paul and St. George Islands, respectively (Table 13).\n\nTooth samples (usually canines) were collected from all dead fur seals other than pups whenever possible. Appendix Table B-5 summarizes the total number of dead male and female fur seals from which teeth were collected from 1965 to 1992.  (Antonelis et al. 1992).\n\nA monel cattle ear tag with a rounded post was attached to each foreflipper, approximately 1.0 cm to the distal side of the hairline, and 1.7 cm from the posterior edge of the flipper.\n\nWeights were collected from at least 10% of the pups handled from each rookery. Pups were randomly selected for weighing. The minimum number of pups to be weighed at any rookery was 100.\n\nPups were weighed by placing the animal head-first into a weighing bucket or net which was suspended by hand from a spring scale. All weights were measured to the nearest 0.25 kg.\n\nMost resights of juvenile male seals occurred during roundups (Fowler andRagen 1990, Antonelis 1992). During this procedure, seals judged to be of the size historically taken in the commercial harvest (approximately 105 cm to 125 cm total length) are counted on haul outs where juvenile males congregate during the breeding season. Some individuals are seen on more than one occasion during the roundups. A few tagged seals are either resighted or killed in the subsistence harvest on St. Paul and St. George Islands. For comparison of resight data with rookeries where tags were applied, the various haul outs were assigned to the nearest rookery. In a few cases, the assignment of haul outs to associated rookeries was somewhat arbitrary. For example, a hauling. ground between Little Zapadni and Zapadni rookeries (referred to as Zapadni Sands) could be assigned to either rookery. Here it is assigned to Zapadni rookery, in view of location and movement of, seals onto areas more clearly associated with this rookery. The very tip of Northeast Point is between the Vostochni and Morjovi rookeries, but it was designated as part of Morjovi.\n\nData recorded during recaptures included the tag number, tag condition, presence or absence of a tag on both flippers, and condition of the flippers at the site of tag attachment., Seals were caught with a noose pole and physically restrained using a restraint board and procedures described in Gentry and Holt (1982). A nylon harness was used to suspend the restraint board and seal from a digital suspension scale, which was attached to a metal pipe held by two workers while the weight was read. Weight values were recorded to the nearest 1 lb, and then converted to kilograms. The weight of the restraint board was subtracted from the total to determine the weight of each seal.\n\nIn 1992, several captures were made using a hoop net mounted on a handle. This method was often used to capture and hold a second tagged seal while the first was being held on the restraint board., thus speeding up the roundup and reducing stress on the animals. The net was also often selectively used for larger seals which were more difficult to handle with a noose pole and restraint board. Seals were weighed in the net by suspending it from the same scale used with the restraint board.\n\nThe weight of the net was subtracted from the total to determine the weight of each seal: Tagged seals killed during the subsistence harvest were weighed on a platform scale.\n\nTag Resights RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The number of northern fur seal pups tagged on St. Paul Island from 1987 to 1990 are listed in Table 14 by sex and rookery. Pups were never tagged on Little Polovina rookery during this study, and none were tagged on Ardiguen rookery in 1987. Roundups of male northern fur seals were completed on St. Paul Island during July and early August of 1992 (see Table 27, Fowler et al., Chapter 8, this volume). During roundups, 17,630 male seals judged to be of the size historically taken in the commercial harvest were observed. A total of 622 seals with monel tags were resighted, 17.5% (n = 109) of which were resighted at least twice. This is lower than the multiple resight rates observed in 1991 (23.9%, Baker et al. 1993) and 1990 (23.6%, Antonelis et al. 1992). Of the total, 82.5%\n\n(n = 513) were seen only once, 15.1% (n = 94) were seen twice, 2.1% (n = 13) three times, and 0.3% (n = 2) four times.\n\nSeventeen monel-tagged seals were killed in the subsistence harvest: five 2-year-olds, eleven 3-year-olds, and one 4-yearold.\n\nOf the monel-tagged seals resighted in 1992, including those killed in the subsistence harvest, 81 (13%) were 5-year-olds, 200 (32.2%) were 4-year-olds, 273 (43.9%) were 3-year-olds, and 68 (10.9%) were 2-year-olds. The accumulation of these totals (using only the first resighting) over the season are illustrated in Figure 18, which shows that most of the 2-year-old seals were\n\nTable 14. --Range and number of monel tags applied to northern fur seal pups on St. Paul Island rookeries, 1987-1990. Total number tagged for a given rookery includes males, females, and any pups whose sex was not recorded.\n\nTable 14.--Continued. resighted late in the series of roundups, while most 5-year-olds were seen early. A list of monel-tagged fur seals resighted / during roundups and the subsistence harvest in 1992 is presented in Appendix Table B-6.\n\nThe distribution of rookery of resighting compared with the rookery of tagging is presented for 2-through 5-year-olds in Tables 15-18, respectively. These tables include all multiple sightings. for seals seen in 1992 and are arranged with the rookeries listed in clockwise order for St. Paul Island, starting with Vostochni rookery. Thus, the nearest rookeries are adjacent to each other in the table. The tendency for individuals to be resighted at their natal rookery is apparent from the larger numbers along the diagonal axis of the tables. This is especially apparent for the large samples of 3-and 4-year-olds.\n\nTable 19 summarizes the numbers of seals with missing tags.\n\nThe higher rate of tag loss noted previously (Baker et al. 1993) for seals tagged in 1987 compared with those tagged in later years was still evident in 1992. Estimated double tag loss at age 4 was 5.03% for the 1987 cohort (Baker et al. 1993) compared with only 1.30% for the 1988 cohort.\n\nA total-of 587 juvenile males were weighed during 1992. A summary of weight data for juvenile males captured during 1990-1992 is presented in Table 20. Since there is a preference for smaller seals in the Aleut native subsistence harvest, weight measurements taken during this harvest were not used in calculations presented in Table 20. Only weights taken during the roundups were used. Also, if a seal was weighed more than once in a season, the mean of all weights was used.\n\nA one-way analysis of variance indicated no difference between mean weights of 2-year-olds weighed each summer from 1990\n\nto 1992 (i.e., 1988-90 cohorts, P = 0.96). There were significant differences between mean weights at age 3 among the 1987-89 cohorts (P = 0.001). Multiple comparisons using the Student-Newman-Keuls test showed that 3-year-olds in 1990 (1987 cohort) weighed significantly less than those from both 1991\n\n(1988 cohort, P < 0.05) and 1992 (1989 cohort, P < 0.001).\n\nThere was no difference between the mean weights of 3-year-olds weighed in 1991 and 1992 (P > 0.05). Finally, a two-sample t-test showed that 4-year-olds from the 1987 cohort weighed significantly less than the 1988 cohort (P = 0.016).\n\nFigure 19 shows the weight distribution of 2-through 5year-olds.\n\nThe weight distributions of the age groups overlapped a great deal; for example, some 3-year-olds weighed more than some 5-year-olds. The lightest 5-year-old (tag number A07073)\n\nwas entangled in a piece of twine which was very tight and had opened a wound which extended three-quarters of the way around his neck.' He weighed less (25.8 kg) than one-half the average for his age and less than the largest a-year-old (27.2 kg). It seems certain that the severe entanglement caused the seal to become both emaciated and stunted.\n\nDuring 1992, we handled 5-year-old males on a regular basis for the first time. We suspect that the 5-year-olds weighed in the roundups are not representative of the age group as a whole, and the mean weights of 5 year-olds (Table 20) are probably an underestimate.\n\nFor example, because the proportion of adult and near-adult sized males has dramatically increased on the haul outs in recent years (Fowler and Sinclair 1993), we often attempt to round up groups of mostly smaller sub-adult males, -a procedure which may exclude the largest 5-year-olds. Also, these large 5-year-olds may haul out in association with adult males in areas such as rookery peripheries which we generally avoid so as not to disturb breeding seals and pups. In one case, a very large 5-year-old was captured but not weighed because he seemed too strong to be handled safely. These concerns must-be considered when interpreting any analysis of 5-year-olds' weights.\n\nConsistent with results from previous analyses (Antonelis et al. 1992, Baker et al. 1993), variation in date of juvenile males' arrival on St. Paul Island in 1992 was associated more with age than with weight. Regression analysis showed that date of first sighting of monel-tagged seals is significantly related to age (P < O.OOl), as older animals tend to be sighted earlier (Fig. 18). A multiple-regression analysis of date of first sighting using age and weight at first capture as independent variables indicated a significant interaction (age X weight, P = <O.OOl). Regression analyses of date of first sighting on weight were then conducted for each age group separately. Date of first sighting and weight were significantly positively correlated for 4-and 5-year-olds (P = 0.022 and P.= 0.051, respectively). The estimated slope. remained unchanged but the Pvalue rose to 0.079 when the emaciated 5-year-old entangled in net debris was removed from the analysis. There was no significant relationship between date and weight for the 2-and 3-year-olds, although the estimated slopes were positive.\n\nTo summarize, older animals show a strong tendency to arrive earlier, and since weight increases with age, heavier/older animals are seen earlier. However, within age classes the opposite trend may occur, whereby those 4-and 5-year-olds first captured later in the season tend to weigh more for their age. A likely explanation is that those who arrive later spend more time feeding and consequently weigh more when they haul out. A related question pertains to the proportion of time seals spend ashore once they have returned to the island. If different size or age groups of males spend different proportions of time ashore, they should also have different capture probabilities during roundups. To investigate the possible effect of body size and age on probability of capture, we analyzed the capture histories of tagged males during 1992. The mean weight of all captures was used for each seal caught more than once.\n\nRegression analysis showed no significant relationship between either weight or age and the number of times a seal was seen.\n\nThis suggests that there was no significant difference in the proportion of time juvenile males spent ashore according to weight or age.\n\nWeights of seals which were captured more than once during the season were strikingly variable, and distinct trends in this variability which have been identified previously (Antonelis et al. 1992, Baker et al. 1993) were observed again. from age 4 to 5 was 39.7% (s = 16.0%, range -11.2% to 75.1%):'\n\nFigure 22 plots the change in individuals' weight by age.\n\nRegression analysis showed significant relationships-between weight at age 5 and age 4 (P < 0.001, n = 39), age 4 and age three (P < 0.001, n = 66), and between weight at age 3 and age 2 (P = 0.03, n = 13). WEIGHTS OF KNOWN-AGE SUBADULT MALE NORTHERN FUR SEALS TAKEN IN THE ST. PAUL ISLAND SUBSISTENCE HARVEST, 1991-1992 M. Bradley Hanson, Jason D. Baker, and George A. Antonelis Considerable variation exists in the weights of each class of subadult male fur seal (Fowler et al., Ch. 3, this volume). Total body weight and age of subadult male northern fur seals killed during the subsistence harvests on St. Paul Island were compared with those of roundup animals to determine whether the weights of the harvested seals were representative of their age groups. If the weight of harvested seals are representative of their age groups, these data could be used to increase the sample size of studies of known-age animals. Subadult males were sampled opportunistically during the 1991 and 1992 subsistence harvests. Immediately following death, each seal was weighed to the nearest 0.1 lb (converted to kilograms) and the upper snout removed for extraction of the canine teeth (Antonelis 1992). To estimate ages, the number of annual dentin layers were counted from whole teeth following the methods of Scheffer (1950). Weights and ages were determined for 12.2% (n = 201) and 18.1% (n = 269) of the subadult males killed during subsistence harvests in 1991 and 1992, respectively (\n\nTable 21). The proportion of each age group sampled from the harvest was similar for both years. As reported in Fowler et al. (Ch. 3, this volume) 2-, 3-, Table 21. --Weights of subadult northern fur seals taken in the subsistence harvest on St. Paul Island, Alaska, 1991-1992. and 4-year-olds weighed, an average of 21.6 kg, 28.9 kg, and 38.9 kg, respectively, in the 1991 roundups, and 21.7 kg, 29.4 kg, and 40.3 kg in 1992.\n\nWe conducted an analysis of variance with weight as the response variable,. and year (1991 or 1992), age (2 -4 years old), sampling method (harvest or roundup), and all possible interactions as independent variables. There was a significant interaction between age and sampling method (P< 0.0001) because the difference between weights of harvested and roundup seals varied with age (Fig. 23). Consequently, the effects of year and sampling method were analyzed for each age group separately.\n\nAmong 2-year-olds, there was no significant difference between the weights of males killed in the harvest or weighed during roundups (P = 0.39). However, harvested 3-and 4-year-old seals weighed significantly less than roundup seals for both ages (P < 0.0001). Small seals the size of an average 2 year-old are preferentially selected in the St. Paul Island subsistence harvest. When 3-and 4-year-olds were killed (mainly during the first half of the harvest before large numbers of 2-year-olds are available), they tended to be small for their age. Therefore, weight data collected from the subsistence 'harvest probably represents 2-year-olds as accurately as data from roundups, but weights of harvested 3-and 4-year-olds are probably biased.\n\nWe examined the weights of seals killed in the subsistence harvest to determine whether there were differences between 1991 and 1992. Two-year-olds harvested-in 1991 weighed significantly less than those harvested in 1992 (P = 0.033). Weights of 3-and TRENDS IN PUP PRODUCTION OF ROOKERIES ON ST. GEORGE ISLAND, ALASKA by Rolf R. Ream, George A. Antonelis, and Jason D. Baker Since 1912, northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), pup production has been estimated to indicate trends in population growth on St. Paul and St. George Islands, Alaska. Based on the number of pups born, the St. Paul Island population exhibited a rate of decline similar to that of St. George Island from 1966 to the early 1980s but has since shown no downward trend (York 1990). St. George Island, on the other hand, continued to decline throughout the 1980s (York 1990). In this study, we examine the decline on St. George Island by 1) describing historical trends in numbers of pups born since 1914, 2) evaluating the contribution of individual rookeries to the total island pup production over time, and 3) comparing rates of change in pup production at each rookery.\n\nIsland were compiled from Lander (1980) and annual Fur Seal Investigations. From 1914 to 1916, and in 1922, these estimates were obtained by direct counts. The next reliable estimates were made in 1966, the first year the shear-sampling method (York and Kozloff 1987) was used on St. George Island. This technique was used in all subsequent years that pup production estimates were obtained on St; George Island. We calculated the percent contribution of each rookery to the island total pup production for each year (between 1914 and 1992) that pup production estimates were obtained for all rookeries. Average annual growth rates of different rookeries were examined for the years 1966-92 using linear regression of the natural log of pup production by year. Separate slopes and intercepts were first fitted for each rookery. Slopes for rookeries which did not differ significantly were then combined. Two periods, 1966-1981 and 1981-1992, were also analyzed separately in order to investigate average annual growth rates of different rookeries when St. George and St. Paul Islands had similar rates of decline (1966-81), and when St. George Island continued to decline while St. Paul Island showed no-trend (1981-92). RESULTS From 1914 to 1966, pup production on St. George Island increased by 55,564 (from 13,867 to 69,431) (Fig. 24). This 400.7% increase may be misleading because of the lack of data between 1922 and 1966, when the annual numbers of pups born may have been greater than the 1966 estimate. After 1966, the number of pups born dropped dramatically. The 1992 estimate of 25,160 pups (Antonelis et al., chapter 6, this volume) was 36.2% of the 1966 estimate. The relative contribution of individual rookeries to total pup production on St. George Island has changed over the years (Fig. 25). The number of pups on Staraya Artil rookery declined from 30.9% of the pups born in 1914 to 18% in 1970 and 8.0% in 1992. South rookery, in contrast, has gone from 0% contribution in 1914 to 16.8% of the pups born in 1992. Zapadni rookery also increased from a low of 3.3% in 1922 to 15.2% in 1992. North, East Cliffs, and East Reef rookeries showed distinct changes during short time intervals; however, over time, their approximate levels of contribution were maintained. Since 1981, notable trends occurred on East Cliffs, East Reef, and Zapadni. East Reef, for example, fell from 8.5% of the pups born in 1981 to 2.8% in 1988.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1992, Staraya Artil (P = 0.001) and East Reef (P = 0.023) rookeries showed rates of change that were significantly different from all other rookeries (Fig. 26a).\n\nOver this period, the average annual rate of growth was -6.7% for Staraya Artil and -5.8% for East Reef. The rest of the rookeries together declined at an average annual rate of 3.9% (Fig. 26a).\n\nDuring 1966 to 1981, East Reef was the only rookery that exhibited a positive annual rate of growth. At l.O%, this rate was significantly different (P < 0.001) from all other rookeries which averaged -3.9% growth per year (Fig. 26b). From 1981 to 1992, the average annual rate of growth of Staraya Artil (P = 0.016) and East Reef (P < 0.001) were again significantly different than all other rookeries. The average annual rate of growth was -7.1% for Staraya Artil and -13.4% for East Reef. All other rookeries together grew at -2.4% per year from 1981 to 1992 (Fig. 26c). DISCUSSION After considerable growth during the first half of this century, pup production on St. George Island dropped dramatically. The decline was probably precipitated by an extensive harvest of females from 1956 to 1968 on the Pribilof Islands (York and Hartley 1981). However, the female harvest can not explain the continued decline of the St. George Island population, especially throughout the 198Os, while pup production on St. Paul Island seems to have stabilized. In addition to between-island differences, individual rookeries on St. George Island have shown independent trends at various times. The relative contribution to the total Pribilof Island pup production by individual rookeries has changed. Most notably, the relative contribution of South and Zapadni rookeries increased while Staraya Artil's contribution decreased. Furthermore, rates of growth of rookeries on St. George Island differed. Staraya Artil and East Reef declined more rapidly than the other rookeries from 1966 to 1992, and in particular during the period from 1981 to 1992. The trends observed on St. George Island suggest differential survival or reproductive success of rookery populations, redistribution of females onto different rookeries or islands, or both. The factors responsible for the trends observed are unclear at this time. Researchers are currently investigating disease and mortality, foraging behavior, and noise This circumstantial evidence is worthy of additional research.\n\nIt is important to identify factors contributing to the decline so that appropriate mitigating actions can be taken for protection of rapidly declining rookery areas.\n\nn = 1,064), and other authors have reported a possible male bias on the Pribilof Islands (Huber in press;York andAntonelis 1990a, 1990b;and York and Towel1 1993). However, none included both live and dead pups in the assessment of the secondary sex ratio.\n\nIn this study, we evaluate the sex ratio of northern fur seal pups from data collected in 1989 and 1992 on the Pribilof released (Antonelis 1992). Approximately 2%-4% of the total pups born were sampled on each rookery, but the sample size was never fewer than 100.\n\nLog-likelihood G-tests and a heterogeneity analysis were used to determine if the sex ratio differed for live and dead pups (or if differences occurred between islands or years?) and to determine if the data sets (each year and island) were homogeneous (Zar 1984). A log-likelihood G-test was also used to determine if the pooled sex ratio was different than 50:50 (Zar 1984).\n\nThe sex ratio of live and dead pups born on St. Paul Island (Table 22)  Table 22 .--Secondary sex ratio comparisons of live and dead northern fur seal pups born on St. Paul Island and St. George Island in 1989 and 1992. All rookeries except Reef, Zapadni Reef, and Polovina Cliffs.\n\nFour rookeries (Polovina Cliffs, Reef, Tolstoi, and Vostochni).\n\nAll rookeries.\n\nin 1992 (m = 2,828, P > 0.50, G = 0.2057).\n\nThe sex ratio of all pups sampled was skewed toward males during both years and on both islands. On St. Paul Island, males comprised 53.7% and 56.4% of the pups sampled in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and 54.4% on St. George Island in 1992. The combined data sets resulted in a male bias in sex ratio of 54.7%, which was significantly different from the predicted ratio of 50%\n\n(n = 8,290, P < 0.001, G = 73.4983).\n\nMale-biased sex ratios of neonates on the Pribilof Islands in 1989 and 1992 were higher than previous reports dating back to 1896 (Fowler in press). These earlier reports indicate that historical sex ratios were highly variable, although some of the differences may have been due to different sampling techniques.\n\nIn most cases, however, variability in sex ratio appears to be male-biased. Male fitness may be more variable and more strongly influenced by parental investment than female fitness (Bateman 1948, Trivers andWillard 1973). This could be especially true for polygynous species such as the northern fur seal, where male success and fitness are enhanced by large size (Bartholomew 1970) and early growth of males is more dependent on the amount of milk obtained from the mother because males have higher energy requirements (Costa andGentry 1986, Glutton-Brock et al. 1981).\n\nTherefore, the degree to which sex ratios are highly biased toward males may be associated with the resources available to their mothers during pre-and postnatal care (Glutton-Brock and Iason 1986); One possible explanation for such biases is that males tend to grow faster and require more food than females and are more likely to die during periods of depleted food resources (Meyers 1978, Case 1978). If this is true, then conditions on St. Paul and St. George Islands in 1989 and 1990 appear to favor pup growth because male and female mortality rates were similar (indicated by live and dead sex ratio) and the sex ratio was highly biased toward male offspring (54.7%).\n\nIn addition to food availability, other factors may influence the redundant sex ratio of fur seal neonates, thereby confounding the detection and interpretation of apparent trends (Clutton-Brock and Iason 1986). Such factors include quality of habitat, maternal condition, maternal age, competition for resources, timing of insemination, or parent-offspring conflict.\n\nThe challenge is to evaluate these possible relationships and the mechanism(s) by which they operate. It is also important that all future studies assess the sex ratio of live and dead pups to detect possible changes in the-mortality rates of the two sexes.\n\nNumbers of entangled and non-entangled female seals were counted using binoculars at sample areas for each rookery.\n\nSample areas were determined as areas visible from vantage points already used to count adult males. Only seals positioned so that their necks were visible were counted. The total count and the count of entangled animals were used to 'estimate the incidence of entanglement. Characteristics of any wounds and the entangling debris were recorded, including the color and type of debris, when they could be determined. To obtain information regarding possible changes in incidence of entanglement within season, adult females were surveyed three times (11 and 22 July and 2 August) during 1992 on Reef rookery.\n\nDuring female entanglement surveys, 16,009 seals were counted in 1991 and 25,089 were counted in 1992 (Tables 23 and 24). Seven entangled adult female seals were sighted: 4 (0.025%) in 1991 and 3 (0.012%) in 1992. Each year, 6 different seals were seen with evidence (scars or wounds without visible debris) of previous entanglement. 'Including the seals with evidence of previous entanglement, the estimated incidence of. entanglement was 0.062% for 1991 and 0.036% for 1992. Entangling debris on females, and the extent of any wounds (when visible), are described in Table 25.\n\nDuring the three surveys conducted on Reef rookery in 1992, there was an increase from 0.021% to 0.155% in the incidence of scarred seals observed over the season (Table 26). There was no\n\nTable 23. --Results of adult female northern fur seal entanglement survey, St. Paul Island, Alaska, July 1991. *Entangled debris invisible.

Bigg's work on St. Paul Island indicated (as does this study) that a smaller fraction of adult females are entangled compared with juvenile males. 'Owing to the inability to distinguish age among females, and the low numbers of juvenile females that return to the breeding islands, little comparison can be made between young females and other groups within the population. Bigg reported that about 0.16% of the females surveyed were entangled compared with about 0.4% for juvenile males from 1976 to 1986. Scordino and Fisher (1983) reported seeing one entangled (presumably adult) female among an estimated 5,166 (0.02%) in a survey conducted on St. Paul Island (Reef rookery) 21 July 1982. Scordino (1985) reported entanglement involving less than 0.04% of the females from surveys conducted on St. Paul Island from June through August 1982-1984. In 1984, Scordino et al. (1988) conducted surveys on two rookeries (with, four replicates on Reef rookery). In that study the incidence of entanglement (i.e., those with observed debris) ranged from 0.017% to 0.167%. The incidence of entanglement on Reef rookery appeared to increase over the season (0.032%, 0.025%, 0.083%, and O.l67% for surveys conducted on 7, 14, 25 and 29 July 1984). The mean incidence from all samples reported for 1984 by Scordino et al. (1988) was 0.04% (in the total count of 21,600 females). Surveys of female entanglement were conducted on St. Paul Island again in 1985 (DeLong et al. 1988). Incidence of entanglement among adult females in 1985 averaged 0.140% for the three study rookeries (range = 0.06%-0.23%) in surveys conducted from July through September. Bigg (1979) did not consider seals with scars as entangled and the dates of his surveys correspond to those of this study when restricted to females with observed debris. His method for estimating incidence of entanglement (yielding 0.16%) is therefore comparable with the methods of this study producing incidences of 0.025% (1991) and 0.012% (1992) for seals with observed debris. The incidence of entanglement in 1991-1992 appears to be lower than for 1978 as reported by Bigg (1979).\n\nThe incidence of entanglement among adult female northern fur seals from the early 1980s (about 0.04%, Scordino et al. 1988) was less than observed by Bigg (1979) but was also higher than observed in 1991-1992.\n\nCompared with the incidence of entanglement for adult  et al. 1988) included seals with evidence of previous entanglement. These estimates ranged from 0.06% to 0.23% with a mean of 0.14%. The mean for 1991-1992 was 0.046% (also including seals with scars). The apparent reduction in entanglement among females in recent years is consistent with the lower incidence of entanglement among juvenile male seals (Fowler et al. 1992).\n\nTwo sets of data indicate that there may be an increase in the incidence of entanglement among adult females within season (Fig. 27). The data from Scordino et al. (1988) are for entangled seals observed with debris in 1984. The data from this study involve only scarred seals seen in 1992. Both studies are for Reef rookery. These sets of data are not directly comparable since one is for entangled seals and the other is for scarred seals. Even though the magnitudes of entanglement rates can not be compared, the parallel trends in rates over time are indicative of increases. Any such increase is likely due to the late arrival of young females (Bigg 1986) and higher rates of entanglement among these age groups (Fowler 1987a). The combination of these factors would give rise to the increase in observed incidence of entanglement owing to the increasing the incidence of entanglement and its effects on survival, characterized the entangling debris found on the seals, and compared the frequency of repeated sightings for entangled and nonentangled seals.\n\nJuvenile male northern fur seals were observed during roundups as described in Fowler et al. (1990a), Fowler andRagen (1990), andFowler andBaba (1991). Seals were herded into a group and allowed to pass between observers who watched for animals with tags or entangling debris. When an entangled or tagged seal was sighted, the flow of seals was stopped while the seal was captured and the relevant information (e.g.., tag number, tag type, degree of wound, and type of debris) was recorded.\n\nEntangled seals and control animals were tagged. All work was conducted during the breeding season when animals congregate near breeding rookeries along the shoreline of the island.\n\nEntanglement research focuses on juvenile (subadult) male seals judged to be of the size historically taken in the commercial harvest (approximately 105-125 cm in total length).\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, data in this report apply to male seals of this size. The total count and the count of entangled animals are used to estimate the incidence of entanglement.\n\nAs in all years since 1989, entangled seals were tagged and entangling debris was removed (prior to 1989; entangling debris was left on the animals). Characteristics of the entangling debris, including the type, color, and weight were recorded. The mesh and twine size were determined for net fragments and the length of materials such as packing bands and ropes was recorded.\n\nSamples were retained for future analysis. Two nonentangled seals about the same size as each entangled animal were also tagged to serve as controls when comparing rates of return.\n\nThe removal of debris was taken into account when comparing results from studies conducted before and after 1989. This was particularly important in calculating the proportion of seals entangled. Since we removed debris from seals beginning in 1989, the increased survival of these seals resulted in larger numbers being resighted, thus artificially inflating the proportion reported as entangled. To account for this, and to make the data comparable, we used the estimated relative survival of seals entangled in small debris (0.5 relative to controls from past studies : Fowler 1984b: Fowler , 1985b: Fowler , 1987a;;Fowler et al. 1989;Fowler et al. 1990a;Fowler et al. 1990b;Fowler and Ragen 1990;Fowler et al. 1992). The number of seals resighted after having had debris removed in 1991 was multiplied by this value. In other words, one-half of the resighted seals from which debris had been removed in 1991 were assumed to have been seals that would have been resighted as entangled seals in 1992 and would thus contribute to the observed proportion of the population entangled.\n\nTo calculate the entanglement rate, the growth of seals was also taken into account, as some of the surviving tagged seals were too large to meet the size criteria above. In 1992, the size of seals tagged in 1989-1991 was recorded. Thus, the estimate for incidence of entanglement only included tagged seals within the designated size criteria in the count of entangled seals. This differs from procedures for estimation of survival where seals that were previously tagged were cpunted regardless of size (i.e., entangled seals and controls both grow and both are recounted).\n\nBecause some animals are observed more than once within a season, both control and entangled seals are sampled with replacement. This differs from the method used in estimating the incidence of entanglement from the commercial harvest (prior to 1985) in which both entangled and nonentangled seals were killed.\n\nAnalytical methods used to analyze resight data to estimate the survival rate of entangled seals are from Fowler and Baba (1991):\n\nNinety-four roundups of subadult male northern fur seals were completed on St. Paul Island during July and early August of 1992 (Table 27). During these roundups, 17,630 male seals which met the size historically taken in the commercial harvest were counted.\n\nIn 1992, 22.2% of all sightings of entangled or control seals were individuals that had already been seen during the same season (34 out of the total of 153). This estimate of repeat sightings is slightly less than the values (25%-30%) calcuated from previous years (Fowler et al. 1992). Thirty-nine entangled\n\nTable 27. --Summary of roundups of juvenile (subadult) northern fur seal males conducted on St. Paul Island, Alaska, during July and August of 1992, including the number of both the control and entangled seals in the total tagged.\n\nsubadult male seals judged to meet the size criteria were captured and their debris was-removed. These seals were then double-tagged with numbered blue Allflex tags bearing the address of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (Table 28). One entangled seal tagged with a monel tag (number A07073, not replaced by an Allflex tag) was also captured and released after removing the debris. Eighty similarly sized control seals with no entangling debris were also tagged (Table 28).\n\nTagged Seals from Previous Years Sixty-seven seals which had been tagged during entanglement research in previous years were resighted in 1992 (Table 29). Of these, 7 had tags applied in 1985, 1986, and 1988. Six of the 7 resighted seals were tagged in previous years as controls. One had been entangled when tagged and had subsequently lost its entangling debris, which had been noted as being small (less than an estimated 150 g) at the first sighting of the seal.\n\nTwenty-four male seals with 1991 tags were resighted. Over 70% of these seals (n = 17) had been tagged as controls and the remainder (n = 7) had been tagged after being disentangled.\n\nTwenty-six seals were resighted with tags applied in 1990.\n\nEighteen of these (69.2%) had been tagged as controls and 8 had been tagged after being disentangled. Ten were resighted with tags applied in 1989, the first year during which debris was removed. Of these, 7 (70%) had been tagged as controls and 3 had been tagged after being disentangled.\n\nTable 28.--List of blue broad-banded Allflex tags applied to juvenile male northern fur seals during roundups conducted on St. Paul Island, Alaska, 1992.

The sizes and kinds of entangling debris, the extent of any wounds, and the tightness of the entangling debris on the animal are presented in Table 30.\n\nOf the 40 entangled seals examined, 19 (47.5%) were in trawl webbing, 9 (22.5%) were in plastic packing bands, and 7 (17.5%) were in string, small line, cords, or rope. The remaining 5 (12.5%) were entangled in other debris.\n\nThe overall incidence of entanglement is estimated by the ratio of all (both initial and subsequent) entanglement sightings to the total number of seals examined (Bengtson et al. 1988, Fowler et al. 1990b). One-half of the harvestable-sized seals resighted in 1992 after having debris removed in 1991 were counted as entangled in 1992. All seals from 1989 and 1990 were too large to be included in the calculations. In all, 51.5 sightings were used to calculate-the incidence of entanglement.\n\nThese observations included 1) seals of harvestable size observed entangled (n = 40), 2) the repeated sightings of animals disentangled in 1992 (n = 9), and 3) the seals resighted from 1991 after having had debris removed (n = 2.5). This value (n = 2.5) was obtained as follows: first, we determined whether the seals tagged in 1991 were of appropriate size. There were 13 observations of 7 individual seals tagged in 1991 after their\n\nTable 30 .--List of entangled juvenile male northern fur seals tagged during surveys conducted in July and August of 1992, nature of the debris on each animal.

Tag number for tag placed on both flippers (See Table 30).  This seal appeared to have just recently become entangled. debris had been removed, including the repeated sightings of these same seals in 1992. Five of these observations were of seals that met the size criteria. Of these five, we assumed a 50% survival rate if the seals had remained entangled, yielding a total of 2.5.\n\nThe incidence of entanglement for 1992 was calculated as 0.29% (51.5/17,630), an estimate that is subject to slight upward bias as it assumes that the seals from which debris was removed would not have lost their debris. Thus, the 1992 incidence of entanglement is within the range observed from 1988 to 1991, although it is higher than last year's value of 0.21% (Table 31, Fig. 28). This reduction is continuing evidence of a decline in the observed incidence of entanglement from the 0.4% observed between 1976 and 1985 (Fig. 28; Table 31). However, no trend is evident in the period since 1988.\n\nCompared with 1976-86, the lower incidence of entanglement among juvenile male seals is attributable to a reduction in the fraction entangled in trawl webbing. During 1982-86, the mean percent of seals entangled in trawl webbing was 0.27% (Fowler et al. 1990b). In 1988, the percent entangled in trawl webbing dropped to 0.15%; a reduction of 56% (Fowler et al. 1990b). This proportion remained low in 1989 and 1990 and became even lower in 1991 (0.06%, Table 32). In 1992, however, the rate of entanglement in trawl webbing was higher than in 1991 but remains at about 50% of the levels observed for between 1982 and 1986.  1992).\n\nTable 32. --Debris found on juvenile male northern fur seals from St. Paul Island, Alaska, 1981-92, expressed as the incidence of entanglement (observed percent) among juvenile males entangled by debris category (data for 1981-91 from Fowler and Ragen 1990, Fowler and Baba 1991, and Fowler et al. 1992).\n\nTrawl net Packing Cord, rope, Monofilament Misc.

No roundups were conducted in 1987. A total of 102 seals judged to be of harvestable size were tagged and released in 1991. Of these, 68 were controls and 34\n\nwere entangled when captured. In 1992, 17 of these controls (25.0%) were resighted. Seven (20.6%) seals tagged following removal of debris in 1991 (n = 34) were resighted in 1992. This implies that the resighting rate for disentangled seals after 1 year was 82.4% of that for the controls (20.6/25.0 = 0.824). This is not significantly different from a ratio of 1.0 (Chisquare test, P > 0.05). The resighting rate of disentangled seals relative to controls is significantly higher than that of entangled seals from previous years (Chi-square test, P < 0.05).\n\nIn 1992, 3 of the 279 \"control\" seals (1.1%) tagged in 1986 were resighted, whereas none of the group of 128 animals tagged as entangled in 1986 was resighted. Of the four seals resighted in 1992 and tagged in I988, one had been originally tagged as an entangled seal.\n\nRatios of the portion of entangled seals resighted each year to that of controls are shown in Figure 29 (updated from Fowler et al. 1992). An increase in the survival rate attributable to removing debris is shown in data plotted for seals tagged in 1989 and 1991 (stars in Fig. 29). However, the combined data for 1989-92 indicate that seals freed of their debris may have a\n\nTable 33. --Comparison of numbers of tags applied (in parentheses)\n\nand resighted (percent resighted shown in brackets below the numbers resighted) by year for entangled and nonentangled male northern fur seals from 1985 through 1992 (none tagged in 1987). Each row corresponds to the tags released in the first year for that row*.\n\nFigure 29. --Relative rates of return for entangled juvenile male northern fur seals compared with controls (nonentangled tagged seals) for varying time intervals (Updated from Fowler et al. 1992, with the data from this report). Each data point represents the fraction of entangled seals resighted divided by the fraction of controls resighted (both from Table 3-5) for the corresponding time interval (for example, there are three data points for 3 years corresponding to the 1985-88, 1986-89, and 1988-1991 intervals).\n\nThe stars correspond to the relative return rate for seals with debris removed.\n\nlower survival rate than that of controls. The weighted annual survival rate of disentangled seals for the data accumulated since 1989 is 0.93 of that for controls.\n\nThe approach of Fowler and Baba (1991; a weighted mean, assuming that the probability of resighting is the same for both categories of seals and that survival from entanglement in small debris is the same from year to year) may be used for estimating survival of entangled seals compared with controls. Using only, the ratios for the 1992 resight data for seals tagged during 1985-1988 (Fig. 29), the estimated survival of entangled seals is 0.53 that of controls. Using juvenile male seals tagged, without removing debris, in 1985, 1986, and 1988 as resighted in all years through 1992, the estimated annual survival is also 0.53. This is to be compared with the 0.55 from Fowler and Baba (1991).\n\nThus, the results from 1992, as well as the cumulative data, as presented in Table 33 and Figure 29, continue to show that the probability of survival for seals entangled in small debris is about one-half of what it would be without the debris (Fowler et al. 1990b).\n\nWeights and mesh sizes of debris removed from seals in 1992 are listed in Table 30. The data for trawl net fragments are shown by size category in Table 34 and indicate that debris distributions are very similar to those seen in previous studies.\n\nFor the combined data since 1983, about 74% of the trawl debris Table 34. --Annual percentage frequency distribution of the size of measured trawl debris from entangled male northern fur seals that were tagged and released (updated from Fowler andRagen 1990 andFowler et al. 1992).\n\nfound on seals weighed between 0 g and 150 g, about 18% of the debris weighed between 150 g and 500 g, and about 8% of the debris weighed over 500 g (Table 34).\n\nAlthough the collective data from 1985 to 1992 indicate similar intraseasonal resighting rates, there is a great deal of year-to-year variability (Table 35). Also, there is a lower intraseasonal resighting rate for entangled (or disentangled)\n\n134 Table 36. --Male northern fur seals from which entangling debris was removed in 1992 during roundups.

POPULATION MONITORING OF NORTHERN FUR SEALS ON SAN MIGUEL ISLAND, CALIFORNIA by Sharon R. Melin and Robert L. DeLong Population monitoring studies of northern fur seals on San Miguel Island were conducted between 20 May and 4 September, 1992. Efforts to resight tagged individuals for studies on survival were conducted throughout the breeding season. Once each week, counts of adult males were conducted from a blind overlooking the Adams Cove rookery. These counts provide an index of the trend in the population growth. In late July, live and dead pup counts were conducted as an additional index of the health and growth of the population. Adult males began to establish territories after 15 May. The maximum number of adult males holding territories was 72 on 8 July and 59 of those males held territories with females. The first female was sighted pup later that day. Two live pup counts counts of 1,124 pups and respectively. On Castle on 1 June and gave birth to the first were conducted in Adams Cove yielding 965 on 29 July and 5 August, Rock, 466 live pups were counted on 8 August. A dead pup count conducted in Adams Cove on 11 August yielded 274 dead pups. No dead pup count was conducted at Castle Rock. One hundred and fifty fur seal pups were tagged with pink plastic roto tags on 27 September and another 150 on 1 November (Appendix Tables Dl and D2) to continue studies. on' survival of individuals. The two tagging periods provide two different age groups of tagged pups. The pups are part of a long-term study, initiated in 1988, on the relation between survival and age at tagging. At this time sufficient data is not available to' determine if a relationship exists. In 1992, tag resighting efforts resulted in sightings of 62 individual animals including sightings of 17 tagged females in breeding groups. The oldest female sighted with a pup was El Niño events, while not predictable are a periodic.

Classifications of adult male fur seals Class 1 (shoreline)\n\nFull-grown males apparently attached to \"territories\" spaced along the water's edge at intervals of 10-15 m. Most of these animals are wet or partly wet, and some acquire harems of one to four females between 10 and 20 July. They would then be called harem males (Class 3). Class 1 males should not be confused with Class 2 animals, which have definite territories, whereas the shoreline males appear to be attached to such sites but may not be in all cases. Class 2 (territorial without females)\n\nClass 3 (territorial with females)\n\nFull-grown males that have no females, but are actively defending territories. Most of these animals are located on the inland fringe of a rookery: some are between Class 1 (shoreline) and Class 3 (territorial with females) males, and a few are completely surrounded by Class 3 males and their harems. Full-grown males actively defending territories and females. Most Class 3 males and their harems combine to form a compact mass of animals. Isolated individuals, usually with small harems, may be observed at each end of a rookery, on sandy beaches, and in corridors leading to inland hauling grounds. Some territorial males have as few as one or two females. Should these females be absent during the counts, their pups are used as a basis for putting the adult male into Class 3 rather than Class 2.\n\nTable B-l. Table B-2. Table B-3. Table B-4. Table B-5.

The application of tags was distributed among rookeries according to the proportion that each rookery contributes to the total estimate of pups born. For example, if 200,000 pups are born on St. Paul would be tagged on that rookery. After 1988, only small numbers (400-500) of females were tagged on St. Paul Island at selected study sites.
