    "abstract": "The cell fate determination factor, DACH1, plays a key role in cellular differentiation in metazoans. DACH1 is engaged in multiple context-dependent complexes that activate or repress transcription. DACH1 can be recruited to DNA via the Six1/Eya bipartite transcription (DNA-binding/co-activator) complex. c-Jun is a critical component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and can promote contact-independent growth. Herein, DACH1 inhibited c-Jun-induced DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Excision of c-Jun with Cre recombinase, in c-jun f1/f1 3T3 cells, abrogated DACH1-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis. c-Jun expression rescued DACH1-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation. DACH1 inhibited induction of c-Jun by physiological stimuli, and repressed c-jun target genes (Cyclin A, ß-PAK, Stathmin). DACH1 bound c-Jun and inhibited AP-1 transcriptional activity. c-jun and c-fos were transcriptionally repressed by DACH1, requiring the conserved N-terminal DS domain. c-fos transcriptional repression by DACH1 requires the SRF site of the c-fos promoter. DACH1 inhibited c-Jun transactivation through the δ domain of c-Jun. DACH1 co-precipitated the histone deacetylase proteins (HDAC1, HDAC2 and NCoR), providing a mechanism by which DACH1 represses c-Jun activity through the conserved δ domain. An oncogenic v-Jun deleted of the δ domain, was resistant to DACH1 repression. Collectively these studies demonstrate a novel mechanism by which DACH1 blocks c-Jun-mediated contact-independent growth through repressing the c-Jun δ domain.",
    "full_text": "Homo-or heterodimeric transcription factors with basic region-leucine zipper structure, including Jun, Fos, ATF and Maf subfamilies, regulate transcription of AP-1 responsive genes in a DNA-sequence specific manner. c-Jun encodes a critical component of the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors complex. Proliferative signals induce expression of both c-Fos and c-Jun (Karin et al., 1997;Schreiber et al., 1999). Mice genetically enginnered to abolish either c-Jun or JNK activity results in embryonic lethality (Jochum et al., 2001). Of the four mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) sub-families, c-Jun activity is regulated primarily by Jun kinase (Morton et al., 2003). The abundance of c-Jun is regulated by transcriptional induction and subsequent degradation through ubiquitination (Angel and Karin, 1991;Treier et al., 1994;Fuchs et al., 1996;Musti et al., 1997).\n\nThe c-Jun protein structure consists of multiple functional domains, including an amino-terminal transactivation domain, a regulatory (δ domain), a carboxyl terminal basic DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper protein dimerization domain. The δ domain is critical for transcriptional activation by c-Jun. One of the first reported functions of the δ domain was its engagement of cell type specific inhibitors of c-Jun (Bohmann and Tjian, 1989;Baichwal and Tjian, 1990;Baichwal et al., 1991). JNK docks to c-Jun on residues within the δ domain (Kallunki et al., 1995;Kallunki et al., 1996). Phosphorylation of c-Jun is thought to facilitate interaction of the c-Jun/AP-1 complex with co-activators.\n\nTranscriptional co-activators encoding histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity, such as the CBP co-activator, binds to c-Jun facilitating the interaction between the AP-1 complex and the basal transcriptional machinery (Mayr and Montminy, 2001).  phosphorylation also accelerates c-Jun degradation by allowing recognition of the E3 ligase from the FBW 7 containing Skp/Culin/F-box protein complex. In addition, JNK enhances activity of the E3 ligase promoting degradation of c-Jun and JunB (Gao et al., 2004;Nateri et al., 2004). c-Jun contributes to contact-independent growth and is essential for the development of chemically-induced tumors in mice (Eferl et al., 2003). Both cellular Jun (c-Jun) and viral Jun (v-Jun) induce oncogenic transformation (Vogt, 2001). The retrovirally transduced allele of c-Jun, v-Jun, induces fibrosarcoma in chickens (reviewed in (Vogt, 2001). Oncogenic v-jun encodes a protein with complete deletion of the δ domain and fails to bind JNK. The role of the δ domain itself vs JNK phosphorylation sites within the δ domain, in cell-cycle control, cellular proliferation and oncogenesis is complex.\n\nAlthough c-Jun promotes G1/S phase progression independently of its phosphorylation status (Wisdom et al., 1999), c-Jun phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 were required for Ha-Ras induced cellular transformation in some (Smeal et al, 1991), but not all studies (Kennedy et al., 2003). Finally, although point mutation analysis demonstrated the oncogenic effects of the δ domain deletion can be uncoupled from JNK signaling (Sprowles and Wisdom, 2003), mice and cells harboring a mutant allele of c-jun show reduced tumorigenesis by activated Ras signaling (Bannister et al., 1991).\n\nA variety of mechanisms attenuate c-Jun mediated activity (Schutte et al., 1989).\n\nFactors regulating c-jun stability inhibit c-Jun function through reducing its abundance.\n\nThese factors include MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) (Kleemann et al., 2000), E3 ligase Fbw 7-containing Skp/Culin/F-box prtein complex (SCF Fbw ) (Gao et al., 2004), and the E3 ligase Itch (Nateri et al., 2004). Jab1 association with MIF inhibits Jab1-11-19-06 mediated AP-1 activity. Thus, the cytokine MIF serves to transduce cytokines signaling to nuclear c-Jun function. Components of the AP-1 complex itself can inhibit c-Jun activity.\n\nThe AP-1 transcription factor family is composed of Jun, Fos and ATF subunits, which interact through their leucine zipper motif and bind DNA through a basic region. Jun proteins form homo and heterodimers. A number of other basic proteins heterodimerize with c-Jun, including Maf (v-Maf, c-Maf, MafB, MafG, MafK) proteins and the neural retina leucine zipper gene product 1 (Nr1) which may, thereby regulate the activity of c-Jun (Angel and Karin, 1991). Finally, c-Jun binding repressor proteins have been described.\n\nThe c-Jun-interacting proteins JDP1 and JDP2 regulate UV-mediated apoptosis (Piu et al., 2001). Recent genome-wide interrogation identified an inhibitor of AP-1 responsive target genes as the DACH1 gene which is known to be involved in compound eye development (Wu et al., 2003).\n\nDevelopment of the compound eye in Drosophila is governed by a regulatory network of genes. The eyeless, sine oculis, eyes absent and dachshund genes are required for normal eye development and ectopic expression of eyeless, eyes absent and dachshund induce ectopic eye formation. This regulatory pathway, conserved amongst metazoans and the vertebrate homologues of eyeless (Pax6), sine oculis (Six1-6), eyes absent (Eya1-4) and dachshund (DACH1-2), contributes to organism development (Kawakami et al., 2000).\n\nThe six genes encode a conserved Six and Homeo domain sequence-specific DNA binding family of transcription factors. Eya functions as a co-activator for Six proteins, and functions in a phosphatase-dependent manner (Lee et al., 2000a). The dachshund genes encode co-integrator proteins recruited to Six binding sites at the promoters of target genes that promote cellular differentiation and cell cycle exit. A conserved domain  Domain 1, DD1), which has significant identity with the Ski/Sno (DS domain), is conserved from drosophila to the human (Chen et al., 1997;Davis et al., 1999;Kawakami et al., 2000). The DACH1 protein binds the CBP co-activator or interacts directly with corepressors to regulate transcriptional activity (Ikeda et al., 2002;Li et al., 2003). The recruitment of DACH1 to Six binding sites is regulated through mechanisms that have as yet to be defined.\n\nIn view of the finding that c-Jun plays a key role in oncogene-induced transformation and that DACH1 functions as an inhibitor of AP-1-responsive gene expression, we investigated the potential role for DACH1 in c-Jun-mediated cellular growth. DACH1 inhibited c-Jun-mediated DNA synthesis and contact-independent growth. AP-1 activity was repressed by DACH1 requiring a conserved (DS) domain.\n\nTo determine the role of Dachshund1 in fibroblast cellular proliferation and growth, NIH3T3 cells were transduced with a retroviral expression plasmid encoding DACH1 linked to GFP through an internal ribosomal entry site. Homogeneously transduced populations of NIH3T3 cells were compared to cells transduced with an empty expression vector (MSCV-IRES-GFP). DACH1 expression inhibited tritiated thymidine uptake by 75% (Fig. 1A). To determine the domain of DACH1 involved in cellular proliferation, a mutation of the conserved dachshund domain (DS) was assessed. NIH3T3 cells transduced with the mutant DACH1 protein, which was expressed in equal amounts by Western blotting, failed to inhibit tritiated thymidine uptake (Fig. 1A). Cellular proliferation assays were conducted by serial counting of cell number (Fig. 1B) and the MTT stain (Fig. 1C).\n\nCells transduced with DACH1 failed to proliferate, whereas cells transduced with either a mutant DACH1 deleted of the DS domain or the GFP vector alone proliferated with similar efficiency. FACS analysis of DACH1 transduced NIH3T3 cells demonstrated an inhibition of DNA synthesis, that was dependent upon the DS domain (Fig. 1D). Expression of the DACH1 mutant, DACH1ΔDS was similar to the DACH1 wild type as assessed by western blot analysis of the Flag epitope at the N-terminus of each protein (Fig. 1E).\n\nPrevious studies had shown AP-1 reporter activity was inhibited by DACH1 (Wu et al., 2003). Endogenous AP-1 activity contributes to 3T3 cell proliferation. To examine the importance of c-Jun as an endogenous target of DACH1-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis, we used c-jun-deficient 3T3 cells. c-jun -/-mice die in gestation from 11-19-06 cardiovascular and hepatic defects (Eferl et al., 1999). Significant functional differences have been observed in MEFs derived from ES cell knockout, compared with cells derived by acute target gene excision using floxed alleles and Cre recombinase (Sage et al., 2003).\n\nWe therefore derived c-jun fl/fl 3T3 cells from c-jun fl/fl mice (Zenz et al., 2003) using a standard protocol (Todaro and Green, 1963). The c-jun fl/fl 3T3 cells were transduced with Cre recombinase (Sage et al., 2003) and the deletion of c-Jun was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). These cells were transduced with either a DACH1 retroviral expression vector or equal amount of control viral vector, and Western blot analysis and cellular proliferation assays were conducted. c-jun deletion was associated with a reduction in cyclin D1 and cyclin A expression consistent with prior findings that c-jun induces cyclin D1 and cyclin A (Albanese et al., 1995). DACH1 expression in c-jun fl/fl cells reduced cyclin D1 abundance 30%, and cyclin A expression 50% (Fig. 2A). DACH1 expression in parental c-jun fl/fl 3T3 cells reduced proliferation rates > 35%. In cells deleted of c-jun (c-jun fl/fl + Cre), expression of DACH1 failed to inhibit cellular proliferation (Fig 2B). A detailed time course was conducted to determine the role of c-jun in DACH1mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation through daily counting of cells (Fig. 2C).\n\nCellular proliferation of wild type cells was inhibited by DACH1 expression, however, the proliferation rate of cells deleted of c-jun were not affected by DACH1 expression (Fig. 2C). To determine whether expression of c-Jun could overcome DACH1-mediated repression of cellular proliferation, a cell line encoding a doxycycline-inducible c-jun cDNA was utilized (3T3 Tet-c-Jun). The induction of c-Jun expression by the addition of doxycycline stimulated cellular proliferation (Fig. 2D). Transduction of the NIH3T3 cells with DACH1 reduced cellular proliferation >60% at 6 days. Induction of c-Jun abundance, 11-19-06 through the addition of doxycycline restored cellular proliferation by >85% (Fig. 2E).\n\nTogether these studies demonstrate DACH1 inhibition of cellular proliferation requires cjun and can be overcome by c-Jun expression.\n\nThe expression of c-Jun is sufficient to induce contact-independent growth of Rat1a cells (Schutte et al., 1989). The stable cell line expressing doxycycline-inducible c-Jun was infected with an MSCV virus encoding either GFP, DACH1 wt or DACH1 mutant.\n\nWestern blot analysis demonstrated the induction of c-Jun by doxycycline and transfected DACH1 protein was detected by an antibody directed to the N-terminal Flag epitope (Fig. 3A). DACH1 also inhibited basal proliferation of Rat1a-J4 cells (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of c-Jun in promoting cell-cycle transition (Ryseck et al., 1988;Kovary and Braco, 1991). The c-Jun-induced thymidine uptake, reflecting DNA synthesis, was attenuated by DACH1 expression (Fig. 3C). Colony formation was induced by c-Jun expression (Fig. 3D) as previously described (Katabami et al., 2005). Transduction of the inducible c-Jun stable cell line with a retroviral expression vector encoding DACH1 reduced the number of colonies by 40% (Fig. 3E) and reduced the volume of individual colonies by >75% (Fig. 3F). Expression of equal amount of a mutant DACH1 protein deleted of the DS domain (ΔDS) failed to inhibit c-Jun induced contactindependent growth (Fig. 3F). Together, these results suggest that DACH1 inhibits c-Jun induced cellular proliferation and blocks c-Jun-mediated contact-independent growth. These results further suggest c-Jun is a key molecular target of DACH1-inhibition of contact-independent growth.\n\nThe c-jun gene is induced by diverse physiological stimuli, including serum and growth factors. To determine whether DACH1 expression was capable of inhibiting the induction To examine further the mechanism by which DACH1 repressed the c-jun target gene, cyclin A, we deployed the tetracycline inducible c-jun stable Rat1a-J4 cell line (Fig. 4B). Doxycycline addition induced c-Jun abundance, associated with the induction of the cjun target genes cyclin A and ß-PAK. Transduction of Rat1a-J4 cells with DACH1 abrogated c-Jun-mediated induction of cyclin A and ß-PAK, without affecting ß-actin expression. Thus DACH1 inhibits c-Jun-mediated induction of cyclin A. To determine whether endogenous DACH1 regulates c-Jun expression and c-Jun target gene expression, DACH1 siRNA was used. DACH1 siRNA reduced DACH1 abundance by ~75% 11-19-06 associated with 2.5 fold induction of c-Jun abundance (Fig. 4C). The c-jun target gene cyclin D1 (Albanese et al., 1995) was induced 3-fold and cyclin A was induced 2-5-fold (Fig. 4C). Consistent with a key role for cyclin D1 in 3T3 cell DNA synthesis (Albanese et al., 2003) the DACH1 siRNA-mediated induction of cyclin D1 was associated with an induction of DNA synthesis determined by 3 H thymidine uptake and S phase distribution by FACS (Fig. 4C).\n\nIn order to determine whether DACH1 directly regulated c-jun target genes, the cyclin A and stathmin promoters were assessed. Induction of c-Jun expression in the Rat1a-J4 cells by addition of doxycycline induced the activity of the cyclin A promoter activity 4fold (Fig. 4D). Expression of DACH1 inhibited c-Jun-mediated induction of cyclin A promoter activity. Deletion of the DACH1 DS domain abolished the DACH1 repression function (Fig. 4D). Similarly the stathmin promoter was induced by c-Jun, and c-Jun induction of the stathmin promoter was inhibited by DACH1, requiring the DACH1 DS domain (Fig. 4E).\n\nAs DACH1 repressed c-jun mediated induction of several AP-1 target genes (Wu et al., 2003), we sought to determine whether DACH1 occupied AP-1 sites of endogenous genes in the context of their local chromatin structure. For these studies NIH3T3 cells were stably transduced with a Flag-tagged DACH1 expression vector. The cyclin A promoter, a known c-Jun target gene, was examined. Using oligonucleotides directed to the endogenous murine cyclin A promoter AP-1/ATF-1 site, ChIP assays, conducted with the anti-Flag 11-19-06 antibody, demonstrated the presence of DACH1 in the context of the local chromatin structure of the endogenous cyclin A promoter (Fig 5A). Control IgG did not result in similar amplification. Analysis of the endogenous murine cyclin D1 AP-1 site using oligonucleotides directed to the murine promoter demonstrated the presences of DACH1 at the cyclin D1 promoter AP-1 site (Fig. 5B). The complex formation of c-Jun and Dach1 protein at the AP-1 site of the cyclin D1 promoter was further confirmed by sequential immune-precipitation with c-Jun and Flag antibodies (Fig. 5C). Further analysis of the endogenous proteins associated with DACH1 at the murine cyclin D1 promoter was conducted. Oligonucleotides directed to the murine cyclin D1 AP-1 site evidenced the presence of the DACH1 associated co-repressor proteins, HDAC1, HDAC3, mSin3A and NCoR recruited to the murine cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 5D). In order to determine the role of the cyclin D1 promoter AP-1 site in recruitment of DACH1, ChIP assays were conducted comparing the wild type and mutant cyclin D1 AP-1 site promoters (Fig. 5E).\n\nExpression of Flag-tagged DACH1 enhanced recruitment of DACH1 (Flag), together with HDAC1, HDAC3, mSin3A and NCoR. Mutation of the cyclin D1 AP-1 site reduced recruitment of each of these proteins (Fig. 5E). Immune-precipitation western blot indicated these proteins form a cellular complex (Fig. 5F).\n\nTo determine the domains of DACH1 involved in inhibiting c-Jun function, an AP-1 responsive reporter gene (3TP-LUX) was assessed in HEK 293T cells. The activity of the AP-1 reporter gene was inhibited by DACH1 expression (Fig. 6A). The deletion of the DACH1 DS domain abrogated repression of AP-1 reporter activity and the DS domain 11-19-06 alone was insufficient for repression of AP-1 activity (Fig. 6A). We assessed the effect of DACH1 on the transcriptional activity of the key AP-1 genes, c-jun, junB, and c-fos. The transcriptional activity of the c-Jun promoter was repressed by DACH1 expression and this transcriptional repression was abrogated by the deletion of the conserved DS domain (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the junB and c-fos promoters were repressed by DACH1 expression and the DS domain were required for repression (Fig. 6C, D).\n\nAP-1 activity is serum-inducible and serum induction of the c-jun promoter was inhibited by DACH1 expression (Fig. 6E). Similarly, the c-fos promoter induction by serum was inhibited by DACH1 expression (Fig. 6F). DACH1 shares homology with Ski (Kozmik et al., 1999). To determine whether Ski functions as a transcriptional repressor of c-fos or c-jun promoter activity, serum induction experiments were conducted. Ski expression failed to repress serum-induced c-jun and c-fos promoter activity (Fig. 6G). Thus, c-fos was repressed by DACH1 and not by Ski. Together, these results demonstrate distinct transcriptional repression profiles of DACH1 and the related Ski protein.\n\nWe examined further the DNA sequences of the c-fos promoter required for transcriptional repression by DACH1. A point mutant of the SCF binding site and the TCF-binding site of the c-fos promoter were compared (Fig. 7A). Consistent with previous findings (Hill et al., 1995), mutation of either the c-fos SRE or TCF-binding site reduced serum-induced activation of the c-fos promoter (Fig. 7B). The c-fos promoter encoding a point mutation of either the SRE or the TCF site was compared for repression by DACH1.\n\nDACH1 repressed activity of the c-fos promoter, encoding a mutation of the TCF site (c-fos PM18) (Fig. 7C). In contrast, point-mutation of the SRE binding site (c-fos PM12) abrogated repression by DACH1, inducing transactivation rather than repression by 11-19-06 DACH1 (Fig. 7D). These results demonstrate the SRE site of the c-fos promoter is a transcriptional target of DACH1 repression in 3T3 cells. To determine whether these effects were similar in other cell types, MCF-7 cells were assessed. The c-fos promoter was activated 6-fold by TPA (Fig. 7E). Point mutation of either the TCF or SRE site of the cfos promoter reduced activation by TPA. Consistent with findings in NIH3T3 cells, DACH1 repressed the c-fos promoter and point mutation of the SRE site abrogated repression (Fig. 7F). Collectively these studies demonstrate DACH1 inhibits the physiological induction of the promoters encoding AP-1 response genes, including c-jun, junB and c-fos. The mechanism by which DACH1 inhibits gene expression is distinct from the related protein Ski.\n\nIn order to examine further the mechanisms by which DACH1 inhibited c-Jun transactivation, mammalian two-hybrid studies were undertaken. Comparison was made between either wild type c-Jun or c-Jun proteins encoding either a deletion of the delta domain (del δ c-Jun) or the v-Jun protein. The v-Jun protein differs from the wild type c-Jun primarily by the deletion of the δ domain. Previous studies with these expression vectors have demonstrated the presence of a c-Jun inhibitor functioning through the δ domain (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990). The heterologous transactivation domains of c-Jun linked to the E2 DNA-binding domain were assessed using a multimeric E2 DNA-binding domain, linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 8A). The wild type and mutant chimeric c-Jun proteins were expressed equally in DACH1 transfected cells (Fig. 8B). Activity of the c-Jun protein was enhanced by oncogenic Ras (Ha-RasV12) consistent with previous 11-19-06 findings that Ras alleviates repression of a c-Jun inhibitor (Baichwal et al., 1991). DACH1 expression inhibited c-Jun transactivation by Ha-RasV12 (Fig. 8C). To determine the domains of c-Jun repressed by DACH1, comparison were made between c-Jun and the mutant c-Jun proteins. c-Jun E2 activity was repressed by DACH1 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the del δ c-Jun and v-Jun activities were not repressed by DACH1 (Fig. 8D). To determine the role endogenous DACH1 as an inhibitor of c-jun transactivation function, DACH1 shRNA was used in 3T3 cells. The transactivation function of c-jun was enhanced by expression of DACH1 shRNA (Fig. 8E). Activity of both the c-Jun protein deleted of the δ domain and v-Jun, was constitutively more active than the corresponding c-Jun protein, and were unaffected by depletion of DACH1 abundance (Fig. 8E). Similarly, shRNA expression to DACH1 enhanced AP-1 activity using on AP-1 responsive reporter gene (Fig. 8F). These findings suggest the δ domain of c-Jun is required for endogenous DACH1 repression of c-Jun transactivation activity.\n\nTo examine further the mechanisms by which DACH1 repressed oncogenic Rasinduced activity of c-Jun, a series of Gal4-c-Jun expression vectors were used (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990) (Fig. 9A). The interaction between DACH1 and c-Jun were assessed using a mammalian two-hybrid system and activity of c-Jun was determined using a multimeric Gal4 DNA binding site linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 9B). VP16-DACH1 demonstrated no functional interaction with the Gal4-DBD. Co-introduction of VP16-DACH1 enhanced transactivation with Gal4-c-Jun, indicating functional interaction between DACH1 and c-Jun and the induction of transactivation by the recruitment of the potent acidic transactivation surface of VP-16 to the minimal E1B promoter. Thus, DACH1 functionally interacts with c-Jun in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 9B). To determine 11-19-06 the effect of DACH1 expression on c-Jun activity, DACH1 was co-expressed with an expression vector encoding Gal4-c-Jun 5-253 and c-Jun activity determined using luciferase reporter activity. DACH1 repressed Gal4-c-Jun activity (Fig. 9C). The DACH1 mutant ∆DS, however, was incapable of repressing of Gal4-c-Jun activity (Fig. 9C). These findings are consistent with the previous studies, in which DACH1 inhibition of AP-1 activity required the DS domain. The activity of Gal4-c-Jun was enhanced by oncogenic Ras, however, deletion of amino acids 1 to 139 abrogated Ras-induced transactivation (Fig. 9D), consistent with previous findings (Baichwal et al., 1991). DACH1 inhibited c-Jun activation by Ras (Fig. 9E). Together, these results demonstrate: first, that DACH1 inhibits oncogenic Ras-induced transactivation of c-Jun, second, that DACH1 associates with and inhibits c-Jun activity, third that physical association of DACH1 with c-Jun is necessary but insufficient for repression, and fourth that the c-Jun δ domain is required for DACH1 repression.\n\nTo examine further the mechanisms by which DACH1 represses c-Jun, we compared the properties of DACH1-mediated repression of c-Jun, with the properties of a previously described inhibitor of c-Jun. Previous studies using in vivo competition assays identified an inhibitor of c-Jun activity (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990;Baichwal et al., 1991).\n\nIn these prior studies, co-expression of the mammalian expression vector encoding either the wild type or mutant c-Jun was used to identify the domains of c-Jun required for interaction with the δ domain inhibitory factor (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990;Baichwal et al., 1991). In our experiments, the ability of DACH1 to repress activity of c-Jun-E2 was overcome by c-Jun expression in trans (lane 3 vs. 5, Fig. 10A). To determine the domains of c-Jun capable of binding DACH1, immunoprecipitation Western blot analysis were 11-19-06 conducted using truncated or mutant c-Jun (Fig. 10B). The c-Jun mutants were detectable c-Jun promotes G 1 phase progression and c-Jun is necessary for G 0 /G 1 and S phase progression (Ryseck et al., 1988;Kovary and Bravo, 1991). The finding that DACH1 inhibited the DNA synthetic phase of the cell-cycle is consistent with the known role of c-Jun to promote G 1 / S phase transition. The mechanism by which DACH1 inhibited c-Jun expression involved inhibition of AP-1 activity. c-Fos and c-Jun, which contribute to AP-1 activity, were transcriptionally repressed by DACH1. c-Jun abundance is regulated in part by of c-Jun gene transcription (Angel et al., 1988;Treier et al., 1994;Fuchs et al., 1996;Musti et al., 1997). The c-Jun promoter, which is auto-regulated by AP-1 activity mediated through an AP-1 binding site (Angel et al., 1988;Kayahara et al., 2005) was repressed by DACH1. Thus, c-Jun expression and transcription were both inhibited by DACH1.\n\nThe current studies identify DACH1 as a c-Jun repressor protein extending prior observations that c-Jun binds JDP1 and JDP2 (Piu et al., 2001). Recent studies using genome-wide microarray analysis suggested a potential new mechanism controlling AP-1 activity (Wu et al., 2003). In these studies, inducible expression of the cell fate determination factor, DACH1, inhibited expression of the genes governing cellular migration, adhesion and growth, many of which are AP-1 responsive ( Wu et al., 2003).\n\nThe abundance and activity of c-Jun is a critical determent of tumor progression and contact independent growth. Compelling evidence for a key role of c-Jun in tumor 11-19-06 progression was the finding that disruption of the c-jun gene in murine hepatocytes prevents the emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma (Eferl et al., 2003). DACH1 repression of c-Jun expression provides an additional mechanism controlling c-Jun abundance and function. DACH1 protein is lost during tumor progression, providing a mechanism by which c-Jun activity may be increased, contributing to contact-independent growth. Thus the current studies suggest an additional mechanism by which c-Jun transformation function is kept in check through the endogenous inhibitory protein DACH1. c-Jun is sufficient for the induction of anchorage-independent growth of Rat1a cells (Schutte et al., 1989;Katabami et al., 2005). Herein, c-Jun-induced contact-independent growth was blocked by the cell fate determination factor DACH1. DACH1 inhibition of c-Jun-induced cellular growth required a conserved domain (DS domain). c-Jun acts in conjunction with Ras-V12 to transform rodent fibroblasts (Alani et al., 1991;Binetruy et al., 1991). c-Jun is required for transformation by several collaborative oncogenes including Ras, c-Fos, Raf, c-Myc, Mos and Abl (Rapp et al., 1994;Johnson et al., 1996).\n\nThe finding that DACH1 blocks c-Jun function raises the possibility that DACH1 may inhibit multiple distinct oncogenic signaling pathways that converge on c-Jun. The mechanism by which c-Jun induces cellular growth and tumor progression is not well understood (Maeda and Karin, 2003). It has been proposed that c-Jun contributes to the onset and progression of tumorigenesis, in part through c-Jun inhibition of apoptosis via a p53-dependent cellular pathway (Eferl et al., 2003). The defect in proliferation of c-jundeficient cells has been attributed to elevated expression of p53 and p21 CIP1 and several downstream targets of c-Jun, are required, but not sufficient, for induction of contactindependent growth including stathmin, HMG 1/Y and cyclin A (Kinoshita et al., 2003;11-19-06 Hommura et al., 2004;Katabami et al., 2005). DACH1 inhibited the physiological induction by serum of the c-Jun target genes, cyclin A and β-PAK. The expression of c-Jun with a doxycycline inducible stable cell line (Rat1a-J4) induced expression of cyclin A. In the current studies, DACH1 repression of c-Jun required the c-Jun δ domain.\n\nActivity of the v-Jun E2 fusion protein, which deletes the δ domain, was resistant to 11-19-06 DACH1 repression. The c-Jun δ domain engages cell-specific inhibitors of c-Jun (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990). Putative inhibitors of this domain include catalytically inactive JNK (Dai et al., 1995;Ljungdahl et al., 1997). JNK binds and phosphorylates c-Jun at serine 63 and 73. The role of the δ domain itself vs JNK phosphorylation within the N-terminus of c-Jun for cellular DNA synthesis and transformation remains controversial. C-Jun promotion of G1 phase progression appears to be independent of its phosphorylation (Wisdom et al., 1999). The JNK binding site of c-Jun can by uncoupled from its transformation capabilities in same studies (Sprowles and Wisdom, 2003). Thus, mutation of the JNK phosphorylation sites did not affect the transformation activity of c-Jun in chicken embryo fibroblasts (Vogt, 2001). Furthermore, JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the c-Jun amino (N) terminus may not be required for Ras-induced cellular transformation (Johnson et al., 1996;Kennedy et al., 2003). In contrast with these studies mice and cells encoding a mutant allele of c-jun in which the JNK phosphorylation site has been mutated, demonstrated an important role for these residues in c-jun-dependent transformation (Behrens et al., 2000). Furthermore, although mutation of serine 63 and 73 in v-Jun did not alter transforming activity of v-jun, mutation of these residues in c-jun reduced cooperation with Ha-Ras in oncogenic transformation (Binetruy et al., 1991). The current studies are consistent with a role for DACH1 as an inhibitor of the c-Jun δ domain.\n\nRas are often correlated (Alani et al., 1991;Smeal et al., 1991), although exceptions exist in avian and yeast systems (Vogt, 2001). In the current studies, DACH1 inhibited c-Junmediated transactivation. DACH1 binding to the N-terminal domain of c-Jun may repress c-Jun activity by recruiting co-repressor interfering with co-activator binding. CBP binds to 11-19-06 the N-terminal region of c-Jun (Bannister et al., 1991;Mayr and Montminy, 2001) and RH2/Gu-RNA-helicase (Westermarck et al., 2002). The co-recruitment of histone deacetylase proteins, HDAC1 and HDAC3 by DACH1, to c-Jun and thereby, to an AP-1 binding site provides one mechanism by which DACH1 may regulate AP-1 signaling.\n\nRecent studies suggested that the c-Jun δ domain may interact with a yet unidentified protein which recruits HDAC3 (Weiss et al., 2003). The relative importance of DACH1 in recruitment of histone deacetylase to c-Jun remains to be further explored.\n\nHerein, DACH1 repressed c-fos promoter. DACH1 transcriptional repression was abolished by point mutation of the SRE site. In the current studies, serum-induced c-fos promoter activity was reduced by point mutation in either the TCF or SRE binding site.\n\nExtracellular stimuli enhance TCF transcriptional activity through the MAPK family of extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs, JNKs, p38s), which phosphorylate the TCF transactivation domain (Whitmarsh et al., 1995;Whitmarsh et al., 1997). The SRF site of the c-fos promoter is induced by RhoA independently of MAPKs (Sotiropoulos et al., 1999;Miralles et al., 2003). RhoA induction of SRF involves ROCK and phosphorylation of LIM kinase (Hill et al., 1995). Activation of SRF involves a decrease in the cellular pool of monomeric actin (Sotiropoulos et al., 1999). LIM kinase-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin induces the stabilization of polymerized actin (F-actin) which is sensed by SRF to induce its activity (Sotiropoulos et al., 1999;Miralles et al., 2003). DACH1 regulates cytoskeletal proteins and their function as evidenced by genome wide analysis of molecular genetic targets (Wu et al., 2003). Although speculative the finding that DACH1 inhibits cfos promoter activity through the SRF site, is consistent with a role for DACH1 in regulating a RhoA/ROCK/LIM kinase cytoskeletal signaling pathway.\n\nFlag peptide for DACH1, DACH1 DS-domain alone (DS) or DACH1 DS-domain deleted (ΔDS) were previously described (Wu et al., 2003). The Flag-tagged DACH1 c-DNA was subcloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP and pLRT vector. The full length DACH1 cDNA was subcloned in frame with the VP16 activation domain in pVP16 vector to form a DACH1-VP16 fusion protein. DACH1 shRNA in the pSM2 expression vector was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and subcloned into the LMP retroviral vector. The Ski cDNAs was subcloned into the 3x Flag-CMV7.1 vector (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The expression vector encoding adenovirus-induced Cre expression or control viruses were previously described (Wang et al., 1995). The cyclin A promoter (Katabami et al., 2005) and stathmin promoter (Kinoshita et al., 2003) reporter genes were previously described. The wt c-fos-LUC, SRE, or TCF mutants (PM12 and PM18) were previously described (Wang et al., 1998). AP-1 Luc (3TPlux), c-Jun Luc and JunB Luc were previously described (Watanabe et al., 1996). The expression vectors for c-Jun linked to Gal4 or E2 and truncated c-Jun were previously described (Baichwal and Tjian, 1990;Baichwal et al., 1991). The Ha-Ras expression vector was previously described (Albanese et al., 1995).\n\nCell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Luciferase Assays. Cell culture, DNA transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (Fu et al., 2000;Fu et al., 2002;Fu et al., 2003). The NIH3T3, HEK293T and MCF-7 cell line were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. c-jun fl/fl 3T3 cells were derived from mouse embryo fibroblast from c-jun fl/fl 11-19-06 transgenic mouse (Zenz et al., 2003) using the standard 3T3 protocol. Rat1a-J4 cells express c-Jun in a doxycycline-controlled manner (Katabami et al., 2005). Cells were plated at a density of 1 x 10 5 cells in a 24-well plate on the day prior to transfection with Superfect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). At least two different plasmid preparations of each construct were used. In cotransfection experiments, a dose response was determined in each experiment with 50 and 200 ng of expression vector and the promoter reporter plasmids (1µg). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection using β-galactosidase reporters as an internal control. Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an Autolumat LB 953 (EG&G Berthold). The -fold effect was determined for 50-200 ng of expression vector with comparison made to the effect of the empty expression vector cassette and statistical analyses was performed using the Mann Whitney U test.\n\nsiRNA Transfection, Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Assays. The Dach1 siRNA target sequence is 5'-AAAGTGGCTTCCTTTACGGTG. Control siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz. Dach1 specific siRNAs or control siRNAs (100 nM or 200 nM) were transfected following the oligofectamine protocol (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was monitored by no-silencing fluorescein siRNA from Qiagen. 3T3 cells were infected with DACH1 shRNA or control retrovirus and selected by puromycin. Western blot analysis using antibodies to c-Jun (Santa Cruz), cyclin A (Santa Cruz), β-PAK(Santa Cruz), E2 tag (Abcam), Flag tag (Sigma) and the loading control guanine dissociation inhibitor (GDI) was conducted as previously described (Lee et al., 2000b;Wu et al., 2003).\n\nHEK293T cells were used for the detection of protein-protein interaction in vivo and immunoprecipitation was conducted as previously described using an anti-HA antibody 11-19-06 and immunoblotting with antibodies to HDAC1 (SC-7872), HDAC3 (SC-17795), NCoR (SC-8994), p300 (SC-585) and c-Jun (SC-44, SC-1694).\n\nCell Cycle and DNA Synthesis Analysis. Cell cycle parameters were determined using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA. Each sample was analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan Flow Cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences, Mansfield, MA) using a 488 nm laser.\n\nHistograms were analyzed for cell cycle compartments using ModFit version 2.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. DNA synthesis was analyzed by 3 H-TdR incorporation. 10 5 cells were plated into 24-well plate and cultured for 36 h. 1 μCi of 3 H-TdR was added to each well and culture continued for 2 h. Cells were washed and fixed before measuring incorporated 3 H-TdR by liquid scintillation.\n\nCell Proliferation Assays. For the MTT assay, NIH3T3 cells infected with MSCV-IRES-GFP, MSCV-DACH1-IRES-GFP or MSCV-DACH1ΔDS-IRES-GFP, and were seeded into 96 well plates in normal growth medium, and cell growth was measured every day by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. c-Junexpressing Rat1a-J4 cells were plated in growth medium in either the presence or absence of doxycycline (2 µg/ml). To measure growth curve, cells were seeded into 12 well plates and serially counted for 5 to 6 days.\n\nColony Formation Assay. 4.0 x 10 3 Rat1a-J4 cells were plated in triplicate in 3 ml of 0.3% agarose (sea plaque) in complete growth medium in the presence or absence of 2 µg/ml doxycycline overlaid on a 0.5% agarose base, also in complete growth medium. 2 weeks after incubation, colonies more than 50 µm in diameter were counted using an 11-19-06\n\nOmnicon 3600 image analysis system. The colonies were visualized after staining with 0.04% crystal violet in methanol for 1-2 h.\n\nChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (Fu et al., 2004). PCR primers for murine cyclin A: Forward: 5'-\n\nReverse: 5'-TCAAGTAGCCCGCGACTATTGAATAT. Murine cyclin D1 AP-1 site: Forward: 5'-CCGGTGGTCTGGTTCCTGGA, reverse: 5'-CCCCGAAAATTCCAGCAACA. The cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde buffer for 10 minutes at 37ºC and the procedure followed as described earlier (Fu et al ., 2004). Double ChIP assay was performed first using polyclonal c-Jun antibody, and then elution was diluted with 10 X volume of IP buffer, then immune-precipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibody following standard protocol.\n\n11-19-06 (A) NIH3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either DACH1, or a mutant of DACH1 deleting the DS domain (∆DS) or a control vector (GFP). 48 hours posttransfection, tritiated thymidine incorporation was determined (*P<0.01).
