The field is part of a major productive trend lying along the eastern edge of the Central Basin Platform (fig. 1). Other significant fields lying along the same trend and producing from the Upper Permian Grayburg and San Andres Formations include Yates, Dune, Cowden, Foster, Goldsmith, and Means (Bebout and Harris, 1986). Total areal extent of McElroy field is in excess of 50 mi2, of which a 35-mi2 portion is entirely Chevron operated (fig. 2). The remainder, the North McElroy Unit, is operated by Texaco. The Chevron-operated portion of McElroy field is the subject of this paper.\n\nIn-place total resenres for the field are estimated to be 3,000 million barrels (MMbbl) of oil, of which approximately 601 MMbbl are recoverable (436 MMbbl from the Chevron-operated portion of the field). Cumulative production is 513 MMbbl from the entire fiekl and 363 MMbbl from the Chevronoperated portion; current annual production from the Chevronoperated part of the field is 6 MMbbl of oil and 28 MMbbl of water, with a decline rate of 6 percent.\n\nMcElroy field and the giant Yates field to the southeast were discovered in 1926 during initial exploration along the Central Basin Platform. Structure was mapped and inferred using surface geology, scant well data from elsewhere in the basin, and trend drilling. Gulf Oil completed the J. T. McElroy No. 1, the discovery well for the field (Section 203, Block F, C.C.S.D. & R.G.N.G. Railroad Survey), which had an initial production of approximately 500 bbl of oil per day. Production in McElroy field is predominantly from porosity zones within dolostones of the Grayburg Formation (Upper Permian, lower Guadalupian) (fig. 3). Other deeper zones with shows andlor production in the field are the Lower Permian (Wolfcamp), Pennsylvanian (Bend), and Devonian, Silurian, and Ordovician (Ellenburger).\n\nReservoir energy in McElroy field was initially provided by a solution-gas drive mechanism. Development was first concentrated in what is now the central portion of the field. Field expansion and subsequent development started in 1930 and proceeded in several stages. Expansion was the result of a series of step-out wells that were completed with the assistance of a hydraulic fracturing procedure. These step-out wells added thousands of productive acres to the McElroy properties. Drilling in most of the Chevron-operated portions of McElroy field, encompassing about 18,600 acres and containing some 1,800 wells, has been developed on 10-acre spacing (fig. 4).\n\nPilot waterfloods were initiated in McElroy field in 1959 and 1960 (Goolsby and Anderson, 1964), and a full-scale waterflood was installed in the early 1960's. There have been two phases of infilf drilling, an initial phase from 1971 through 1973 and a later phase from 1975 to 1977. lnfill-wells changed the waterflood patterns from the previous 40-acre 5-spots to 40-acre inverted 9-spots. Oil production dropped sharply in late 1977, and a stabilized decline of approximately 8 percent per year began.\n\nThe\n\nType log of J. T.

A broad spectrum of deposits, ranging from shoreline and inner-shelf (or inner-ramp) sediments on the west to slightly deeper-water marine-shelf (or outer-ramp) environments toward the east, accumulated along the eastern portion of the Central Basin Platform fronting the Midland Basin. The depositional slope across the portion of the shelf that now composes the field was gradual, possibly interrupted only by bars of carbonate sand or local reefs. Longacre (1 983) has shown that a thick shelf-margin reef section, equivalent to the Grayburg Formation, is present along W E PERMEABILITY BARRIER QUEEN GRAYBURG SAN ANDRES FIGURE 5.

Continued regression resulted in evaporitic deposlts forming both updip and overlying seals. The updip permeability barrier that defines the western edge of the field is due to evaporite plugging of porosity in dolostones as well as to bedded evaporites. a portion of the easternmost boundary of the North McElroy Unit. But the continuity of the reef elsewhere along the margin of the Central Basin Platform has yet to be proven, and the reef interval does not contribute to the reservoir in North McElroy field.\n\nMcElroy field is a combination stratigraphicstructural trap. The field is now positioned along a north-trending asymmetrical anticline with a steeply dipping eastern limb and a more gently dipping western limb (fig. 2). Relief on the top of the Grayburg Formation, exceeding 1,000 ft on the east flank and 200 ft on the west, was not present at the time of deposition, as shown by lithofacies distribution and stratigraphic reconstruction. Regional isopach maps of the Grayburg and overlying strata show the timing of folding for the asymmetric structure to be post-Grayburg but still Permian in age (during deposition of the upper part of the Queen Formation and of the Seven Rivers Formation).\n\nThe top of the pay zone occurs at 2,620 ft in the central portion of the field, deepens to 3,000 ft toward the west, and increases to 3,800 ft to the east. Gross thickness of the producing interval is 400 ft, and total thickness of producing zones varies across the field from 80 to 250 ft. A stratigraphic permeability barrier caused by a facies change and an increase in the amount of porosity-plugging evaporites defines the western edge of the field, whereas the eastern boundary of the reservoir is limited by a gradual reduction of permeability coupled with an increase in water saturation.\n\nOil produced from McElroy field is naphthenic (fig. 6), has 32\" API gravity, and has 2 weight-percent sulfur and 6 to 7 percent H,S. Shales and shaly siltstones of the Lower Permian (Wolfcamp Formation) beneath the Midland Basin are ,suspected to be the primary source, on the basis of their organic contents and maturity. However, the oil-source correlation has not yet been established by organic geochemical data. Thus far, the organic geochemical data can only prove a source that is younger than the Mississippian Woodford Formation.\n\nAverage total organic carbon (TOC) for the Wolfcamp, an interval more than 1,000 ft thick, is 1.0 to 1.5 percent; maximum TOC is 2.0 percent. The kerogen type is undetermined and structureless; vitrinite reflectance has an R, of 1.0 to 1.4. Depth to McElroy Unit. In contrast, Harris and others (1 984) the top of the Wolfcamp is approximately 7,000 ft proposed a more generalized facies subdivision of beneath McElroy field, with maximum burial perhaps the McElroy field. We use this more generalized facies 1,500 ft deeper reached at the end of the Mesozoic scheme of open-shelf, shallow-water shelf, and shal-(fig. 7). The Wolfcamp Formation is thicker and low shelf-to-intertidal facies (figs. 5 and 8) because 1,000 ft or more deeper to the east in the Midland the scale of the units is such that they are conelat-Basin.\n\nable by both core and log methods and are probably more apt to be used by engineers during reservoir modeling.\n\nThe Grayburg carbonate shelf deposits are anhydritic dolostones that become increasingly evapo-Stratigraphic relations within McElroy field have ritic and silty toward the top of a upward-shoaling been discussed by Longacre (1 980, 1983Longacre (1 980, , 1986)), sequence. Dolostones are commonly finely crystal- Harris and others (1984). and Walker and Harris line, anhedral to subhedral, interlocking crystal rno-(1986). Longacre (1980)   Coarsely crystalline anhydrite is ubiquitous, occludes moldic, vugular, and intercrystalline pores, and also occurs as nodules. Gypsum, bassanite (an unstable, hemihydrated phase of calcium sulfate), and authigenic quartz are also present in the dolostone in minor amounts.\n\nThe uppermost Grayburg and lower Queen Formations include tight, low-porosity tidal-flat and terrigenous clastic deposits that form the seal over the Grayburg shelf deposits (fig. 9A). Anhydrite occurs with mosaic texture or as isolated nodules that have displaced the surrounding sediment. Quartz siltstone and fine-grained sandstones, which are sometimes reddish, are tightly cemented by anhydrite and dolomite. The siltstones, along with gray-green silty dolomudstones, contain argillaceous material and finely dispersed pyrite. Dolostones are variable in texture and grain composition but are characterized by pisolites, intraclasts, desiccation cracks, collapse breccia, algal laminae, and fenestral porosity. Hairline fractures in dolopackstones/dolograinstones are commonly healed by anhydrite; nonetheless, minor microfracture and fenestral porosity remain.\n\nThe Queen Formation normally exhibits a pronounced gamma-ray variation. It is not unusual to have streaks of greater than 120 APl 'units, and the jagged nature of the gamma-ray curve reflects the interbedded nature of the Queen (fig. 10). A natural gamma-ray spectroscopy log shows that high gammaray peaks result from elevated potassium and thorium values, and log-to-core correlations show that these peaks correlate with silty layers in the Queen. In contrast, dolostones in this part of the section have low levels of radioactivity. Gamma-ray response in the Grayburg is largely due to elevated uranium values in the dolostones, and less so to thin siltstones in the upper portion of the interval. Core studies in McElroy field indicate that the thin siltstones of the Grayburg are not laterally continuous. However, their continuity and therefore their value as correlation markers apparently increases along trend to the north where, in Dune field, some of the major siltstones are recognizable in wells 10 mi apart (Bebout, 1986; Bebout and others, 1987).\n\nThe shallow shelf-to-intertidal unit is heterogeneous in depositional textures and contains intraclast, fusulinid, and ooid dolograinstones interbedded with dolomudstones, burrowed dolowackestones, and minor quartz siltstone (fig. 96). These deposits pinch out toward the west end of the field into tidal-flat and terrigenous clastic facies. Along the crest of the present-day structure, the best porosity and permeability observed in any lithofacies throughout the field occur in ooid and peloid dolograinstones of shallow shelf-to-intertidal origin. The porosity is predominantly interparticle; similar dolograinstones are cemented with anhydrite off the crest of the structure in the field, suggesting that solution of evaporites and enlargement of interparticle pores may have contributed to the porosity in the dolograinstones along the crest.\n\nThe electric-log character of the shallow shelf-tointertidal deposits is as variable as the lithology (fig. 8). Lateral facies changes and interfingering with the overlying siltier sediments make correlation of the unit difficult without core. Both upper and lower contacts are gradational; however the upper contact with low-porosity sands and anhydrite is easier to pick than the lower change to porous shallow-water shelf dolostones.\n\nThe shallow shelf is characterized by burrowed dolowackestones and dolopackstones containing pelecypods and peloids (fig. 9C, 9D). On the basis of depositional textures, grain types, and sedimentary structures observed in cores, shallow shelf lithofacies are interpreted to have formed in a slightly more agitated environment relative to the underlying openshelf facies. Gradual changes in shallow shelf lithologies occur across the field. From west to east, homogeneous dolomudstones with scattered pelecypods and echinoid fragments become more fossiliferous with the addition of bryozoans and green algae. These sediments are still mud-supported, suggesting little current activity. However, on the structural crest and east flank of the field, local grainsupported intervals suggest an increase in bottom agitation. Porosity types are intercrystalline, vuggy, and moldic after pelecypod shells; porosities decrease toward the western edge of the field owing to evaporite plugging.\n\nSmaller patch reefs or mounds described by Longacre (1983) and Harris and others (1984) contribute only locally to the reservoir interval in McElroy field in both the shallow shelf and underlying open-shelf portions of the Grayburg section. Sponges, algae, bryozoans, Tubiphytes, and fibrous marine cements form the framework for the small patch reefs or mounds. The original porosity within this framework has subsequently been occluded by evaporites. The carbonate sands associated with the reef are commonly peloidal dolograinstones and dolopackstones. Only minor porosity remains in the sands as anhydrite, and, less commonly, gypsum fills most interparticle, fracture, and vuggy porosities.\n\nOpen-shelf deposits of the basal Grayburg Formation include dolowackestones and dolopackstones and, less commonly, doloboundstones (patch reefs with associated carbonate sands). Dolowackestones and dolopackstones of the open shelf are burrowed mixtures of peloids and fusulinids (fig. 9E, 9F). Fusulinid molds sometimes contribute to porosity but more typically are filled with anhydrite. Reservoir zones within the open-shelf facies occur in dolomitized muds; these may occur as dolomudstones, dolowackestones, or even matrix in dolopackstones. Porosity types include interparticle between peloids, . ow WELL N0.638 B WELL NO. 1 1 3 Y ..a h . , . The open-shelf facies thickens slightly on the east flank of the field where it is in gradational contact with the overlying shallow shelf (fig. 8). The contact is difficult to pick on wireline logs. In contrast, the same contact is more abrupt in the western portions of the field and can be identified easily on gamma-ray logs. Log identification is possible because the open shelf is cleaner and has a lower gamma count than the overlying shallow shelf (figs. 3 and 10). The neutron porosity logs indicate that porosities are higher in the shallow shelf than in the open shelf, and a gradual reduction of porosity occurs with depth.\n\nThe depositional sequence recognized in cores from McElroy field formed in a shallow shelf (inner ramp) and related tidal-flat and evaporitic (sabkha) setting (fig. 11). The facies developed during easterly progradation across a deeper-water open shelf (outer ramp). Core data and depositional models of other fields along the trend (Yates field by Adams, 1930, Donoghue andGupton, 1957, and Craig and others, 1'986; Foster field by Young and Vaughn, 1957; Dune field by Bebout, 1986, andBebout andothers, 1987; Means field by George andStiles, 1978, 1986) suggest that major portions of the eastern margin of the Central Basin Plalform were dominated by similar depositional facies systems in which carbonate sand-shoal and updip tidal-flat facies belts were important.\n\nToward the end of Grayburg deposition, carbonate production was gradually terminated by the rapid advance from the west of silts and evaporites of the uppermost Grayburg and Queen Formations.\n\nA gradational change occurs in cores from McElroy field from carbonates to siliciclastics and evaporites updip and upsection. The upper Grayburg is typically a silty, anhydritic dolostone marking the upper portions of an upward-shoaling depositional sequence that is recognized in McElroy and other fields along the trend (Garber and Harris, 1986). Bartel and Broomhall (1986) described a similar progradational situation in the San Andres Formation in Means FIGURE 9. Core photographs of various llthofacies, McElroy 109 well. b A.

Other porosity types are also important to production where they occur in conjunction with the intercrystalline porosity (figs. 12 and 13); rnoldic porosity is common in dolowackestones and packstones, and vugular and fracture porosity are present in portions of the field. Although quite variable, the average porosity is 9 percent and the average permeability is 2.5 md. Capillary pressure measurements indicate that porosity observed in thin sections alone is a poor indicator of reservoir potential because of variations in permeability and pore-throat size. Permeability variation is related to depositional texture, crystal size of dolomite crystals, and porosity Irregularly shaped, smaller than 10 pm in diameter with pore throat diameters less than 1 pm, and dead-ended. The pore cast was made by injecting plastic resin Into the oil-extracted sample at 1,500 psi and dissolving away the carbonate rock is located in matrix areas away from carbonate grains. Epoxy pore casts show that these small, intercrystalline pores are highly irregular in shape and moderately well connected. Less common are intercrystalline pores with minimum pore throat diameters of approximately 5 pm. These intercrystalline pores are located immediately adjacent to carbonate grains (peloids and ooids), are more regular in shape, and are moderately well interconnected. A peloidal texture was sometimes apparent in pore cast but not in a thin section of the same sample. A third minor type of intercrystalline pore occurs only in the nuclei of ooids. This microporosity is less than 1 prn in diameter and is surrounded by a much less porous rim consisting of dense interlocking dolomite crystals. Moldic pore space is the second most common pore type. Although these pores are larger than the intercrystalline pores (diameters of approximately 100 pm), they add to the effective pore volume only if connected by intercrystalline pore space. Most of the moldic pores are elongate to round and represent leached fossils and peloids. Where moldic pores are truly isolated, measured permeabilities are low and pore casts are difficult to make.\n\nTwo types of vugular pores are recognized: (1) large, irregularly shaped pores located between dolomite crystals (greater than 50 pm diameters) and\n\n(2) small, irregularly shaped pores located within dolomite crystals (1 to 2 pm diameters). The smaller vugular pores formed by the partial dissolution of dolomite crystals. The larger vugular pores, on the other hand, may represent solution enlargement of moldic pores and dissolution of evaporite nodules.\n\nDistribution of absolute permeability in individually measured samples ranges from 0.01 md to 2 darcys. Microscopic heterogeneity of permeability distribution reflects dolomite crystal size and sorting, dissolution of carbonate grains and sulfates, and the varying pore types discussed previously, whereas macroscopic heterogeneity across the field results from facies changes and the accompanying variation of depositional texture. Porosity occlusion by evaporites is apparently more extensive on the flanks of the structure than along the crest; the development of vugular porosity, conversely, is more common along the crest of the structure. As a result of these variations, the trend is for the more permeable interval to thicken toward the center of the field. Recovery efficiency under both primary and secondary operations improves in the center of the field, as does the pay quality. Cumulative-production I data indicate that maximum production has been from wells in the center of the field that are situated along the crest of the structure (fig. 14).\n\nReservoir performance of any stratigraphic interval varies throughout the field as the quality of the pay interval changes. Reservoir zones thin toward the eastern side of the field and pinch out to the west. Interbedded nonporous zones separate the reservoir vertically throughout the entire field and make correlation of pay zones and prediction of continuity between wells difficult (figs. 15 and 16). Shallow Shelf deposits are relatively homogeneous and unstratified, and vertical continuity within this zone is good, despite localized nonporous zones due to evaporite cementation. The overlying shallow shelf-to-intertidal deposits are stratified and show abrupt lithological variation vertically and horizontally.\n\nThe importance of evaporite facies as updip seals in reservoirs like McElroy cannot be overstated. Oil discovered in Guadalupian strata throughout the Permian Basin is found primarily at the boundary between updip evaporites and associated shelf dolostones or siliciclastics (Ward and others, 1986). At McElroy field, the reservoir is overlain and passes updip into an impermeable anhydrite, halite, siltstone,\n\nContour interval= 5 percent RECOVERY FACTORS .xsw Highest Lowest FIGURE 14.

Waterflood response, as shown for part of the field (fig. 17), reflects these facies changes. Incremental waterflood response and average resetvoir pressure are greater immediately downdip of this evaporite boundary in the field. Anhydrites and locally impermeable dolomites of the underlying San Andres Formation similarly restrict the lower extent of the productive oil column.\n\nProduction in McElroy field is complicated locally by larger-scale permeability patterns. After the beginning of the waterflood, abnormally high water production could be traced to direct communication between injection and producing wells. Log and core studies have confirmed that fractures are present in McElroy field, and engineering data suggest that the fractures cause the high production in certain wells. These fractures are both natural and induced, the latter having formed during overinjection or by treatments to stimulate production.\n\nRecovering the most oil possible from large reservoirs like McElroy field by using better enhancedrecovery techniques is vital. Plans for continued development of the reservoir focus on improving the current waterflood by more careful evaluation of reservoir continuity using geological models and reservoir engineering data. Further study of the orientation and magnitude of permeability *channeling\" is necessary to aid remedial work intended to direct more injected water into unswept zones. Fluid-injection profiles are being modified on certain water injection wells through polymer treatments, and an increase in the volume of injected water into \"tighter\" zones is intended to provide waterflood support in portions of the field where poor vertical sweep efficiency has made the flood ineffective.
