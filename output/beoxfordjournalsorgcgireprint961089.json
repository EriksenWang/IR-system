    "abstract": "The 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in eukaryotes may occur either interspersed with the other rRNA genes in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat, or in separate tandem arrays, or dispersed throughout the genome. In Pythium species and in several related Oomycetes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) region with one primer specific for the 5S gene revealed, with several exceptions, that the 5S rRNA gene was present in the rDNA repeat of those species with filamentous sporangia and was absent from the rDNA repeat of those with globose or unknown sporangia. When present, the gene was located -1 kb downstream of the large-subunit rRNA gene and on the strand opposite that on which the other rRNA genes were located. This was confirmed in P. torulosum by sequencing of the gene and its flanking regions. The 5S rRNA genes ofP. ultimum were found in tandem arrays outside the rDNA repeat. Evidence of dispersed 5S rRNA sequences was also observed. For many of the species of Pythium having the 5S gene in the NTS, the region between the large-subunit rRNA gene and the 5S gene was found to have length heterogeneity.\nOomycetes related to Pythium were also found to have the 5S gene in the NTS, although sometimes in the opposite orientation. This may mean that the presence of the gene in the NTS is ancestral for the Oomycetes and that the absence of the gene in the NTS in those Pythiums with globose sporangia is due to loss of the gene from the rDNA repeat in an ancestor of this group of species. These results favor the view that 5S rRNA gene linkage to the rRNA cistron existed prior to the unlinked arrangement seen in most plants and animals.",
    "full_text": "In eukaryotes the nuclear 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are relatively independent of the other rRNA genes. They are transcribed separately and may or may not be part of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat unit (reviewed in Gerbi 1985). In plants and animals the 5S rRNA genes are generally organized into tandem arrays unlinked to the rDNA repeat unit (Brown and Sugimoto 1973;Hemleben and Grierson 1978;Gerlach and Dyer 1980;Benes and Cave 1985 ) . In Neurosporu UUSS~ and in several other ascomycetous fungi, the 5S genes are dispersed throughout the genome in a complex manner (Selker et al. 198 1;Mao et al. 1982;Bartnik et al. 1986). In other fungi, a 5S gene is embedded in the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) of the rDNA repeat unit. This is true for a diverse collection of fungi including Ascomycetes (Kramer et al. 1978;Tabata 1980;Amici and Rollo 199 1) , Basidiomycetes (Cassidy and Pukkila 1987;Duchesne and Anderson 1990)) a Zygomycete (Cihlar and Sypherd 1980)) and 1. Key words: 5S ribosomal RNA gene, nontranscribed spacer, ribosomal DNA repeat, DNA heterogeneity.\n\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Glen R. Klassen an Oomycete (Rosek and Timberlake 1979). In Dictyostelium the 5s gene is also linked to the other rRNA genes (Maizels 1976).\n\nObviously, the 5s rRNA gene family has been rearranged during eukaryote evolution. Which of the three arrangements outlined above is most like the original one? More specifically, have 5s genes become unlinked to the rDNA repeat in the course of gene dispersion (Clark and Gerbi 1982)) or have 5s genes become linked to the rDNA repeat in some fungi and protozoa during adaptation for tighter control of ribosome synthesis (Clark 1987 )? These questions might be answered if we had a system in which the change from one arrangement to the other was in process. We have discovered that both linked and unlinked 5s genes exist in the oomycete genus Pythium, and we expect that this system will be useful in approaching questions of 5s gene-family change. In this report we describe the 5s gene-family arrangement in the two types of Pythium and survey the genus and other related genera for 5s gene presence and organization.\n\nOomycetes, although rightly considered, on the basis of nutrition and mycelial form, to be fungi, have been shown, on the basis of rRNA gene sequences, to be unrelated to the true fungi (Gunderson et al. 1987;Forster et al. 1990). It has also been shown that the structure of the NTS in P. ultimum, with its arrays of subrepeats, is like that in plants and not like that in fungi ( Klassen and Buchko 1990). Thus, our report extends knowledge of 5s rRNA gene organization into a relatively unexplored part of the phylogenetic world.\n\nIsolates of Pythium species and other Oomycetes were obtained from the Aquatic Phycomycete Culture Collection ( APCC), Reading, U.K., as well as from the Biosystematics Research Centre, Ottawa (see table 1). DNA was extracted from all the isolates according to a method described elsewhere (Kim et al. 1990). The DNA was digested with endonucleases according to the supplier's instructions (GIBCO BRL Life Technologies, Inc.). Agarose gels were blotted and hybridized with 32P-labeled pMF2, a recombinant plasmid having an insert composed of the gene region of the rDNA repeat of Neurospora crassa (Free et al. 1979), and with 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Maniatis et al. 1982, p. 11.3 1) . The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al. 1988) was done according to a method described elsewhere (Buchko and Klassen 1990), using the following oligonucleotide primers: H (dCTTCGATGTCGGCTCTTC\n\n), P2 (dATACTTAGACA-TGCATGGC), and G (dCCAAGAATTTCACCTCTGAC). Except for Y2, the sequences of all primers not previously described are within gene-coding regions and were based on published 5s rRNA sequences ( Wolters and Erdmann 1988). Y2 is in the spacer (NTS) region and was based on our own sequence data. Many of the amplifications reported in the present paper are unusually long, and, although the method is detailed in a previously published paper (Buchko and Klassen 1990)) it is important to realize that such amplifications are the result of painstaking optimization of primer concentration and cycling conditions. It is especially important to optimize the number of cycles of PCR performed; we find that we can rarely exceed 20 cycles. Doublestranded PCR products were sequenced directly from at least two independently amplified templates according to a method described elsewhere (Hausner et al. 1992).\n\nLocation and Orientation of the 5s rRNA Genes in Pythium torulosum A physical map of the rDNA repeat unit in P. torulosum has been reported elsewhere (Klassen et al. 1987) and now is presented again, showing more restriction sites, gene placement, and primer sites, for the present study (fig. 1;McNabb 1989). A 5s gene was located in the NTS region by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides designed to recognize conserved regions within 5s genes. Amplification with primer pairs QN, YP, and QP resulted in products of 1.25, 3.35, and 4.6 kb, respectively. Use of primer pairs NP and QY did not yield amplification products. These results mean that a 5s gene is located 1.25 kb downstream of the Q primer site and that it is coded on the DNA strand opposite to the one on which the other rRNA genes are found; that is, it is in the \"inverted\" orientation. The region between the large-subunit rRNA ( LSrRNA) gene and the 5s gene is designated as \"NTS 1,\" and the region between the 5s gene and the small-subunit rRNA ( SSrRNA) gene as \"NTS2\" (Planta and Rau6 1988). We have located a 5s gene in the rDNA repeat of P. torulosum; but other 5s genes may occur elsewhere in the genome, and it may be that not all of the rDNA repeats include the gene.\n\nWith PCR products QN, QN2, YP, and Y2P used as templates and with primers N, N2, Y, and Y2 used as sequencing primers, the sequence of the 5s gene and its flanking regions was determined (fig. 2). Except for the NZ primer region, the gene has been sequenced from both strands, and each flanking region twice from the same strand. The ends of the 5s rRNA product of the putative coding region were not sequenced, but, when the sequence was compared with the published 5s rRNA sequence of P. hydnosporum (Walker and Doolittle 1982), only two base substitutions were observed (T+C at position 39 and A-G at position 107). Thus, the extent of the 5s rRNA gene coding region is based on this assumed homology.\n\nDetection of 5s rRNA Genes in Other Pythium Species and Related Organisms Amplification with QN and QY primer pairs was attempted with template DNA from 45 isolates of Pythium, representing at least 27 different species, as well as from 6 representatives from other oomycete groups (table 1). Three types of results were obtained. Successful amplification with QN was taken to mean that the 5s gene was likely to be present in the rDNA repeat and that it was in the inverted orientation. Successful amplification with QY was taken to mean that the gene was also likely to be present, but in the other orientation. In no case was amplification observed with both primer pairs. Amplification with neither of the primer pairs was due either to some problem with the assay or to the gene's absence from the rDNA repeat. When more than one isolate of the same species was investigated, the same results were obtained, except for minor differences in the sizes of fragments produced. In many of the amplifications, multiple bands were produced, ranging in size from 0.95 to 2.4 kb. All of the amplification products reported in table 1 were hybridized to a 5s rRNAspecific probe, to show that they contain 5s rRNA sequences. QN products were hybridized to Y3 primer, and QY products to N2 primer (data not shown, except for those in fig. 5).\n\nIn general, Pythium species with filamentous sporangia had the 5s gene in the\n\nTable 1 Presence and Absence of 5s rRNA Sequences in the rDNA Repeat of Pythium Isolates and Related Oomycetes Isolatea Band Size (s) Zoosporangial QNPCR QY PCR (kb) Form Pythium coloratum BR483 Pythium coloratum BR323 Pythium diclinum 4110a Pythium sulcatum BRl51 Pythium pachycaule 4117b Pythium vanterpoolii 42 13a Pythium torulosum 4212e Pythium arrhenomanes 4201~ Pythium arrhenomanes BR607 Pythium graminicola BR608 Pythium graminicola BR166 Pythium aristosporum BR 136 Pythium sp.

Exceptions were P. periplocum ( filamentous but with no 5s in rDNA), P. hypogynum and P. salpingophorum (globose but with 5s in rDNA), and P. violae (unknown sporangial type but with 5s in rDNA). All Pythium species that had the gene in the rDNA repeat had it in the inverted orientation. Two isolates of Phytophthora cryptogea, as well as Achlya klebsiana, were found to have the 5s gene in the noninverted orientation, but Lagenidium giganteum, Verrucalvusf2avofaciew and Pachymetra chaunorhiza had the inverted orientation just like the Pythium samples.\n\n5s rRNA Sequences Outside the rDNA Repeat in P. ultimum 5s rRNA sequences were not found in any P. ultimum isolates by the method described above. To locate the P. ultimum 5s genes outside the rDNA repeat, genomic DNA from two isolates (BR4 18, isolated from alfalfa in Ontario, and BR600, isolated from bean in British Columbia) was digested simultaneously with HincII and EcoRV. The blotted profiles were hybridized to pMF2, a plasmid containing the rRNA genes of Neurospora crassa (Free et al. 1979), and to 5s rRNA-specific oligonucleotides Y and N2 (fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 4). These pMFZprobed profiles have been presented elsewhere (Klassen and Buchko 1990) and are included here for comparison. The profiles generated by the Y probe (fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 5 ) and the N2 probe (fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6) consisted of prominant bands at 2.2 kb and of numerous minor bands larger and smaller than 2.2 kb. The 2.2-kb band did not correspond to any one of the bands from the rDNA repeat and thus is not part of the rDNA repeat, since the entire repeat is accounted for in the bands hybridizing to pMF2 (Klassen and Buchko 1990). The two different 5s rRNA-specific probes produced identical profiles, indicating that all of the bands actually contain 5s rRNA or 5s rRNA-like sequences, because it is unlikely that two different probes would produce the same artifacts or nonspecific hybridization patterns. We also observed that, when genomic DNA from P. ultimum BR47 1 was digested separately with HincII, EcoRI, ClaI, and KpnI, prominent 2.2kb bands were produced in each case (fig. 3B). This was interpreted to mean that most of the 5s RNA genes of P. ultimum are found in an array having a periodicity of 2.2 kb, with single sites for EcoRI, ClaI, KpnI, and HincII. [The 2.2-kb band generated by the HincII+ EcoRV digestion is due to HincII digestion alone (fig. 3B).] More than one 5s rRNA gene may be present in each repeat unit. Although the major 2.2-kb band was conserved in different P. ultimum isolates, most of the minor bands were not. This could mean that 5S rRNA or 5S rRNA-like sequences found outside the major array are being rearranged rapidly during subspecific evolution.\n\nThe aforementioned strong evidence for the 5s rRNA gene's absence from the rDNA of P. ultimum could be obtained because of knowledge of the detailed physical map of the rDNA repeat unit in this species. For the other species that apparently lack the 5S gene in their rDNA, this level of evidence must await detailed knowledge of the physical maps of their rDNA repeats. For 8 of the 13 species in this category, however, we have other supporting evidence for the absence of the 5S gene in their rDNA. The entire NTS was amplified using primers located at the 3' end of the LSrRNA gene and at the 5' end of the SSrRNA gene, yielding products ranging in size from 4 to 5.5 kb (fig. 4A). These products were hybridized to the ribosomal probe pMF2 to show that they contain the expected ribosomal sequences and thus are not something else (fig. 4B). Finally, the products were hybridized to the SS-specific probe Y (fig. 4C). No hybridization was observed either to the PCR products from the eight species tested or to products derived from P. ultimum. The two products from P. toulosum and P. gruminicola (fig. 4C, lanes 12 and 13)) however, showed strong hybridization, consistent with the presence of the 5S gene in the target DNA. We were not able to amplify the NTS region from the five species that remain untested, and thus the conclusion that the 5S gene is absent in these cases should be seen as tentative, Heterogeneous Amplification Products from IGR 1 When multiple bands were generated by QN or QY amplification (table 1 ), this was taken as preliminary evidence of template heterogeneity. Almost half of the successful amplifications shown in table 1 produced multiple bands, indicating that heterogeneity of the NTSl region could be common in Oomycetes. Although it was shown that all of the multiple fragments that were reported contained 5S rRNA sequences (see above), the production of multiple amplification products does not prove template heterogeneity. To do so would require detailed physical maps for each isolate, so P. vanterpoolii 42 13a was chosen as a test case (fig. 5). Amplification with the QN2 primer pair produced a set of three fragments, as reported in table 1. To show that the three bands were not likely to be artifacts, amplification with the HN2 primer pair was also done, producing a set of fragments each 250 bp larger than the corresponding fragment produced by QN2 amplification, as predicted by the map (fig. 1). All of these bands were recognized by the 5s rRNA-specific probe Y. To show that the genomic template had the same pattern of heterogeneity, DNA from P. vanterpoolii was digested with AvaI+ClaI and hybridized to the oligonucleotide Y3. If it is assumed that the physical map of the rDNA repeat in P. vanterpoolii was similar to that in P. torulosum (fig. 1)) then this digestion should produce a fragment including all of NTS 1. Three bands in the profile were recognized by the probe. The three bands have the same ratio of sizes as do the PCR products from this region, and even the same relative intensities. The fragments are a little larger than expected on the basis of the map, indicating that P. vanterpoolii and P. torulosum differ with respect to the location of a ClaI site at the 3' end of the LSrRNA gene.\n\nWe have discovered two fundamentally different genomic locations for the 5s rRNA gene family within the same genus. In most Pythium species that have filamentous sporangia (Dick 1990)) the 5s gene is found in the NTS region of the rDNA repeat unit, inverted with respect to the other genes. In most other Pythium speciesthose with globose or absent sporangia-the 5s gene family appears to be absent from the rDNA repeat unit. In P. ultimum, we have shown that the gene is indeed absent from the rDNA repeat and that the 5s gene family occurs in arrays that are unlinked to the other rRNA genes, similar to the arrangement in plants and animals. [Several invertebrates have been reported to have linked 5s genes (Drouin et al. 1987;Vahidi et al. 1988) .] In Succharomyces cerevisiae a tandem array of variant 5s sequences has been reported, but most of the 5s genes are part of the rDNA repeat unit, and the variant cluster, although probably expressed, may be dispensable (McMahon et al. 1984).\n\nPythium ultimum also appears to have dispersed 5s sequences, perhaps similar to those reported in Neurosporu crassa (Selker et al. 198 1) and other filamentous Ascomycetes (Mao et al, 1982;Bartnik et al. 1986). Evidence of the dispersed sequences may be seen in Southern blots of genomic DNA, which show complex patterns of bands reproducible by hybridization to two different SS-specific probes. Whereas the dominant 2.2-kb tandem family is conserved between geographically distant isolates of P. ultimum, polymorphism of the minor-band patterns indicates that dispersed There is no obvious shared character that would distinguish them from the others in this group. Pythium species for which sporangia are not known also tend not to have the 5s gene in the rDNA repeat. The exception is P. violae, which is atypical in having extremely large oospores (Dick 1990). Many of the other species in this group (sporangia not known) are morphologically similar to the group of Pythium species with globose sporangia (Van der Plaats-Niterink 198 1; Dick 1990). In spite of exceptions, the findings appear to be significant when it is noted that the evolutionary relationships within the genus have not yet been resolved. Zoosporangial form is only one character among many used in Pythium taxonomy, and it is surprising that it should be predictive for 5s rRNA gene location. It should also be kept in mind that the negative PCR results may be due, in isolated cases, to a failure of the reaction, rather than to absence of the 5s gene. It is unlikely that failure to amplify would be due to lack of specificity of the primers, because the primers do work with much more distantly related oomycete species, such as Phytophthora cryptogea, Achlya klebsiana, and others (table 1) .\n\nIn many cases, amplification of the NTS region yielded multiple bands, especially in NTSl. Although, without further investigation of each case, it is impossible to be sure that these reflect heterogeneity in template DNA, we have shown, for one arbitrarily chosen species (P. vanterpoolii), that the PCR bands match Southern blots, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Similar faithfulness of PCR in reproducing template heterogeneity has been demonstrated elsewhere (Buchko and Klassen 1990). The presence of heterogeneity in this region of the rDNA repeat suggests that this region of the repeat is susceptible to rearrangement. In P. ultimum, the corresponding region is also highly heterogeneous (Klassen and Buchko 1990)) but the 5s gene is absent. Loss (or gain) of the 5s gene in this region of the rDNA repeat may well be related to these sequence characteristics.\n\nOur limited survey of Oomycetes shows that the predominant location for the 5s gene may be the rDNA repeat. Pythium species with globose or unknown sporangia are the only exceptions at this time. This distribution of this character suggests that the absence of the gene in the rDNA repeat is a derived character within the Oomycetes; the ancestor of the Pythium species with globose sporangia has lost the 5s gene in the course of evolution. Whether this was a local phenomenon confined to oomycete evolution or a general trend also operational in the evolution of plants and animals is not known at this time. If it is a general phenomenon, then Clark's ( 1987) concept of primitive unlinked rRNA genes would not be supported.\n\nThe orientation of the 5s gene, although consistent within the genus Pythium (\"inverted\"), is not conserved for Oomycetes. Phytophthora cryptogea, which, of the Oomycetes included in the present study, is believed to be the one most closely related to Pythium, has the opposite orientation, while Lagenidium giganteum, more distantly related, has the same orientation. Similar variation is found within the Saprolegniales (Achlya klebsiana, Pachymetra chaunorhiza, and Verrucalvus jlavofaciens) . In Coprinus, both orientations have been reported within the one genus (Cassidy and Pukkila 1987). The variability found may be another indication that the 5s gene region is susceptible to rearrangement.\n\nThese results lead to the following speculation: If it is assumed that the primordial eukaryotic 5s gene was linked to the other rRNA genes and that this arrangement survived in many fungi, in a few invertebrates, in Pythium species with filamentous sporangia, and in other Oomycetes, two patterns of 5s gene dispersion (unlinking) can be imagined. The fungal pattern would consist of both loss of the gene from the rDNA repeat and a general scattering of copies throughout the genome, as seen in N. crassa (Selker et al. 198 1). The separate ancestors of animals, plants, and Oomycetes would lose the 5s gene from the rDNA repeat but then would assemble copies into tandem arrays. The capacity to form arrays instead of dispersals may be due to the structure of the NTS around the 5S gene before dispersion. Lack of repetitive elements in the fungal NTS may leave the dispersed 5s copies without the potential for forming arrays, while presence of repetitive elements in the NTSs of animals, plants, and oomycetes (Klassen and Buchko 1990) may have allowed array formation. We are pursuing studies of the 5s sequence arrays in Pythium species with globose sporangia, to see whether their spacer (NTS) sequences have repetitive elements similar to those in the NTS of the rDNA repeat and from which they may have been derived.\n\nby guest on October 27, 2014 http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from\n\nby guest on October 27, 2014 http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from\n\nELIZABETH A.
