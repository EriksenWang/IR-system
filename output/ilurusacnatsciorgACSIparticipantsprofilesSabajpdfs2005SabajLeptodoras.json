    "abstract": "The genus Leptodoras Boulenger is a monophyletic assemblage of at least ten species distributed in large, predominantly lowland rivers throughout the northern half of cis-Andean South America. Leptodoras is diagnosed in Doradidae (thorny catfishes) by unique morphologies of the oral hood (upper labial extensions distinct with comparatively smooth ventral surface, lateral margins of extensions entire, weakly scalloped or fimbriate and without marginal papillae, and interlabial membranes of narrow or moderate width), first gill arch (enlarged accessory lamellae extend well onto medial face of gill filaments), and gas bladder (reduced size and modified cordiform shape, two distinct horn-like diverticula project from posterior walls of posterior chambers, and a pair of bulbous diverticula project from lateral walls of anterior chamber). Examination of specimens of Leptodoras from throughout its range verified the distinctiveness of the seven nominal species (L. acipenserinus, L. copei, L. hasemani, L. juruensis, L. linnelli, L. myersi and L. praelongus) and revealed three new species described herein (Leptodoras nelsoni, L. rogersae, and L. cataniai). A lectotype for L. hasemani is designated.\nO gênero Leptodoras Boulenger é um agrupamento monofilético com pelo menos dez espécies, distribuídas em rios grandes e predominantemente de terras baixas na metade norte da região cis-Andina da América do Sul.

    "full_text": "Leptodoras Boulenger (longlip thornycats) is a monophyletic genus of the Doradidae (Order Siluriformes) comprised of seven previously described and three new species distributed in large, predominantly lowland rivers throughout the northern half of cis-Andean South America. Leptodoras is easily recognized by its long conical snout and well-developed oral hood formed by the membranous union of maxillary barbels, paired jaw barbels and labial structures. The oral hood presumably facilitates the detection and suction-feeding of shallowly buried invertebrates. Stomach contents typically include chironomid larvae, sand and detritus (pers. obs.).\n\nMost species of Leptodoras are truly benthic and typically inhabit the deep swift-flowing waters of large rivers. Like most fimbriate-barbel doradids many species of Leptodoras migrate at dusk into shallow waters near shore to forage over beaches and shoals of sand or silt. Other species of Leptodoras (e.g., L. juruensis, L. myersi) appear more restricted to deep channel habitats and are best captured via bottom trawls at depths of up to 50 m (J.G. Lundberg, unpubl. data). Leptodoras is not known from elevations exceeding 500 m above sea level and most records are from below 200 m. Species are distributed throughout lowlands in the Orinoco, Amazon and Tocantins basins and several coastal river systems (e.g., Essequibo) that enter the Atlantic between the\n\nmouths of the Orinoco and Amazon. Leptodoras is not known from trans-Andean drainages (e.g., Maracaibo and Magdalena) or Atlantic-slope drainages south of the rio Tocantins (e.g., rios São Francisco and Paraná-Paraguay).\n\nThe taxonomic history of Leptodoras dates back to Günther's (1868a) description of Oxydoras acipenserinus from the Peruvian Amazon. Boulenger (1898) subsequently proposed the genus Leptodoras, designated L. acipenserinus the type, and described a second species, L. juruensis, from the rio Jurua, Brazil. Boulenger (1898) distinguished Leptodoras as having a longer body and longer anal fin (15 to 17 rays) than Oxydoras Kner. Eigenmann (1912) doubted the diagnosability of Leptodoras based on anal-fin ray counts, but retained Leptodoras as distinct because of its lack of teeth. Eigenmann (1912) introduced a third species, L. linnelli, described from the Essequibo river basin, Guyana. Steindachner (1915) described Hemidoras hasemani based on 18 syntypes from the rio Branco and one specimen, reidentified here as Hemidoras stenopeltis (Kner), from the mouth of the rio Negro, Brazil. Eigenmann (1925) transferred hasemani to Leptodoras and provided the first detailed de-scription of the genus. Myers & Weitzman (1956) described Hassar praelongus from the rio Negro, Brazil, and Fernández-Yépez (1968) described Anduzedoras copei from the Orinoco Basin, Venezuela. Most recently, L. myersi was described by Böhlke (1970) from specimens collected in a deep-water trawl of the río Amazonas near Iquitos, Peru.\n\nAlthough all seven nominal Leptodoras are valid species, their identification in the literature (L. juruensis excepted) is often inconsistent. Taxonomic confusion has been the product of several factors: 1) several species (L. praelongus, L. copei, L. hasemani) closely resemble one another or species in other genera (e.g., Hassar), 2) the distributions and identities of two species (acipenserinus and linnelli) have been misunderstood, 3) all seven species were described from small geographic areas (usually a single locality) with no information on their potential distributions, and 4) specimens (especially adults) have been rare in museums until very recently.\n\nIncreased sampling efforts over the past decade, particularly those utilizing bottom trawls (e.g., the Calhamazon Project led by J.G. Lundberg), have yielded large numbers of Leptodoras specimens. These recent collections and a survey of the primary types (all extant) made this study possible. Perhaps the most surprising discovery resulted from the examination of specimens routinely identified as L. acipenserinus or L. linnelli. This revealed three undescribed species distributed in the main channel of the río Orinoco, the Colombian and Venezuelan llanos (Orinoco drainage) and Amazon basin, respectively.\n\nThe objectives of this paper are to diagnose the genus Leptodoras and its nominal species and to describe three new species.\n\nInstitutional abbreviations follow Leviton et al. (1985) with the addition of UNT for Universidade do Tocantins, Porto Nacional, Brazil. Standard terminology for features of barbels and labial structures was developed to facilitate their description (Fig. 1). Measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers (<150 mm), dial calipers (150 to 180 mm) or a beam compass (>180 mm). Measurements and corresponding landmarks (Fig. 2) coincided in part with those of Böhlke (1970) and Higuchi et al. (1990). Some measurements were changed to improve repeatability (via better landmarks) or to synchronize the terminus of one with that of another. Poorly defined landmarks (e.g., those requiring physical manipulation of specimen to visualize) were marked with insect pins.\n\nPoint-to-point straight-line measurements (Fig. 2) are defined as follows with the first set reported as percentages of standard length (SL)-snout tip to point on midlateral side of caudal peduncle level with ventroposterior corner of hypural 3+4 (determined by gently flexing the caudal fin and/or backlighting); head length (HL)-snout tip to posterior-most extremity of fleshy opercular flap; predorsal distance (PdD)snout tip to posterior margin of second nuchal plate coinciding with median sagittal plane; dorsal origin-adipose distance\n\n(DOAD)-from groove between posterior margin of second nuchal plate (anterior to base of dorsal-locking spine) to posterior-most base of adipose fin; (AdCD)-posterior-most base of adipose fin to point coinciding with posterior terminus of SL; prepectoral distance (PpD)-snout tip to point between notch formed by margin of cleithrum and extreme base of pectoral spine (spine positioned at a 30-45° angle with the long axis of body); pectoral-pelvic distance (PPD)-from base of pectoral spine (terminus of PpD) to base of first (anteriormost) pelvic-fin ray (best visualized by abducting pelvic fin); pelvic-anal distance (PAD)-from base of first (anterior-most) pelvic-fin ray to base of first anal-fin ray; anal-caudal distance (AnCD)-from base of posterior-most anal-fin ray to point coinciding with posterior terminus of SL; dorsal spine length (DSL)-from groove between posterior margin of second nuchal plate and base of dorsal locking spine to bony tip of dorsal spine (spine at a 30-45° angle with the long axis of the body, soft break-away tip excluded if present); pectoral spine length (PSL)-from base of pectoral spine (terminus of PpD) to bony tip (soft break-away tip excluded if present); pelvic fin length (PFL)-from base of first (anterior-most) ray to distal-most tip of anterior fin (not the measurement of an individual ray); anal-fin base (AnFB)-distance between anterior-most and posterior-most bases of anal fin insertion; body depth (BD)greatest distance in median sagittal plane between shallow crest of posterior margin of second nuchal plate (anterior to dorsal-fin origin) and midventral contour of body; caudal peduncle depth (CPD)-least depth of caudal peduncle.\n\nThe following set is reported as percentages of predorsal distance (preferred to head length because of ease and accuracy of measurement): horizontal adipose eye diameter (AED)from anterior-most margin (often level with the weakly defined posteroventral corner of the lateral ethmoid forming anterodorsal portion of bony orbit) to posterior-most margin (usually level with bony margin of orbit coinciding specifically with the anteroventral corner of sphenotic) of adipose eyelid; snout length (SnL)-snout tip to anterior-most margin of adipose tissue covering eye (adipose eyelid often becomes opaque during preservation and its margin is usually distinguishable from pigmented skin on snout); snout-anterior nares distance (SAND)-snout tip to center of opening of anterior nares (membranous flap ignored); snout-posterior nares distance (SPND)-snout tip to center of opening of posterior nares (flap ignored); snout-posterior orbit distance (SPOD)snout tip to posterior-most bony margin of orbit coinciding specifically with anteroventral corner of sphenotic; anterior Fig. 2. Landmarks and measurements used for morphometric analysis (shown on generalized doradids). See Material and Methods for explanations of abbreviations.\n\nnares-posterior orbit distance (ANPOD)-from center of opening of anterior nares to posterior-most bony margin of orbit coinciding specifically with anteroventral corner of sphenotic; posterior nares-posterior orbit distance (PNPOD)-from center of opening of posterior nares to posterior-most bony margin of orbit coinciding specifically with anteroventral corner of sphenotic; internares distance (ID)-between centers of openings of anterior and posterior nares; postorbital length (PL)-from posterior-most bony margin of orbit coinciding specifically with the anteroventral corner of the sphenotic to posterior margin of second nuchal plate coinciding with median sagittal plane; postcleithral (humeral) process length (PcPL)-from posterior-most tip of process to point along anterodorsal margin of exposed process where the cleithral bone is deflected medially (exposed process often appears textured compared to the smooth face of medially deflected portion of the cleithrum and this deflection often coincides with or lies just beneath the posterior-most margin of the fleshy opercular flap); jaw-upper labial extension distance (JULED)-straight-line measurement along median sagittal plane from point level with anterior jaw margin to point level with posterior-most tip of shorter of paired upper labial extensions lying (or pinned) flat against ventral surface of head (performed only on specimens with well preserved labial structures not desiccated or twisted); head width (HW)-greatest transverse distance between lateral contours of head (i.e., opercula compressed to normal position if flared) anterior to cleithra; cleithral width (CW)-greatest transverse distance between lateral contours of cleithra; interorbital width (IW)shortest transverse distance between orbital (lateral) margins of bony frontals; gape width (GW)-horizontal measurement between gape corners of closed mouth (in specimens preserved with mouth open, this measurement coincided with the width of the anterior margin of the lower jaw). One measurement is reported as percentage of body depth taken in the same transverse plane (adapted from Böhlke, 1970): depth of tenth midlateral plate-vertical depth orthogonal to horizontal line formed by medial thorns of plates, from dorsal-most exposed margin of tenth plate to ventral-most margin of corresponding plate.\n\nCounts of fin rays follow Hubbs & Lagler (1958), Böhlke (1970) and Higuchi et al. (1990). Counts in dorsal, anal, and paired fins are separated into anterior spine (capital roman numeral) or unbranched soft ray (lower-case roman numeral) and posterior branched soft rays (arabic numerals). The small locking bone anterior to dorsal spine is not counted. The last (posterior-most) pectoral-fin ray may appear unbranched (particularly in juveniles). It is counted if clearly segmented with base separate from penultimate ray. In rare instances the last pectoral-fin ray may be followed by a much smaller and rather inconspicuous sliver-like element that is clearly unsegmented. This bony element is not included in the count. The anteriormost anal-fin ray may be extremely small and closely adhered to the second ray. The last anal ray may be simple or composed of two branches with bases joined or in very close proximity (counted as one in either case). Counts of midlateral plates begin with the vertically expanded infranuchal plate that dorsally contacts the posterior nuchal plate and ventrally contacts or approaches the distal tip of the postcleithral process. Though conspicuous and sometimes bearing a medial thorn, the small plate immediately anterior to the\n\ninfranuchal plate (in the tympanal region) is not included in counts of midlateral plates. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to investigate morphometric variation among Leptodoras acipenserinus, L. linnelli and the three new species. One of the three new species (L. cataniai) was further parsed into three groups: L. cataniai sensu stricto (rio Negro and Casiquiare canal), L. cf. cataniai Amazon form (Amazonas basin excluding Nanay and Negro) and L. cf. cataniai Nanay form (specimens largely from río Nanay, Peru). Leptodoras linnelli also was geographically divided into Essequibo, Orinoco and eastern Guiana Shield (northeastern Brazil) specimens. A total of 34 measurements (Tables 1 & 2) was taken on 96 juvenile and adult specimens representing a comparable range of sizes: L. acipenserinus (n=12,L. linnelli (25,Leptodoras nelsoni (11,, Leptodoras rogersae (9, SL 89.2-177.9 mm), L. cataniai sensu stricto (15, SL 97.7-171 mm), L. cf. cataniai Amazon form (10,and L. cf. cataniai Nanay form (14,. Specimens used in PCA analyses are denoted by an asterisk in material examined.\n\nPrincipal components analysis was performed on the covariance matrices of 34 log-transformed measurements. The resulting first principal axis (PC I) explained a large proportion of the total variance (88.6%) and all variable loadings were positive and varied little in magnitude. PC I was therefore interpreted as a general size factor (Jolicoeur & Mosimann, 1960;Jolicoeur, 1963;McElroy & Douglas, 1995). Scores were plotted for PC II, III and IV, interpreted to represent \"general-size-allometry-free shape\" (Bookstein, 1989).\n\nMorphometric analysis. Plots of factor scores of principal components II (PCII) vs. III (PCIII) grouped specimens into four non-overlapping clusters corresponding to: Leptodoras linnelli, L. rogersae, L. cataniai + L. cf. cataniai (Nanay and Amazon forms) and L. acipenserinus + L. nelsoni (Fig. 3a). PC II and III accounted for 4.2 and 2.2% of the total variance, respectively. Measurements loading most heavily on PC II are, in decreasing order: length of upper labial extension (-0.086), length of postcleithral process (0.052), adipose-eye diameter (-0.043), interorbital width (0.031), pelvic-fin length (-0.028) and distance from posterior nares to posterior orbit (-0.024). Standard length had a loading of 0 on PCII. Measurements loading most heavily on PCIII are, in decreasing order:\n\ntenth midlateral plate depth (-0.039), adipose eye diameter (0.035), anal-fin base (-0.03), distance from posterior nares to posterior orbit (0.029), and distance from anal fin to terminus of SL (-0.028). Plots of PCII vs. PCIV grouped specimens into three clusters along the x-axis (PCII), one distinct (L. acipenserinus + L. nelsoni) and two weakly overlapping corresponding to L. cataniai + L. cf. cataniai (Nanay and Amazon forms) and L. linnelli + L. rogersae, respectively (Fig. 3b). PCIV contributed very little to the resolution of individual species. However, PCIV (y-axis) did separate L. cataniai and L. cf. cataniai into three weakly overlapping clusters with specimens from the Amazon (L. cf. cataniai Amazon form) intermediate to those from the Negro (L. cataniai sensu stricto) and Nanay (L. cf. cataniai Nanay form). Measurements loading most heavily on PCIV are, in decreasing order: snout-anterior nares distance (-0.039), snout length (-0.029), length of upper labial extension (-0.025), adipose-eye diameter (0.024), internares distance (0.022), and body depth at 10th plate (0.021).\n\nLeptodoras Boulenger 1898:478. Type species: Oxydoras acipenserinus Günther 1868a, by subsequent designation of Eigenmann, 1910:395.\n\nLeptodoras is diagnosed from other genera of the Doradidae by unique modifications of the oral hood (upper labial extensions distinct, elongate and comparatively smooth with entire, scalloped or fimbriate lateral margins and interlabial membranes narrow or of moderate width), first gill arch (enlarged accessory lamellae on medial face of arch extend well onto medial face of gill filaments), and gas bladder (reduced size, modified cordiform shape, two distinct horn-like diverticula project from posterior walls of posterior chambers and pair of bulbous diverticula project from lateral walls of anterior chamber).\n\nIn Leptodoras the labial skin covering the jaws at the corners of the mouth continues posteriorly as a pair of long\n\nTable 2.

A thin membrane also joins the medial margin of lower labial extension to the outer jaw barbel. The lateral margin of upper labial extension is free from maxillary barbel and its origin roughly coincides with that of anteriormost 2° maxillary barbel. In all Leptodoras except L. praelongus and L. copei, the dorsalmedial surface of the lower labial extension is joined to a membranous fold (dorsolabial membrane, Fig. 1b) that originates on ventrolateral corner of snout posterior to base of maxillary barbel. Higuchi (1992:220) also considered the oral hood to be uniquely derived among Leptodoras.\n\nIn Leptodoras enlarged accessory lamellae (each appearing as a column of soft lappets) occur along the medial face of the first gill arch and extend well onto the medial face of the gill filaments (Fig. 6). In some Leptodoras (cataniai, juruensis, myersi), smaller accessory lamellae extend well onto the lateral face of the gill filaments and the gill rakers are absent or inconspicuous (Fig. 6b). Higuchi (1992:221) previously noted the morphology of the first gill arch as diagnostic of Leptodoras.\n\nIn Leptodoras the gas bladder has a modified cordiform shape and is reduced in overall size (i.e., shortened in particular; width greater than or equal to length) (Fig. 7). Furthermore, in all Leptodoras there are: two distinct and relatively large horn-like diverticula that project from the posterior wall of the gas bladder, and discrete pairs of bulbous diverticula that project from the anterolateral walls on either side. The uniqueness of gas-bladder morphology in Leptodoras was first suggested by Eigenmann (1925).\n\nComparisons. The oral hood in Leptodoras is most closely approximated among other doradids by Anduzedoras oxyrhynchus (Valenciennes) (Fig. 4a). In this monotypic genus the labial skin extends posteriorly beyond the corners of the mouth as flap-like structures united by an interlabial membrane. However, the labial extensions are relatively short and thickened, their ventral surfaces are rugose and papillate (vs. relatively smooth in Leptodoras), and the interlabial mem-brane is relatively thick with numerous papillae (vs. thin and few papillae in Leptodoras). Some authors have suggested that the labial extensions (the upper in particular) are derived from the barbels (e.g., Günther 1868b:230;Boulenger 1898:478, Eigenmann 1925:357;Böhlke 1970:57). Based on their formation in Leptodoras and related taxa these structures appear to be modifications of the labial skin as indicated by Higuchi (1992:220).\n\nThe accessory lamellae on the gill arches in Leptodoras resemble to those of certain other doradids (e.g., Doras, Anduzedoras, Hassar, Hemidoras). However, in these taxa the accessory lamellae are restricted to the medial face of the gill arch itself and do not extend onto the gill filaments.\n\nIn most other doradids the gas bladder is relatively large and often has an elongate cordiform shape. Other fimbriate-  P R O O F S barbel doradids have a single medial posterior diverticula that may be simple (e.g., Doras carinatus), split into two fingerlike projections joined at the base (e.g., Trachydoras), or ornamented with small bulbous swellings or thin finger-like projections (e.g., Anduzedoras, Hassar). Also unlike Leptodoras, the anterolateral walls of the gas bladder in other fimbriatebarbel doradids are smooth (e.g., Doras) or variously ornamented with many bulbous (e.g., Anduzedoras) or finger-like (e.g., Hassar, Hemidoras) diverticula. Rhynchodoras (genus with simple barbels) also has a reduced gas bladder and one species (R. woodsi) has two posterior horn-like diverticula. However, in R. woodsi the lateral walls of the anterior chambers are smooth (vs. with a pair of bulbous diverticula in Leptodoras). Key to the species of Leptodoras. 1.

Diagnosis. Uniquely distinguished among Leptodoras by shal-low midlateral plates covering < 1/4 body depth (vs. >1/4 in all other species), and anterior nuchal plate usually of moderate width (longer than wide) permitting weak to firm suture between supraoccipital and middle nuchal plate (vs. anterior nuchal plate laterally expanded, sharing broad suture with epioccipital or forming dorsal border of nuchal foramina). Also distinguished from all Leptodoras except L. copei by having distal tip of lower labial extension extending beyond that of upper labial extension. Fig. 8.

Many collecting sites are associated with large river cataracts. Most records are from blackwaters. However, a few are from whitewater rivers (e.g., rios Branco and Madeira), and one is from a clearwater river (rio Tocantins).\n\nType-material examined.\n\n1/3 of body depth), and pectoral-fin spine short, not reaching anterior origin of pelvic fin when depressed.\n\nComparisons. Among Leptodoras, only L. hasemani also has a laterally expanded anterior nuchal plate with no nuchal foramina and it is distinguished by having a dark black blotch in distal half of dorsal fin (vs. absent in L. copei). Leptodoras praelongus also has a long lower labial extension, but is distinguished by having a narrower anterior nuchal plate (supraoccipital usually sharing suture with middle nuchal plate vs. like suture absent in copei), shallower anterior plates (cov-ering at most 1/4 of body depth vs. 1/3 in copei), and longer pectoral-fin spine (reaching or extending beyond anterior origin of pelvic fin when depressed vs. falling short of pelvic-fin origin in copei).\n\nDescription. Somewhat torpedo-shaped; body elongate, nearly symmetrical in cross-section, predorsal region bluntly cone-shaped, caudal peduncle short, depressed. Eye large with well-developed adipose eyelid. Mouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults and juveniles as small as 31 mm SL. Maxillary barbel of moderate length, Fig. 10. Leptodoras copei, ANSP 162466 (SL 141.5 mm), río Orinoco (Atlantic dr.), near mouth of río Iguapo, Amazonas, Venezuela.\n\nfinishing short of ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 7-10 (modally 8), flattened, largely overlapping; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margins; distal ones smooth. Remaining features of buccal hood very similar to L. praelongus except lateral margin of upper labial extension entire or weakly scalloped. Branchiostegal flap and morphology of first gill arch also as in L. praelongus. Sum of midlateral plates 70-74 (modally 72, Table 3). Anterior midlateral plates of moderate depth, covering slightly more than 1/3 of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with small serrae. Tympanum usually with 3 small ossifications (plates or weak spines) along postotic laterosensory canal; small fixed spine usually visible along posterior margin of neurocranium where postotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process short to moderate in length, nearly uniform width or slightly expanded posteriorly. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield weakly defined. Nuchal foramina absent. Skin sometimes with very small fleshy papillae scattered over snout and dorsolateral flanks; papillae on snout variously cojoined to form irregular longitudinal ridges especially in juveniles (<100 mm SL).\n\nDorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,8-9 (modally 9); pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 13-16 (first 4 or 5 unbranched); caudal-fin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudalfin rays 16-19, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 15-17. Dorsal-fin spine of moderate length, slender and weakly curved for much of length with short, sharp divergent tip; anterior denticulations antrorse, very small, crowded basally, largely absent from distal half; posterior denticulations retrorse, small but regularly spaced nearly to tip. Pectoral-fin spine sturdy, short, gently bowed with sharp tip; anterior denticulations antrorse, very small, absent from distal third; posterior denticulations retrorse, gradually decreasing in size from midlength to tip; last posterior denticulation subterminal. Pelvic fin of moderate length, rounded to weakly pointed. Anal fin triangular, tip of longest branched ray more or less even with vertical through base of last ray, distal margin shallowly concave. Caudal fin forked with rounded to weakly pointed lobes.\n\nColoration in alcohol. Similar to L. praelongus except lower sides more often depigmented. Head and body weakly countershaded, upper sides relatively uniform tan or graybrown, lower and ventral surfaces white to cream. Base of dorsal spine with black anterior margin and dusky sides, remaining dorsal fin usually depigmented except for scattered melanophores on skin covering insertion. Pectoral fin with faint concentration of melanophores along base forming light streaks on distal membranes. Pelvic, anal and paired fins cream, hyaline. Caudal fin with melanophores forming black streaks on lower membranes of upper lobe and upper membranes of lower lobe, remaining fin cream. Juveniles often with two dusky blotches on base of caudal fin, one above and one below midlateral plates (blotches overlie aforementioned streaks).\n\nSpecimens from the rio Amazonas (all juveniles, hereafter referred to as Leptodoras cf. copei) exhibit a color pattern distinguishable from that typical of juvenile L. copei from the rios Negro and Orinoco. In Amazon specimens the base of the dorsal fin is rather darkly pigmented and the dorsolateral sides beneath the dorsal and adipose fins are often dusky with scattered melanophores. In dorsal view, these markings appear as a pair of opposing chevrons.\n\nLeptodoras copei sensu lato is known from the upper río Orinoco, rio Negro and río Amazonas in Venezuela, Brazil and Peru (Fig. 11). Most collections are from large river habitats in the upper río Orinoco, rio Negro and the mouths of their larger tributaries. Leptodoras copei was described on the basis of a juvenile from the río Capanaparo, tributary to the middle Orinoco. Another collection of small juveniles is from a downstream site on the Orinoco near the mouth of the río Caura.\n\nSpecimens examined from the rio Amazonas are all juveniles, but may represent (based on color pattern) an undescribed species related to L. copei. Santos et al. (1984:52) figured (as Doras cf. lipophthalmus) a specimen from the lower rio Tocantins, Brazil (not mapped in Fig. 11), that may represent an adult of the Amazon species or yet another undescribed species related to L. copei.

Maxillary barbel long, usually reaching ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 7-11 (modally 10), flattened, largely overlapping; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth.\n\nUpper labial extension rather elongate, straight to weakly curved medially, width nearly uniform, tip bluntly rounded, ventral surface smooth, distal lateral margin weakly expanded and with small fimbriae.

Anal fin triangular, tip of longest branched ray more or less even with vertical through base of last anal fin ray, distal margin nearly straight or very shallowly concave. Caudal fin forked with rounded or weakly pointed lobes.\n\nHead and body coloration similar to L. hasemani; weakly countershaded, upper sides somewhat uniform tan or light gray, occasionally darker brown (Brazilian specimens). Wide dusky middorsal stripe evident in some specimens, flanked by lighter areas along upper sides. Melanophores sometimes weakly concentrated in skin between and above dorsal wings of midlateral plates, effecting appearance of faint dusky stripe. Lower sides and ventral surfaces white to cream. Dorsal, anal and paired fins without distinct markings. Dorsal fin with faint stippling on rays and skin covering insertion; darker stippling concentrated along anterior margin of dorsal spine and around perimeter of locking spine. Pectoral and pelvic fins cream to white with faint stippling on dorsal surfaces. Anal fin cream, hyaline. Caudal fin with parallel pair of dusky stripes as in L. hasemani.\n\nLeptodoras linnelli is known from the upper río Orinoco (ríos Ventuari and Mavaca) and a tributary of the Casiquiare (río Siapa), Venezuela; Atlantic Coast drainages of the Guianas and northern Brazil (e.g., Essequibo, Demerara, Araguari); and the rios Uatumã (Amazonas dr.), Tacutu (Branco dr.) and lower Demini (Negro dr.), Brazil (Fig. 16). The distribution of L. linnelli appears to be restricted to river systems draining the Guiana Shield. Most collections are from whitewater or turbid rivers, often in places with sandy beaches and swift currents (e.g., cataracts). P R O O F S Leptodoras acipenserinus (Günther, 1868) Figs. 5d-f, 17, 18a,b and 19a Oxydoras acipenserinus Günther 1868a: 475 (type locality: Xeberos (= Jeberos) near río Aipana, small tributary joining río Huallaga near the latter's confluence with río Marañon (Amazonas dr.), Loreto, Peru. Diagnosis. Distinguished from all Leptodoras except L. linnelli by having adipose fin extended anteriorly as a low thin ridge of adipose tissue to a point midway between anterior insertion of adipose fin and posterior insertion of dorsal fin. See diagnosis of L. linnelli for characteristics distinguishing it from L. acipenserinus. Description. Morphometrics summarized in Table 1. Body very elongate and dorsoventrally depressed, ventrally flattened from snout to vent; head also depressed, short relative to body with comparatively long acute snout; dorsal profile of snout shallowly convex from tip to midway between nares; caudal peduncle long, shallow. Eye moderately sized with weakly developed adipose eyelid. Mouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults, small juveniles with few thin acicular teeth near medial symphysis of P R O O F S dentaries. Maxillary barbel long, usually reaching ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 9-12 (modally 11), flattened, overlapping proximally, separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth.\n\nOral hood comparatively short overall, not greatly expanded posteriorly. Upper labial extension elongate, somewhat Lshaped, proximal half straight and narrow, distal half moderately to strongly curved medially and distinctly expanded with wide lateral flap bearing small fimbriae, surface smooth.  3). Anterior midlateral plates deep, covering at least half of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with many small serrae. Tympanum usually with 3 distinct ossifications (simple or dual spines) along postotic laterosensory canal; small fixed spine usually conspicuous along posterior margin of neurocranium where postotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process rather robust, short and very deep, distal portion dome shaped with straight ventral margin. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield usually well-defined. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Skin often with distinct fleshy papillae on snout and upper head; papillae consolidated to form low pair of ridges on middorsal snout and additional ridges along margins of orbit and middorsal groove on nuchal shield. Dorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,9-11 (modally 10); pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 14-17 (first 4 or 5 unbranched); caudal-fin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudalfin rays 14-19, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 14-19.

Pectoral-fin spine sturdy, relatively short, anterior margin weakly curved, posterior margin straight, tip blunt; anterior denticulations antrorse, moderately sized nearly to tip; posterior denticulations becoming gradually larger and less retrorse towards tip of spine (last and/or penultimate denticulation nearly perpendicular to long axis of spine); last posterior denticulation terminal, its lateral margin continuous with tip of pectoral spine. Pelvic fin of moderate length with straight to weakly rounded distal margin. Anal fin triangular with elongate base; tip of longest branched ray falls well short of vertical through base of last branched ray when fin extended. Caudal fin deeply forked with elongate and pointed lobes.\n\nHead and body moderately countershaded, upper sides tan or gray-brown, lower sides and undersurfaces white. Wide dusky middorsal stripe usually evident, flanked by lighter areas along upper sides. Melanophores sometimes weakly concentrated in skin between and above dorsal wings of midlateral plates, forming faint dusky stripe.\n\nDorsal fin with faint stippling on rays, membranes depigmented, clear; darker stippling along anterior margin of dorsal spine and on skin surrounding dorsal-locking spine and along fin insertion. Pectoral fin with faint stippling on anterior rays and membranes, posterior rays and membranes depigmented, melanophores most concentrated on skin between posterior denticulations of pectoral spine. Pelvic fins with faint stippling on dorsal surfaces. Anal fin cream, hyaline. Elongate preadipose ridge light (depigmented) and of-ten well contrasted with dusky middorsal stripe. Caudal fin with divergent pair of broad diffuse stripes, one on lower half of upper lobe and other on upper half of lower lobe; lower stripe distally expanded along margin of ventral-most rays and membranes.\n\nLive specimens from the río Nanay, Peru, are light olive in dorsal half of head and body; basal portions of dorsal and caudal fins also with light olive tinge (Fig. 19a).\n\nLeptodoras acipenserinus is known from widely separate sites along the cis-Andean piedmont in the upper Amazon basin in Ecuador, Peru and Brazil (Fig. 16). Most specimens are from upland areas in the upper Napo, Marañon (i.e., Huallaga and Pastaza), Ucayali and upper Madeira (i.e., Guaporé and Madre de Dios) systems. A few specimens have been collected in lowland tributaries of the río Amazonas (i.e., Itaya and Nanay) near Iquitos. Leptodoras acipenserinus has not been found in or near the main channel of the río Amazonas downstream of Iquitos. Most specimens are from whitewaters, however this species inhabits moderately blackwater rivers as well (e.g., río Nanay). In the río Nanay it was collected at night with Leptodoras cf. cataniai over a large sandy beach in swift-flowing water.\n\nType-material examined.

Diagnosis. Distinguished among Leptodoras by the following combination: upper labial extension L-shaped, distal half moderately to strongly curved and distinctly expanded with wide lateral flap bearing small fimbriae, sum of midlateral plates modally 78, plates deep, covering more than 1/2 of body depth, adipose eye weakly developed, preadipose ridge lacking. Description. Morphometrics summarized in Table 1. Overall shape nearly identical to that of L. acipenserinus; body very elongate and dorsoventrally depressed, ventrally flattened from snout to vent; head depressed, short relative to body with long acute snout; dorsal profile of snout shallowly convex from tip to midway between nares; caudal peduncle long, shallow, depressed. Eye moderately sized, more or less centered between snout tip and origin of dorsal-spine, adipose eyelid weakly developed.\n\nMouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults and juveniles as small as 70 mm SL; smaller specimens not examined, but expected to have few thin acicular teeth near medial symphysis of dentaries. Maxillary barbel long, usually reaching ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 8-11 (modally 10), flattened, overlapping proximally, separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth. Oral hood comparatively short overall, not greatly expanded posteriorly, morphology similar to that of L. acipenserinus. Upper labial extension elongate, somewhat Lshaped, proximal half straight and narrow, distal half moderately to strongly curved medially and distinctly expanded with wide lateral flap bearing small fimbriae, surface smooth. Lower labial extension narrow, attenuate, finishing before upper labial extension. Interlabial membrane narrow (labial extensions convergent), comparatively thin with few small papillae. Dorsolabial membrane weakly developed, evenly attenuate posteriorly. Two pairs of jaw barbels with scattered elongate papillae; cojoined by basal membrane; outer pair slightly longer than inner pair and shorter than maxillary barbel, cojoined with lower labial extension via narrow membrane. Branchiostegal membrane with narrow fleshy margin weakly overlapping ventral gill opening; fleshy inner flap along cleithrum nearly complete. Morphology of first gill arch similar to L. linnelli.\n\nSum of midlateral plates 74-80 (modally 78, Table 3). Anterior midlateral plates moderately deep, covering about half of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with many small serrae. Tympanum\n\nusually with 3 distinct ossifications (simple or dual spines) along postotic laterosensory canal; small fixed spine usually conspicuous along posterior margin of neurocranium where postotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process short and deep, distal portion dome shaped with straight ventral margin. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield usually well defined. Skin with many small fleshy papillae on dorsal surface and sides of snout, papillae somewhat enlarged on medial portion. Dorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,9-11 (modally 10); pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 14-17 (first 4 to 6 unbranched); caudal-fin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudalfin rays 14-18, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 12-16. Dorsal-fin spine of moderate length and width, nearly straight, Fig. 20. Leptodoras nelsoni, paratype ANSP 182200 (SL 162 mm), río Apure (Orinoco dr.), Apure, Venezuela.\n\nevenly attenuate with sharp tip; anterior denticulations antrorse, moderately sized and crowded basally, absent from distal tip; posterior denticulations weakly retrorse to straight, weak, rather inconspicuous. Pelvic fins of moderate length with rounded to weakly pointed distal margin. Pectoral-fin spine, anal fin and caudal fin as described for L. acipenserinus.\n\nColoration in alcohol. Coloration of L. nelsoni is largely as described for L. acipenserinus with two exceptions: divergent pair of dusky stripes on caudal fin very distinct and nuchal foramina often dark gray with dense concentration of melanophores in overlying skin.\n\nLeptodoras nelsoni is presently known from a few east-flowing tributaries of the middle Orinoco: río Guaviare and upper Meta in Colombia and río Apure in Venezuela (Fig. 16). Its distribution likely encompasses other large left-bank tributaries of the Orinoco throughout the cis-Andean piedmont and llanos. Leptodoras nelsoni presumably occupies large river habitats similar to those noted for L. acipenserinus (e.g., whitewaters, swift currents near sandy beaches).\n\nDouglas Nelson, for his dedicated service to the ichthyological community since 1983 as Collection Manager of Fishes, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.

Secondary maxillary barbels 9-13 (modally 11), flattened, overlapping proximally, separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth. Oral hood as in L. acipenserinus and L. nelsoni except comparatively longer, distance from jaw margin to tip of upper labial extension 29.2-35.5% of predorsal distance (vs. 20.9-29% and 19.1-28% in L. acipenserinus and L. nelsoni, respectively); dorsolabial membrane moderately developed. Branchiostegal membrane with moderately expanded fleshy margin overlapping ventral gill opening; fleshy inner flap along cleithrum usually complete, nearly reaching cleithral notch. Morphology of first gill arch similar to L. linnelli.\n\nSum of midlateral plates 82-86 (modally 83 and 84, Table 3). Anterior midlateral plates of moderate depth, covering less than half of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with many small serrae. Tympanum without conspicuous ossifications or with 2 or 3 very small spines along postotic laterosensory canal; small fixed spine usually present (but inconspicuous) where\n\npostotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process short, moderately expanded posteriorly. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield usually well-defined. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Skin with very small fleshy papillae on snout; papillae scattered, not forming conspicuous ridges.\n\nDorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,10; pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 15-17 (first 4 or 5 unbranched); caudalfin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudal-fin rays 15-16, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays about 14.

Broad dusky middorsal and midlateral stripes faint. Divergent dusky stripes on caudal fin distinct as in L. nelsoni.\n\nLeptodoras rogersae is known from the río Orinoco from Isla Ratón (near mouth of río Vichada, northwestern Amazonas) to the delta, Venezuela (Fig. 16). Nearly all collections are from the main channel of the río Orinoco. One is from the río Cuchivero near its confluence with the Orinoco. Many specimens were collected via bottom trawls as deep as 14 m. This species is probably restricted to the main channel of the lower to middle Orinoco and the mouths of its largest tributaries.\n\n.

Distinguished among Leptodoras by a specific feature of upper labial extension (Figs. 4g, 5g-i): distal portion distinctly elongated, forming acute tip (sometimes appears as an enlarged terminal fimbriae). In species with similarly shaped upper labial extensions (e.g., L. acipenserinus, nelsoni, rogersae) the distal margin is rounded or with comparatively small terminal fimbriae. Description. Morphometrics summarized in Table 2. Overall shape similar in L. cataniai sensu stricto and two forms L. cf. cataniai Amazon (Figs. 18d, 23) and Nanay (Figs. 18c, 19b, 24), close to L. rogersae; body very elongate and dorsoventrally depressed, ventrally flattened from snout to vent; head depressed with acute snout; caudal peduncle long, shallow, Fig. 22. Leptodoras cataniai, holotype, ANSP 180918 (SL 171 mm), río Casiquiare (Negro dr.) from mouth of rio Pamoni to 4 km below mouth, Amazonas, Venezuela. P R O O F S depressed. Relative snout length longest in Nanay form (42.4-46.6% of predorsal distance), shortest in L. cataniai sensu stricto (35.4-40.2%), intermediate in Amazon form (37.6-41.3%).\n\nEye rather large with adipose eyelid moderately (Nanay form) to well-developed (L. cataniai sensu stricto and Amazon form). Mouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults, small juveniles less than 80 mm SL with few thin acicular teeth near distal medial symphysis of dentaries. Maxillary barbel long, usually reaching ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 9-12 (modally 10), flattened, overlapping proximally, separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth. Oral hood very well developed, expanded posteriorly (distance from jaw margin to tip of upper labial extension 33-47.8% of predorsal distance). Upper labial extension very elongate, proximal half straight and narrow, distal half curved medially and distinctly expanded with wide lateral flap bearing fimbriae, distal tip distinctly acute, often appearing as enlarged terminal fimbriae; surfaces smooth. Lower labial extension narrow, finishing before upper labial extension, tip often slightly expanded with terminal fimbriae. Interlabial membrane narrow (labial extensions convergent), comparatively thin with few small papillae. Dorsolabial membrane very well developed, laterally expanded and widely rounded posteriorly. Two pairs of jaw barbels with scattered elongate papillae; cojoined by basal P R O O F S membrane; outer pair longer than inner pair and shorter than maxillary barbel, cojoined with lower labial extension via narrow membrane. Branchiostegal membrane with well-expanded fleshy margin greatly overlapping ventral gill opening; fleshy inner flap along cleithrum complete, reaching cleithral notch. First gill arch (Fig. 6b) with gill rakers absent or inconspicu-ous, entirely contained within basal membrane (tips not apparent); accessory lamellae well developed, extending from basal membrane across lateral and medial faces of arches and filaments; lamellae numerous, on every second gill filament and broken into column of lappets with first lappet on medial face enlarged, deflected dorsomedially. Fig. 24. Leptodoras cf. cataniai Nanay form, ANSP 178438 (SL 164.2 mm), río Nanay (Amazonas dr.), near Iquitos, Loreto, Peru.\n\nSum of midlateral plates highly variable (Table 3); lowest in Nanay form (79-86, modally 82), highest in Amazon form (83-92, modally 88), intermediate in L. cataniai sensu stricto (82-87, modally 84). Anterior midlateral plates deep, usually covering at least half of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with many small serrae. Tympanum usually with 3 distinct ossifications (simple spines) along postotic laterosensory canal; small fixed spine usually conspicuous along posterior margin of neurocranium where postotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process very short and deep, distal portion expanded (especially dorsally) and dorsal and distals margin usually indistinct, covered with skin. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield well-defined. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Skin relatively smooth.\n\nDorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,9-11 (modally 10); pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 14-17 (first 4 or 5 unbranched); caudal-fin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudalfin rays 14-19, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 12-16. Dorsal-fin spine rather long, very thin, relatively straight in juveniles, becoming sinuous in large adults; anterior denticulations antrorse, rather small and crowded basally, absent from distal third; posterior denticulations weakly retrorse to straight, weak, rather inconspicuous. Pectoral-fin spine as in L. acipenserinus. Pelvic fin comparatively long and pointed. Anal fin triangular with falcate distal margin; tip of longest branched ray more or less even with vertical through base of last branched ray when fin extended. Caudal fin deeply forked with elongate and pointed lobes.\n\nOverall pattern similar to that of L. acipenserinus, nelsoni and rogersae. Head and body weakly to moderately countershaded, upper sides tan or gray-brown, lower sides and undersurfaces white. Wide dusky middorsal stripe evident in Amazon and Nanay forms, rather faint in L. cataniai sensu stricto. Melanophores weakly concentrated in skin between and above dorsal wings of midlateral plates, forming faint dusky stripe.\n\nFin coloration exhibits variation presumably influenced by environmental conditions, specifically black vs. whitewater habitats. In most specimens from the río Amazonas (whitewater) the fins are rather darkly pigmented. Dorsal fin with faint stippling on rays and along insertion; darker stippling along anterior margin of dorsal spine and on skin surrounding dorsal-locking spine. Pectoral fin dark with melanophores most concentrated on anterior rays, membranes, and skin between posterior denticulations of pectoral spine; posterior membranes with fainter stippling, posterior rays usually depigmented. Pelvic fin with dark stippling on anterior membranes forming streaks distally; rays and posterior membranes depigmented. Anal fin cream, hyaline. Divergent pair of dusky stripes on caudal fin very distinct as in L. nelsoni and L. rogersae. In specimens from the rio Negro (L. cataniai sensu stricto) and río Nanay (both blackwaters) the dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are almost completely depigmented, cream, hyaline. The dusky divergent stripes on the caudal fin are retained but faint.\n\nColoration in life. Leptodoras cf. cataniai from the río Nanay, Peru, appear white with a pinkish tint (Fig. 19b).\n\nLeptodoras cataniai sensu stricto is known from the rio Negro/Casiquiare Canal in Brazil and Venezuela (Fig. 25). Leptodoras cf. cataniai is known from in or near the main channel of the río Amazonas (Amazonas form) and large tributaries of the upper Amazonas such as the Nanay and Ucayali (Nanay form). In addition Santos et al. (1984:52) figured (as Leptodoras acipenserinus) a specimen from the lower Tocantins that is referable to L. cf. cataniai. In the lower río Nanay L. cf. cataniai is syntopic with L. acipenserinus and large schools of juveniles and adults of both species move into shallow, swift waters along large sandy beaches at night. The río Amazonas form has been collected in bottom trawls at depths ranging from 1.7 to 35 m (J.G. Lundberg, unpubl. data) and occurs syntopically with L. juruensis and L. myersi near Iquitos, Peru.\n\nEtymology. Named in honor of David Catania, for his dedicated service to the ichthyological community since 1985 as Collection Manager of Fishes, California Academy of Sciences.\n\nBoulenger, 1898 Figs. 4h and 26 Leptodoras juruensis Boulenger 1898: 478 (type locality: rio Jurua, Amazonas dr., Brazil). Diagnosis. Distinguished among Leptodoras by two unique characteristics: body extremely elongate, predorsal distance 26-28% of SL (vs. predorsal distance > 31% in all other Leptodoras), and dorsal spine thin, weakly ossified, and prolonged well beyond tip of first ray as long flexible filament. Fig. 25. Distributions of Leptodoras cataniai (solid light blue circles, star denotes type locality), L. cf. cataniai Amazon form (solid dark blue circles) and L. cf. cataniai Nanay form (open circles). P R O O F S Description. Overall shape relatively unique among doradids. Head and anterior body dorsoventrally depressed, body extremely elongate, becoming cylindrical posteriorly; predorsal distance relatively short (26-28% of SL), ventrally flattened from snout to vent, caudal peduncle long and only slightly more shallow than preceding body. Head triangular in dorsal view with acute snout. Eye rather small with weakly developed adipose eyelid.\n\nMouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults; juveniles less than 70 mm SL usually with few well-formed acicular teeth along distal margin of dentary on either side of medial symphysis.

Secondary maxillary barbels 8-11 (modally 9), flattened, overlapping proximally, well separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth. Oral hood comparatively short overall (i.e., not greatly expanded posteriorly). Upper labial extension thin, curved medially, proximal half straight and narrow, distal half greatly expanded laterally and folded dorsally, appearing confluent with lower labial extension; margin entire (fimbriae absent). Two pairs of jaw barbels with comparatively few scattered elongate papillae; cojoined by basal membrane; outer pair longer than inner pair and shorter than maxillary barbel, cojoined with lower labial extension via narrow membrane. Branchiostegal membrane with narrow fleshy margin weakly overlapping ventral gill opening; fleshy inner flap along cleithrum absent. Morphology of first gill arch similar to L. cataniai.\n\nSum of midlateral plates 89-91 (modally 90, Table 3). Anterior midlateral plates comparatively shallow, covering about 1/4 of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with small serrae. Tympanum usually without distinct ossifications along postotic laterosensory canal; however, small fixed spine usually conspicuous along posterior margin of neurocranium where postotic laterosensory canal exits supracleithrum. Postcleithral process moderately elongate, expanded posteriorly; proximal dorsal margin strongly concave (hemicircular), dorsoposterior margin moderately convex. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield well defined, continuous with middorsal furrow between orbits and anterior groove between nares. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Skin with many small fleshy papillae scattered over snout and dorsal surface of head.\n\nDorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,10; pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 16-18 (first 5 or 6 unbranched); caudalfin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudal-fin rays 16-18, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 14-17. Dorsal-fin spine weakly ossified, very thin, prolonged well beyond tip of first ray as long flexible filament; anterior denticulations antrorse, very small, inconspicuous; posterior denticulations retrorse, weak and inconspicuous, confined to base. Pectoral-fin spine sturdy, short, anterior margin weakly curved, posterior margin straight, tip blunt; anterior denticulations antrorse, mod-erately sized nearly to tip; posterior denticulations conspicuous, becoming gradually larger and less retrorse towards tip of spine (last and/or penultimate denticulation nearly perpendicular to long axis of spine); last posterior denticulation terminal, its lateral margin continuous with tip of pectoral spine. Pelvic fins comparatively long, bluntly pointed. Anal fin triangular with elongate base; tip of longest branched ray falls well short of vertical through base of last branched ray when fin extended. Caudal fin deeply forked with elongate and pointed lobes.\n\nModerately countershaded; dorsal half of snout, head, body (above medial spines of plates) medium to dark gray; undersurfaces and lower sides of head and body (including ventral portion of plates and their median spines) white. Wide dusky middorsal stripe usually evident. Anterior face of cleithrum and dorsoposterior margin of operculum often with dark stippling sometimes forming small irregular blotches. Maxillary barbels usually countershaded, gray above, white below; tip of snout often with narrow dark patch on either side above insertion of maxillary barbel.\n\nFin coloration somewhat unique among Leptodoras. Adults with variable concentrations of black pigment in dorsal, anal, caudal, and paired fins. Dorsal fin with wide black band along base, dark pigment concentrated on bases of rays and membranes, absent or faint on spine, distal portion of fin depigmented, hyaline. Pectoral fin often intensely black with narrow light distal margin; pigment most concentrated near base of fin, restricted to membranes distally, faint on spine. Pelvic fin with dusky base forming narrow black streaks on membranes, distal margin white. Anal fin sometimes with dusky band on basal half, band widens anteriorly to form dark blotch. Base of caudal fin dusky, interrupted midlaterally by narrow depigmented area. Upper caudal-fin lobe with dusky basal blotch, distal portion white, hyaline. Lower caudal-fin lobe with narrow black steaks formed by concentration of pigment on membranes, dark pigment lacking on rays and along distal margin.\n\nRemarks. The caudal-fin pigmentation in L. juruensis (i.e., lower lobe dusky) is convergent with that of a few North American cypriniform fishes peculiar to deep, swift channels of large rivers. Examples include several minnows in the genera Macrhybopsis and Platygobio (Page & Burr, 1991) and juveniles of the blue sucker, Cycleptus elongatus (Etnier & Starnes, 1993).\n\nDistribution. Leptodoras juruensis is known from the main channel of the río Amazonas from Iquitos, Peru downriver to near its mouth at the confluence of the rio Xingu, Brazil, and from the lower courses of large Amazonas tributaries (Içá, Juruá, Japurá, Purus, Madeira) (Fig. 27). This species appears restricted to the deep, rather swift channels of very large whitewater rivers. In the Brazilian Amazon J.G.  Leptodoras myersi Böhlke, 1970 Figs. 4i, 19c and 28 Leptodoras myersi Böhlke 1970: 54, figs. 1, 2 (type locality: río Amazonas, Atlantic dr., between Isla Iquitos and Isla Lapuna, near Isla Lapuna shore, vicinity of Iquitos, Loreto, Peru). Diagnosis. Distinguished among Leptodoras by three unique characteristics, the latter two noted in its original diagnosis (Böhlke 1970:54-55): body dorsoventrally depressed, greatest body depth 58-61% of cleithral width (vs. > 66% in other Leptodoras), broad dusky nuchal saddle extending ventrally across tympanum and postcleithral process, finishing on the lower side level with the pelvic-fin origin (absent in other Leptodoras), and skin on head, particularly snout, ornamented with thin elongate pale ridges (vs. round bumps or short and/ or thick ridges in other Leptodoras). Description. Head and body very dorsoventrally depressed, body moderately elongate, predorsal distance, particularly snout, relatively long, ventrally flattened from snout to vent, caudal peduncle rather long and shallow, depressed. Eye comparatively small with very little or no adipose eyelid.\n\nMouth subterminal, jaws edentulous in adults and juveniles as small as 55 mm SL. Maxillary barbel comparatively short, not reaching ventromedial extent of gill opening. Secondary maxillary barbels 7-9 (modally 8), flattened, overlapping proximally, well separated distally; proximal secondary maxillary barbels with fimbriate anterior margin and smooth posterior margin; distal ones smooth. Oral hood comparatively short overall (i.e., not greatly expanded posteriorly) and very similar to that described for L. juruensis with following exceptions: upper labial extension more expanded, broadly rounded distally, lateral margin usually with few small fimbriae, and jaw barbels more densely ornamented with elongate papillae. Branchiostegal membrane with narrow fleshy margin weakly overlapping ventral gill opening; fleshy inner flap along cleithrum absent. Morphology of first gill arch similar to L. cataniai.\n\nSum of midlateral plates 74-79 (modally 74 and 76, Table 3). Anterior midlateral plates comparatively shallow, covering about 1/4 of corresponding body depth; posterior margins of dorsal and ventral wings rounded with few small serrae. Tympanum with 2 or 3 very small ossifications along postotic laterosensory canal, posterior-most usually appearing as weak spine; small fixed spine along posterior margin supracleithrum present but usually inconspicuous.\n\nPostcleithral process moderately elongate with bluntly pointed tip; proximal dorsal margin strongly concave (hemicircular), dorsoposterior margin shallowly convex. Middorsal groove on nuchal shield well defined. Subrectangular nuchal foramina present, replacing suture between epioccipital and anterior nuchal plate. Skin with many short thin fleshy ridges scattered over snout. Dorsal-fin rays I,6; pectoral-fin rays I,9-10 (modally 10); pelvic-fin rays i,6; total anal-fin rays 14 (first 5 unbranched); caudal-fin rays i,8/9,i; dorsal procurrent caudal-fin rays 16-18, ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays 14-17. Dorsal-fin spine sturdy, short, straight, attenuate; anterior denticulations antrorse, small, inconspicuous; posterior denticulations straight, small, well separated and confined to distal half. Pectoral-fin spine sturdy, moderately elongate, anterior margin weakly curved, posterior margin nearly straight, tip blunt; anterior denticulations antrorse, moderately sized nearly to tip; posterior denticulations well developed, becoming gradually larger and less retrorse towards tip of spine (last and/or penultimate denticulation nearly perpendicular to long axis of spine); last posterior denticulation terminal, its lateral margin continuous with tip of pectoral spine. Pelvic fin comparatively long and bluntly pointed. Anal fin triangular; tip of longest branched ray more or less even with base of last branched ray when fin extended. Caudal fin forked with pointed lobes.\n\nColoration unique among Leptodoras: broad dusky saddle on nuchal shield extending ventrally across tympanum and postcleithral process, finishing on lower side level with pelvic-fin origin. Remaining head and body weakly countershaded, dorsal surfaces dusky, lower sides and undersurfaces white. Head often with dusky oblique bar along posterior margin of operculum and small dusky patch on anterior face of cleithrum.\n\nDorsal fin with few small melanophores scattered on bases of spine, rays and skin covering insertion. Pectoral fin membranes dusky with scattered melanophores, pectoral spine and rays relatively depigmented. Pelvic and anal fins depigmented, cream, hyaline. Caudal fin with faint dusky stripe on upper half of lower lobe; even fainter one occasionally on lower half of upper lobe (Böhlke 1970:59).\n\nIn some live specimens (Fig. 19c) nuchal saddle and bar are intensely black, as are pectoral fin and posterior margin of operculum; countershading more evident, gray-blue above midlateral thorns, white below; asymmetry of caudal fin pigmentation more pronounced with lower lobe darker than upper as in L. juruensis. P R O O F S Distribution. Until recently Leptodoras myersi was known only from the type series collected by trawling a swift flowing channel of the río Amazonas near Iquitos, Peru (Fig. 13). Additional specimens were recently collected in the same vicinity over large sand/silt shoals where this species is syntopic with L. cf. cataniai and L. juruensis. Type-material examined. Leptodoras myersi: holotype, ANSP 112318 (1, 73.75 mm), Peru, Loreto, río Amazonas (Atlantic Dr.), vicinity of Iquitos, between Isla Iquitos and Isla Lapuna, near Lapuna shore, 9 Oct 1955, C.C.G. Chaplin and R. Patrick, P55-9. Paratypes (12): ANSP 112319 (9, 54.7-76.7 mm), ANSP 112320 (1, c&s), USNM 203816 (2, 67.5, 74.2 mm), same data as holotype. Non-type material. Peru: Loreto: ANSP 181045 (12), río Amazonas (Atlantic dr.), near Iquitos, 4 Aug 2005. Fig. 28. Leptodoras myersi, paratype, ANSP 112319 (SL 76 mm), río Amazonas (Atlantic dr.), vicinity of Iquitos, Loreto, Peru.\n\nExamination of specimens of Leptodoras from throughout its range verified the distinctiveness of seven previously recognized species: L. acipenserinus, L. copei, L. hasemani, L. juruensis, L. linnelli, L. myersi, and L. praelongus. In addition, three new species were discovered: Leptodoras nelsoni, L. rogersae, and L. cataniai.\n\nSpecies were diagnosed in Leptodoras by one to several unique characteristics (L. praelongus, hasemani, linnelli, juruensis, myersi, cataniai), or by a unique combination of characteristics (L. copei, L. acipenserinus, L. nelsoni, L. rogersae). Similar-looking species (L. linnelli, L. acipenserinus, L. cataniai, L. nelsoni, L. rogersae) were further distinguished by morphometric characteristics. Principal components analysis (PCA) of 34 mensural characters resolved these species into four non-overlapping clusters corresponding to L. linnelli, L. rogersae, L. cataniai and L. acipenserinus + L. nelsoni (Fig. 3a). Measurements most useful for discriminating among these species included oral hood length, plate depth, adipose eye diameter, postcleithral process length, anal fin base, interorbital width, pelvic fin length, snout length and caudal peduncle length.\n\nPCA (Fig. 3b) partially resolved L. cataniai into three weakly overlapping clusters corresponding to L. catania sensu stricto (in the Negro) and two forms treated as L. cf. cataniai (one in the Amazon, the other in the Nanay). The greatest separation was between L. catania sensu stricto and the Nanay form with the Amazon form intermediate. Measurements contributing to their separation were associated largely with the snout, oral hood and adipose eye. Leptodoras catania sensu stricto included specimens from blackwater habitats in the rio Negro basin (Amazonas dr.) characterized by a relatively short snout, large adipose eye and intermediate oral hood length. The Amazon form included specimens from whitewater habitats (largely in the main channel of the rio Amazonas and its larger tributaries) with a comparatively short oral hood and intermediate snout and adipose eye. A single adult specimen from the rio Branco, a moderately whitewater tributary of the rio Negro, grouped more closely with the Amazon form than with L. catania sensu stricto. The Nanay form included specimens from the río Nanay, a moderately blackwater tributary of the upper rio Amazonas, and a site on the río Ucayali. The Nanay form was characterized by a comparatively small adipose eye and a long snout and oral hood. In addition to morphometrics the three forms were somewhat distinguishable by sums of midlateral plates (Table 3): mode 82 (range 79-86) in the Nanay form, 84 (82-87) in L. catania sensu stricto and 88 (83-92) in the Amazon form.\n\nIt is unknown whether the observed differences between the three forms of L. cataniai represent eco-phenotypic or genetic-based variation. The distributions of these three forms (and of many other doradid species and forms) are weakly to strongly correlated with the three general categories of water chemistry commonly associated with South American rivers (summarized in Goulding et al., 1996): whitewaters (muddy or sediment-rich), clearwaters (sediment-poor), and blackwaters (sediment-poor, tannin-stained, usually acidic). Rivers with headwaters in the Andes are sediment-rich whitewaters. Rivers that drain geologically older uplands to the east of the Andes (e.g., Brazilian and Guiana Shields) are often clear or nearly so. Rivers that drain predominantly lowland, sandy soils tend to be blackwaters. Some rivers are relatively easy to categorize whereas others represent intermediate conditions. Furthermore, although the main channel of the Amazon is distinctly whitewater, its tributaries range along a continuum from white (e.g., Madeira, Juruá) to black (Negro) to clearwaters (Tapajós, Xingu). Likewise, the blackwater rio Negro has moderately turbid tributaries (e.g., Branco). As a result, the Amazon basin is a complex mosaic of various water chemistries. Likewise, the geographic distributions of the three forms of L. cataniai are likely to be more complex than described herein, and may represent a parallel mosaic pattern if each form prefers certain water conditions.\n\nThe extent to which differences in water chemistry act as barriers to dispersal and gene flow among the three forms of L. cataniai is not known. Equally unknown is the extent to which morphological differences in the three forms can be attributed to local adaptations to water quality vs. historical vicariance events that may have once isolated certain populations. The observed differences between the three forms may be a product of both, perhaps initiated by vicariance and currently maintained by conditions related to water chemistry. Molecular data are needed to assess levels of gene flow between the three forms and the relative independence of their evolutionary trajectories (sensu Dowling et al., 1992). Given the absence of such data and the incomplete knowledge of their distributions it seems premature to decide whether the three forms of L. cataniai represent clinal variation or discrete taxa (i.e., species or subspecies).\n\nThe genus Leptodoras with descriptions of three new species"
