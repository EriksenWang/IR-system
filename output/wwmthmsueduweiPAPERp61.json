    "full_text": "This paper is the first of a series of papers on the study of the mathematical properties of a certain class of functions, named Distributed A pproximating Functionals (DAFs) which were originally introduced by Hoffman, Kouri and coworkers [1][2][3]. The DAFs were first utilized as approximate Dirac delta kernels, in the sense that they were used to approximate, with respect to various norms, smooth functions, their various derivatives, and certain other linear transformations [4][5][6]. Discrete sampling of the action of the kernel on appropriate smooth functions was used to derive practical approximations. Some example applications of DAFs were for the numerical solution of certain ODEs and PDEs [4][5][6]. The empirical observation of controllable accuracy achieved in many such applications motivated Chandler and Gibson to analyze the convergence properties of the HDAFs [7]. Chandler and Gibson in [7] established a rigorous mathematical basis for what Hoffman, Kouri and coworkers were referring to as \"delta sequences\". They introduced the rigorous concept of unity approximations (see definition 3). In fact, both the HDAFs created by Hoffman, Kouri and coworkers and the \"interpolating DAFs\" created by Wei, Hoffman, Kouri and coworkers [4,[8][9][10] yield unity approximations, as we prove in section 3. Moreover, in this section we generalize the class of Sinc DAFs. The practical significance of unity approximations is that functions belonging to certain \"large\" function spaces, and their derivatives, can be systematically approximated, with respect to the uniform norm, by sequences of functions produced by filtering the original function (see theorem 2). Essentially, this particular result establishes mathematically the character of DAFs as \"delta sequences\", as mentioned above.\n\nMore recently, DAFs were used with remarkable success as multiresolution scaling functions to generate wavelets for image processing applications [4,6,[8][9][10]. The successful application of these ideas in a variety of domains suggests that there is a deep relation between DAFs and multiresolution techniques, both in univariate and multivariate settings. In section 2, we show that DAFs can be used for the detection of edges (singularities of functions) based on the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), rather than the theory of multiresolution analysis (see theorem 1).\n\nThe first DAF developed, called the Hermit Distributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF), is not interpolative on the input grid points [1]. That is, the HDAF approximation to a suitable function at any grid point, x j , is not exactly equal to the input data value. In contrast to the interpolative property, the HDAF approach to functional approximation has the property that there are no \"special points\". Another type of DAF, which we call Sinc-class DAFs, and two of its specific realizations, the Sinc DAF and generalized de la Vallée Poussin DAF, are discussed in detail in section 3.\n\nWe conclude this introduction with a few remarks to orient the reader. The space L 2 (R) is the Hilbert space containing all measurable functions f defined on R with complex or real values such that +∞ -∞ f (t) 2 dt < +∞. This space possesses an inner product defined by\n\nThe CWT on L 1 (R) is defined in equation (6). Although an additional hypothesis, called the admissibility condition, must be imposed on the wavelet ψ to ensure the \"exact reconstruction\" of a wavelet-analyzed function, we will consider functions φ and ψ in L 1 (R) suitable to define accurately the mappings σ and W given in section 2, without using the admissibility condition. Thus we will avoid giving the definition of a wavelet here. The hypotheses we impose on φ and ψ in section 2 are sufficient to ensure validity of theorem 1.\n\nFor 1 p < +∞, we define the L p (R) to be the linear spaces of measurable complex valued functions f such that +∞ -∞ |f (t)| p dt < +∞. We define the norm • p as\n\nOnly for p = 2, L p (R) is a Hilbert space. For all other cases, L p (R) are Banach spaces (see [11] for more details). By • ∞ we denote the uniform norm on the space of bounded functions on R.\n\nFinally, a measurable function\n\nIt is known that if F is absolutely continuous then it is continuous and differentiable almost everywhere (i.e., there exists a measurable subset\n\nFor absolutely continuous functions, integration by parts is true. The interested reader may refer to [11] for more details on absolute continuity.\n\nHolschneider [12] has given a very interesting perspective on the Continuous Wavelet Transform. Assume that φ is in L 1 (R), bounded and uniformly continuous. Then for any arbitrary f ∈ L 1 (R), a > 0, b ∈ R we define\n\nThe integrability of f and φ implies that σ f (b, a) is well defined. In addition, the uniform continuity and the boundedness of φ imply that σ f is a continuous function.\n\nWe can interpret the function σ f as a continuous wavelet transform with respect to the window function φ. We will refer to φ as a father wavelet. We will consider the derivatives ∂σ f /∂a in (0, +∞) and try to interpret them in terms of a continuous wavelet transform with respect to another window function. Thus, the idea is that ∂σ f /∂a gives us the \"rate\" of the change of information from one scale to another.\n\nIn addition to the previous hypotheses, we assume that φ is differentiable and that tφ (t) is bounded and absolutely integrable. Then\n\nis in L 1 (R). We will refer to ψ as a mother wavelet. Next, we define\n\nTheorem 1. If φ satisfies the preceeding hypotheses, then we have that\n\n) Proof. Let a ∈ R + , b ∈ R and {h n } n be an arbitrary sequence such that lim h n = 0. Without any loss of generality we can assume |a + h n | > a/2 for every n ∈ N. Let |φ(t)| M 1 and |φ (t)| M 2 , for every t ∈ R. Then we have that\n\n(8) Let t ∈ R; then we can consider (1/a)φ((tb)/a) as a function of a. Since φ is differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem (considering a as a variable). Thus, for each h n and t we obtain ξ n,t ∈ (a, a + h n ) such that\n\nConsidering the right-hand side of the previous equation as a function of t we note the following. First, the term (a + ξ n,t ) -2 is absolutely bounded by 4/a 2 for every n because ξ n,t ∈ (a, a + h n ) and |a + h n | > a/2 for every n; second, for every n the function\n\nis absolutely bounded by M 2 . Therefore, we have that for every t and n\n\nSince f is in L 1 (R), we have that for every n the integrand in the right-hand side of equation ( 8) is dominated by the function (4/a 2 )(M 1 + M 2 )f . On the other hand,\n\nThe latter limit follows immediately from the definition of ψ and a trivial calculation of ∂φ a (t)/∂a. Now using Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence theorem [13, theorem 12.30] we obtain that\n\nThis completes the proof of theorem 1.\n\nMoreover, if ψ shares the same properties with φ, then the second-order derivative ∂ 2 σ f /∂a 2 can be obtained as follows:\n\nIn addition to the previous assumptions on φ and ψ, now assume that ψ is in\n\nTherefore, tφ(t) is absolutely continuous, and for every ρ > 0,\n\nThis property is a necessary condition for mother wavelets (essentially it is the condition that ψ has a vanishing \"DC\"-component).\n\nWe would like to conclude the discussion on theorem 1 with a comment on the properties of the father and mother wavelets. The hypothesis that both wavelets are absolutely integrable has not been used in the proof of theorem 1. We added this particular hypothesis because it is customary to define wavelet transforms so that they are absolutely or square integrable functions.\n\nLet us now see how Distributed Approximating Functionals produce pairs {φ, ψ} satisfying the previous hypotheses. Let φ ∈ C n (R). Define the differential operator G (m) by the following:\n\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , m. Now set where φ ∈ C m and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , m.\n\nIn the following, we present some examples to illustrate these ideas.\n\nExample 1 (Mexican hat wavelets based on the Gaussian function as the father wavelet). We take the following function:\n\nas our father wavelet (see figure 1), and for n = 1, equation ( 13) gives (see figure 2):\n\nThe function ψ 1 is the well-known Mexican hat wavelet [14]. For n = 2 and n = 3, we get (see figures 3 and 4, respectively)\n\nand\n\nThe result for n = 3 is an interesting \"Mexican superhat wavelet\".\n\n(see figure 5) as the father wavelet, and sets n = 1, equation ( 13) gives (see figure 6)\n\nFor n = 2, we obtain (see figure 7)\n\nTheorem 1 establishes that our continuous wavelet transform can be utilized for the calculation of the first derivative of another Continuous Wavelet Transform with respect to the scale. Every function in L 2 (R) admits a representation with respect to the CWT. This representation maps L 2 (R) isometrically onto L 2 (R 2 ) with an appropriate measure, where the first coordinate represents the time or the spatial domain and the second the scale. In the CWT the frequency domain is divided into intervals of the form [-2 p-1 , -2 p ) ∪ [2 p , 2 p+1 ) and we refer to p as the scale. More specifically, we do not directly consider frequencies but we replace them with the scale.\n\nNevertheless, there is a reciprocity between the scale and the frequency; the high frequency content is captured within higher scales and the low frequency within the lower scales. The higher scale analysis thus includes more information about the finer   details of the signal, while lower scale analysis gives the average characteristics or a \"blurred\" version of the signal. All these intuitive comments, which are well known in the wavelet community simply reflect that differentiating the CWT of a function with respect to scale gives us locally the rate of the change of the details of a signal.\n\nIn regions of rapid variation, partial derivatives of the CWT of a given signal with respect to scale take on values whose moduli are significantly greater than zero, at least for certain ranges of scale. Thus, such derivatives can assist us in identifying the regions where the signal is rapidly changing. Edges are regions where the smoothness of the luminosity function of an image changes much faster than in neighboring regions. Therefore, theorem 1 and the preceding discussion suggest that the CWT with respect to the mother wavelet ψ (as defined in theorem 1) provides us a tool to detect edges in an image.\n\nBelow we present the results of some illustrative experiments in edge detection using the DAF-based CWT. We consider two test functions (whose graphs are shown in figures 8 and 13) that were selected because they represent typical models for edges. Figures 11 and 16 respectively show the results of the CWT of these functions with respect to the father wavelet φ given by equation (14). Notice that as the scale increases, we obtain more and more accurate approximations to the original functions. For the function shown in figure 8, it is very clear that discontinuities occur at t = 200 and t = 300 in the time domain (see figure 11). The CWT of this function for coarser scales smoothes these two discontinuities. If we consider carefully the behavior of the CWT in figure 11 at t = 200 and t = 300 we see that over the scale interval a = 0.04 to 0.13          there is no significant change in the value of the CWT of the function f (see figure 8), but for scales from a equal to 0.13 up to 1.5, large changes are observed. Figure 10 shows the scalogram, i.e., the values of the CWT, of the function in figure 8 with respect to the mother wavelet ψ (corresponding to the particular father wavelet φ, with respect to which the CWT in figure 11 was calculated). Recall that the CWT of the function with the mother wavelet ψ is the first-order partial derivative, which respect to the scale, of the CWT of the function with the father wavelet. Carefully examining the values of the scalogram in figure 10 at t = 200 and t = 300 we see that at high scales, there is a rapid increase followed immediately by a rapid decrease, with values approximately zero away from the discontinuities. At lower scale values, one finds a smoothing of the discontinuity. It is clear that the rapidly changing values of the scalogram of figure 10, concentrated at t = 200 and t = 300, for higher scales indicate an extreme sensitivity of this method for the detection of edges.\n\nIn figure 13 the hat function is continuous but not C 1 . Notice that the scalogram in figure 15 identifies the points t = 200, t = 300 and t = 250 as \"edges\", where the firstorder partial derivative of the input signal does not exist. Experiments with different examples of father and mother wavelets, e.g., those associated with Hermite and Sinc DAFs, show similar behavior.\n\nThe present results are very encouraging. However, further experimentation with 2-D images is needed, along with additional in-depth analysis of the mathematics. This is part of an ongoing project dealing with the development of the mathematical theory of DAFs.\n\nIn this section, we shall discuss some rigorous mathematical properties of DAFs, especially in connection with two classes of DAFs. Definition 1. A function f : R → R is said to be in the Schwartz class if it is C ∞ and satisfies the property: for every n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n\nwhere f (n) is the nth derivative of f .\n\nThe set of all functions in the Schwartz class is denoted by S(R) and is a locally convex topological vector space.\n\nRecently, Chandler and Gibson studied some of the mathematical properties of the DAFs [7]. Among other things they introduce an interesting general definition of \"unity approximations\", to which DAFs belong, and whose essentials we review below.\n\nDefinition 2 [7]. Let M be a non-negative integer, let S M be the set of measurable functions f : R → C such that\n\nwhere w M (ξ )\n\nIt can be proved that S M is a Banach space with respect to • M , i.e., • M is a norm and with respect to this norm, Cauchy sequences of functions in S M converge in S M . For details, the reader should refer to [7].\n\nNext, we will follow the formalism of [7] but slightly modified. Let F be the Fourier transform in L 1 (R). For f ∈ L 1 (R) and ξ ∈ R we define\n\nPlancherel's theorem establishes that F defined on L 1 (R) ∩ L 2 (R) can be extended to a unitary operator defined on the whole L 2 (R) (with values in L 2 (R)). For notational convenience, we will assume that F defined by equation ( 22) is always defined on L 2 (R), but if f ∈ L 1 (R) ∩ L 2 (R), then we can and will properly use the above equation.\n\nLemma 1 [7]. The following are true: Statement (b) of the above lemma shows that it is legitimate to define the Fourier transform for every f ∈ S M . So we define F M := F(S M ) ∩ L 1 (R). By the general properties of the Fourier transform every element of F M is a uniformly continuous bounded function. Since F(S(R)) ⊆ S(R), the statement (a) of lemma 1 shows that S(R) is contained in F M . This implies the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 1 [7].\n\nRecall that if f is bounded then • ∞ := sup{|f (x)|: x ∈ R}, and that • ∞ is a norm for the space of bounded functions defined on R. Assume that M 1. The definition of F M does not provide a criterion to determine easily whether a uniformly continuous, absolutely integrable, bounded function defined on R belongs to F M or not. Suppose that f is such a function and that we want to check whether f is in\n\nBy the invertibility properties of the Fourier transform we conclude that f (ξ ) = g(-ξ ) almost everywhere 1\n\nsince f is continuous at every x ∈ R and f ∈ L 1 (R). Thus, f ∈ F M . Therefore, we conclude the following convenient characterization of the space F M , if M 1.\n\nFor the case M = 0, we have that F M = A(R), the Banach space of the Fourier transforms of the absolutely integrable functions.\n\nDefinition 3 [7]. A sequence {χ n } n∈N of unity approximations is a sequence of uniformly continuous elements of F 1 , satisfying the following properties: there exists\n\nThe sequences of unity approximations are generalizations of the delta sequences introduced in the series of papers by Hoffman, Kouri and their collaborators [1][2][3][4][5][6][8][9][10]. Finally, the main result due to Chandler and Gibson [7] is the following:\n\nTheorem 2 [7]. Let {χ n } n∈N be a sequence of unity approximations. Let M 0 and f ∈ F M . The following are true:\n\n(a) the operator C n : F M → F M defined by C n f := F( χn f ), where f ∈ F M , is a well-defined, bounded operator;\n\n(b) for every m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , M and n ∈ N,\n\nThe operators C n are called Continuous DAF operators. Notice that by the definition of F M and the general properties of the Fourier transform, if\n\nAlso it is not hard to see (but we will omit the details of the proof here) that\n\nwhere χ n := F( χn (-•)).\n\n1 Such aξ is a Lebesgue point for g (see [15]).\n\nRemark 1. Theorem 2 shows that { χn } n∈N can be considered as a sequence of low bandpass filters. If we consider {χ n } n∈N , then the latter sequences yield sequences of functions that are similar to approximate identities in the time-domain, as equation ( 25) indicates in particular. Moreover, theorem 2 shows that for F M which eventually contains all \"nice\" functions, unity approximations give uniform approximations of all functions in F M and of their derivatives up to order M. But the fact that {χ n } n∈N and in particular DAF functions can be considered as band-pass filters indicates that DAFs can be used as scaling functions for multiresolution analysis in L 2 (R) and more generally in L 2 (R n ). This particular property of DAF functions is currently under investigation.\n\nThe latter equation establishes that {χ n } n is a \"delta sequence\". We will now discuss several classes of DAF functions and prove explicitly that they yield unity approximations {φ n } ∞ n=1 of the type defined by Chandler and Gibson [7]. Therefore, for every such sequence {φ n } ∞ n=1 of DAF functions, we must establish that the following three properties are true.\n\nand it is uniformly continuous.\n\n2. φn (ξ ) ∞ C for every n ∈ N and ξ ∈ R for some positive constant C.\n\nThe uniform continuity of the classes of sequences of DAF functions which we study in sections 3.1 and 3.2 is apparent from their definition.\n\nHermite DAFs φ N (N 1) are given by the following formula:\n\nwhere the function H 2n is the even-order Hermite polynomial. The Fourier transform of the Hermite DAF is given by\n\nThen for M 1 we have that\n\nThe right-hand side of equation ( 28) is obviously finite, since the Gaussian belongs to S(R). Thus, φN ∈ S M for every M 1 and N 1.\n\nNext, we have that (see figures 18 and 19)\n\nand finally we have that (see figure 18)\n\nIt is apparent from figures 18 and 19 that when N → +∞, or σ → 0, φN,σ → 1. Therefore (as also shown in the paper of Chandler and Gibson [7]), Hermite DAFs do indeed yield unity approximations. Moreover, for every N 1, and M 1, every φ N belongs to F M . In addition, Hermite DAFs are C ∞ , because φN ∈ S M for every M ∈ Z + .\n\nThe following proposition shows that the Sinc-class of DAFs is not a small one. Throughout the rest of the paper we shall denote the Gaussian with variance σ by g σ , i.e.,  Proposition 2. Let f (x) be a function in L 2 (R) satisfying the following properties:\n\n1. The Fourier transform of f (x) is absolutely bounded.\n\n+∞ -∞ f (ξ ) dξ = √ 2π .\n\n3. The function f is band limited, i.e., there exists A > 0 such that f (ξ ) = 0 for every |ξ | > A.\n\nThen the sequence { φn } ∞ n=1 defined by φn := f * ĝσ n , n ∈ N, is a unity approximation as σ n → 0.\n\nProof. The Fourier transform of the Gaussian function g σ is given by the equation\n\nThus, the Fourier transform of the DAF φ n is given by the equation\n\nThe third property of f implies that\n\nWe will prove that φn,σ belongs to S M for every M ∈ Z + :\n\nNow split the right-hand side of the previous inequality into the following three parts:\n\nFirst, we will consider the first term in this sum. Assume that ξ < -A and |ξ -ω| A. Thus, ξ -A ω ξ + A < 0. This implies that for every ω ∈ [-A, A] we have that e\n\nfor every finite integer M. Note that since f ∈ L 2 (R), we have that f ∈ L 2 (R). Since f is band limited, by applying Cauchy-Schwartz inequality we conclude that f ∈ L 1 (R).\n\nAn argument similar to the one for the first summand in equation (36) applies for the third summand as well. Obviously, the second term of the right-hand side of equation ( 36) is finite.\n\nThis completes the proof that φn ∈ S M , for every M 1. This in turn implies that φ n is C ∞ .\n\nFrom equation (34) it becomes apparent that for every ξ ∈ R also\n\nThe latter inequality establishes that Sinc-class DAF sequence {φ n } satisfies the second property.\n\nFinally, we have that for every ξ ∈ R and n ∈ N, the functions ω → f (ω)e -(ξ -ω) 2 σ 2 n /2 are absolutely integrable and dominated by | f |. Moreover, lim n→∞ f (ω)e -(ξ -ω) 2 σ 2 n 2 = f (ω) for every ω ∈ R, because lim n→∞ σ n = 0. Thus, by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem we get that lim n→∞ φn (ξ ) = We shall consider a few examples of Sinc-class DAF sequences of functions that form unity approximations.\n\nExample 2 (2π -periodic Sinc-DAF). If we choose the f as the following:\n\nthen the Sinc-DAF is the following: Remark 3. Notice that every function of the form f g σ , where f satisfies properties 1 and 3 of proposition 2, is C ∞ , because it belongs to the space F M for every positive integer M.\n\nThus, we have obtained several interesting new DAFs in addition the previous HDAF. Each of these can be used to provide a means of constructing wavelet multiresolution analyses. We expect they will be of interest for a variety of applications in mathematical chemistry."
