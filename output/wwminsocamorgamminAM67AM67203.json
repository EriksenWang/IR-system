The activity expressions are simple formulae based on calorimetry, except for those of the pyroxene components, which are based on the \"ideal two-site\" model. A literature survey of analyzed occurrences of the above assemblages shows that they can be classified into (l) thermal aureoles, (2) transitional granulite terranes, (3) massif granulite terranes, (4) tectonically uplifted deep crustal granulites and (5) deep crustal granulite exotics in explosive igneous pipes. Characteristic pressure ranges for each class were found with the present geobarometers. Thermal aureoles in the Nain (Labrador) province and the Scottish Dalradians show l-4 kbar; massif granulite terranes show a notable cluster in the range 8.911.5 kbar, transitional granulite terranes fall at lower pressures, as well as lower temperatures, than the massif granulites, and the highest pressures are registered by the deep crustal uplifts, such as the Ronda (Spain) peridotite aureole and the Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, mafic granulites. Pressures of up to 12.5 kbar for the Doubtful Sound granulites confirms their deep-crustal character.\n\nThe consistent 8 kbar pressures of many granulite terranes could correspond to the base\n\nIn recent years several mineralogic geobarometers for metamorphic rocks have been proposed which make use of the common coexistence of garnet with less dense aluminous minerals such as cordierite, plagioclase, or aluminous pyroxenes. Simple reactions relating garnet to the less dense minerals form the basis of geobarometric equations. The reactions are of high variance in natural compositions, so that the corresponding thermodynamic equations are sliding-scale, or continuous, pressure indicators. A simple example is the reaction of Mg3Al2Si3Orz (pyrope) to Mg2Si2O6 (enstatite) and MgAl2SiO6 (MgTs), first calibrated from experimental phase equilibrium studies as a geobarometer by Wood and Banno (1973). The garnet+rthopyroxene barometer was originally intended for garnet peridotites of subcrustal origin, but has also been applied numerous times to high-grade crustal rocks (Weaver et al. 1978;Wells, 1979;Hormann et aI., 1980). This barometer has some severe limitations in the crustal application, mainly arising from inadequate experimental calibration for the crustal ranges of temperature, pressure, and mineral compositions. The association garnet-plagioclase-Alz SiOyquartz in high-grade pelitic rocks is the basis of another widely-used geobarometer. The calibration, based on experimental phase equilibrium work (Goldsmith, 1980) and measured thermodynamic properties of garnet and plagioclase (Newton and Haselton, 1981), is fairly precise, and the volume change of the reaction is large, which is a prerequisite of an accurate geobarometer. The main disadvantage is comparative rarity of pelitic compositions yielding the four-phase assemblage in some high-grade terranes. A third widely-used geobarometer is based on the reaction of Mg-cordierite to pyrope, sillimanite and quartz. The volume change of reaction is very large, and the requisite fourphase assemblage has been reported from many terranes. Experimental calibrations based on attempted direct equilibration of garnet and cordierite are in some conflict (Hensen and Green, 1971;Currie, l97l), as are semiempirical theoretical calibrations (Thompson, 1976;Perchuk et al., l98l). One problem stems from the poorly-known effect of molecular HzO in the cordierite structure (Newton and Wood, 1979). Another problem is the limited pressure range over which garnet and cordierite coexist, which is probably only 3-4 kbar in many rock compositions.\n\nQuartzo-feldspathic lithologies are the dominant components of many granulite-facies terranes. Pyroxene-bearing gneisses, or charnockites, commonly contain garnet, including the type charnockite found near Madras (Pichamuthu, 1970). Basic granulites are ubiquitous and abundant in all gneiss terranes as lenses, enclaves, and, sometimes, thick bodies of supracrustal or plutonic origin. Clinopyroxene or orthopyroxene or both are often accompanied by garnet and quartz. The mineralogy of charnockites and basic granulites suggests the possibility of geobarometers based on the reactions:\n\nCaAl2Si2Os+ Mg2Si2O6 :ll3CatAlzSi3O12 anorthite enstatite grossular in in in plagioclase orthopyroxene garnet + 2l3MgtAl2Si3O12 + SiO2 (A) pyrope quartz tn garnet CaAl2Si2O6* CaMgSi2O6 :2l3CatNzSi3O12 anorthite diopside in in plagioclase clinopyroxene grossular in garnet + 1/3Mg3Al2Si3O12 * SiOz G) pyrope qtartz tn garnet These reactions have large volume changes and are thus suitable in principal for accurate geobarometry. They are of high variance in crustal rocks, however. and therefore are less amenable to direct experimental calibrations.\n\nThe equilibrium condition for any reaction is that the Gibbs energy difference, AG, vanish at a given temperature, T, and pressure, P:\n\n-Arib asB agl .@ED, qLVB :ur-R?

He evaluated AGi from phase equilibrium data of Kushiro and Yoder (1966), which required a long temperature extrapolation of the data, obtained mostly above 1200\"C. Moreover, compositions of the phases in their reactions were not accurately determined. Activities of garnet components were taken from phase equilibrium reductions of Hensen et a/.\n\n(1975a) and plagioclase activities were based on the phase equilibrium dara of Orville (1972). Wood found maximum pressures of 11-13 kbar at plausible granulite temperatures of 700-900'C. These pressures seem rather high considering that the South Harris charnockites do not actually contain garnet. Wells (1979) deduced pressures of 9.1-11.4 kbar (mean of 10.5 kbar) for basic granulites of the Buksefiorden region, SW Greenland, from the same geobarometer and assuming a temperature of 800'C. He used more recent phase equilibrium data (Hensen, 1976) to evaluate AGo, and nearly the same activity assumptions used by Wood (1975).\n\nThe Hensen (1976) equilibrium curves also require long extrapolations to crustal conditions, and the compositions of phases along them were not welldetermined. Perkins (1979) calibrated geothermometers based on reactions (A) and (B) for rocks of a transitional amphibolite-granulite terrain in the Otter Lake, S. Quebec, region. He used experimental phase equilibrium work on plagioclase, pyroxenes, garnet and quartz of Kushiro (1969) and Kushiro and Yoder (1966) to evaluate the AGp's, and sum_ maized available measurements, both calorimetric and experimental, to define the activity-composition relations of Ca-Mg-Fe garnets. Indicated pressures of the Otter Lake rocks were zero to negative kilobars. The inconsistencies were traced to the dubious nature of the AG's derived from phase equilibrium data. Newton (1978) recalibrated the reaction (A) barometer using recent heat of solution data for AIf and entropy measurements for AS\". Activity relations were taken largely from deductions from natural parageneses of Ganguly and Kennedy (1974), together with experimental phase equilibrium measurements of Ca-Mg garnet mixing of Hensen et al. (1975b), based on the anorthite-garnet-Al2SiO5-qu artz reaction. Recomputed pressures of the South Harris terrane were 3-4 kbar lower than found by Wood (1975) at the same assumed temperatures. The mixing properties of garnets used by Newton (1978) have been superceded by recent phase equilibrium and calorimetric measurements.\n\nwhere AIf and ASo denote, respectively, the standard enthalpy and entropy changes ofthe reactions, Af the partial molal volume differences, a the activities at one bar, and R is the gas constant. The approximation sign is used because of neglect of differences in compressibilities. The subscripts Mg, Ca, En, Di and An denote, respectively, the components MgAl273SiOa, CaAl273SiOa, Mg2Si2O6, CaMg-Si2O6, and CaAl2Si2Os, and the superscripts Gt, Opx, Cpx, and Pl denote, respectively, the phases garnet, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and plagioclase.\n\nEquations (2) define P in terms of ? and the compositions of the phases provided that the activities and partial molar volumes are known as functions of composition and Z and that the standard Gibbs energy changes, which are the left-hand sides of equations (2), are known as functions of ?. The activities may be determined by calorimetric measurements on solid solutions and by modelling of phase equilibrium data. The partial molar volumes are determined by X-ray diffraction data for the solid solutions. The standard Gibbs energies for reactions (A) and (B) may not be deduced directly and accurately from phase equilibrium data because the reactions are not univariant and because relevant experimental phase equilibrium data (Kushiro and Yoder, 1966;Hensen, 1976) do not define closely enough the compositions of coexisting garnets and pyroxenes. However, enthalpy of solution and heat capacity measurements on the end-member substances allow purely thermodynamic determination of AGi and AGfi.\n\nPrevious calibrations Wood (1975) first used reaction (A) in geobarometric calculations of the South Harris (Scotland)\n\nIn this paper we calibrate the two garnet-pyroxene-plagioclase'4uartz geobarometers based on reactions (A) and (B) using recently determined thermodynamic data and discuss the uncertainties in pressure indication. Various parageneses of the four-phase assemblages in charnockites and basic granulites are tabulated from the literature, and apparent pressures of crystallization are calculated. The survey, although not exhaustive, shows patterns which suggest new interpretations about various kinds of granulites, as discussed in subsequent sections.\n\nTable I lists enthalpy of formation data at970K determined by oxide melt calorimetry for the phases anorthite (Newton et al, 1980), diopside and grossular (Charlu et al., 1978) and enstatite and pyrope (Charlu et al., 1975). The data of Table 1 lead to the following enthalpies of reaction at970K, taken as the differences in the enthalpies of formation of the reacting phases: AIli : 2237-1570 cal\n\n(3) AHb : 373+650 cal The error limits are taken as the square roots of the sums of the squares of the uncertainties in the enthalpies of formation in reactions (A) and (B) and are certainly overestimates, in that the uncertainties in the actual enthalpy of solution measurements have entered twice (Anderson, 1977) in the error assessment. High temperature heat capacity data (Holland, 1981) are given in Table I to correct AIf from 970 K to any temperature in the crustal range. The corrections for 900 K < T < 1150 K are very small and may be neglected.\n\nTable 1 lists entropy data at 1000 K for the six substances of reactions (A) and (B). The most important recent data are those of Haselton (1979) for pyrope and grossular which include both highaccuracy, low-temperature adiabatic heat capacity measurements and heat content measurements on the same samples at high temperatures. Krupka et al. (1979a) measured the low-temperature heat capacity of synthetic Mg2Si2O6 enstatite and heat capacities to 1000 K by differential scanning calorimetry @SC). Haselton (1979) made drop calorimetry measurements on synthetic enstatite at 973,ll73 and 1273 K and fitted a high-temperature heat capacity equation to his and Krupka et al.'s (1979a) data. Robie et al. (1978) made precise lowtemperature heat capacity measurements on synthetic anorthite, and Krupka et al. (1979b) added DSC measurements to supplement earlier drop calorimetry. According to Haselton (1979) and Perkins et al. (1980), a configurational entropy ofabout 1.0 caVK due to partial Al,Si disordering of anorthite is consistent with phase equilibrium data of anorthite and other minerals with well-measured parameters. X-ray diffraction data also require a small amount of tetrahedral disorder (Smith, 1974). For these reasons, a configurational entropy of 1.0 caVK is added to the Third Law entropy of anorthite in Table l. The uncertainty of this term, probably no more than +0.5 caVK, is one of the largest sources of uncer-\n\nTable l.

Unfortunately, this cannot be done for the partial molar volume of pyrope, because the molar volumes of F+Mg garnets have not been carefully measured yet. Therefore, the AV terms in equations ( 2) have been approximated by AIu\", the 298 K, one bar volume change. These are -23.73 cm3 for reaction (A) and -23.12 cm3 for reaction (B). Trial replacement of Vq. for Vq. in a few calculated pressures shows that the substitution results in very small pressure changes. Thermal expansion effects on the AV's are negligible.\n\nThe activity coefficient, 7, which is multiplied by the mole fraction of a garnet component to give the activity, can be expressed over a limited range of composition by the formula:\n\nwhere X is the mole fraction of the component in a binary solution and W is a constant. Most solid solutions whose properties have been measured do not obey this \"symmetrical solution\" formulation over the complete range of compositions. The fact that pyrope and grossular components of typical granulite garnets are usually restricted to the range 0.05 < X < 0.40 allows the application of (5). Enthalpy of solution measurements on several synthetic gaxnets of the pyrope-grossular series (Newton et al., 1977), together with heat capacity measurements on synthetic pyrope, grossular, and Py.oGr.+ (Haselton and Westrum, 1980), define the one bar activities in the join by (5) and:\n\nWcilnre: 3300 -1.5f(K), calories/mole (6) which applies to all except very Ca-rich compositions (Newton and Haselton, 1981). The coefficient of the temperature term is the excess entropy parameter, lVs, the existence of which was predicted by the high temperature, high pressure phase equilibrium data of Hensen et al. (1975b). Haselton and Newton (1980) showed that expression (6), based on calorimetry, is in good agreement with the Hensen et al. (1975b) data when the peculiar shape of the grossular-pyrope molar volume curve, and its effect on activities at high pressures, are taken into account. Cressey et al. (1978) derived the Gibbs energies of mixing of synthetic Ca-Fe garnets from phase equilibrium measurements based on the anorthite breakdown reaction in the system FeO-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2. The mixing energy is temperaturedependent and depends on composition in a complex way. However, the excess Gibbs energy of mixing is very small for Xcu -0.30, at least at temperatures down to 900oC, and, within the accuracy of their measurements, may be taken as zero. Deductions based on the compositions of coexisting natural phases yield Wgur.. values of -1000 to 1000 caVmole for small grossular contents (Ganguly and Kennedy, 1974;Ghent, 1976). The value of zero is taken here as the simplest assumption compatible with the experimental evidence, for the compositions of most of the garnets considered here.\n\nThe value of V/p\"y, is still subject to debate. Earlier deductions from natural parageneses resulted in a value of 2900 caVmole (Ganguly and Kennedy, 1974) but later workers using the same method have found much smaller values (Kawasaki and Matsui, 1977;Dahl, 1980). The latter reference gives the value of 1390-11160 caVmole. O'Neill and Wood (1979) determined that Fe,Mg mixing in garnet is more ideal at 1000'C and above by several hundred caVmole than is olivine at the same conditions from their experimental Fe,Mg distribution isotherms at high pressures. Wood and Kleppa (1981) found, by enthalpy of solution measurements on synthetic olivines, a non-ideality which would correspond to a W of about 1200 callmole in the Ferich range. This implies aWpey.eof garnet of about 600 callmole. Sack (1980) concluded, after a considerable review of available experimental work, that W for olivine is probably less than about 800 cal/ mole, which suggests that Wp\"y* for garnet is negligible. A value of zero is taken in this work, which is probably a lower limit of values compatible with currently-available evidence.\n\nThere is little experimental work available to determine the mixing properties of spessartine with other garnet components. Hsii (1980) experimentally found a stable join spessartine-grossular down to at least 400\"C at 2 kbar, and spessartine-grossular garnets are characteristic of low-temperature blueschist terranes (e.g. Hashimoto, 1968), which suggests a very small Ca-Mn interaction energy. The mixing of Mn with Fe2+ and, especially, with Mg may be substantially non-ideal, however. This uncertainty rules out use of Mn-rich garnets with the geobarometers considered here. This is unfortunate, since some high grade terranes have abundant manganiferous quartzites with barometrically diagnostic assemblages (e.9. Janardhan and Srikantappa, 1975). In the present study we exclude any assemblages from consideration where the garnets have Mn > Mgl3, which insures that Ca interactions with Mg and Fe far outnumber interactions with Mn.\n\nThe activity coefficient of grossular in ternary garnets may be approximated by the following expression, due to Prigogine and DeFay (1954) and used by Ganguly and Kennedy (1974): RTlnygu = Wg^y\",*y. 4 W cuufiue + (lVc'r'.-Wr.rvrg*Vll6\"1ar)Xr$ue Q)\n\nA corresponding expression exists for the pyrope component. The activity coefficients of grossular and pyrope are, with the parameters adopted above:\n\nRTlnygu : (3300-1.51)1Xlo*+X-;Xr.'1 (g) RTlnla, : (3300l.5Tl(Pc^+XcJy.)\n\nEnthalpy of solution measurements at 1000 K on many synthetic high-structural state plagioclases, together with the theoretical entropy of mixing given by the \"Al-avoidance?' model of Kerrick and Darken (1975),lead to the following expressions for the activity coefficient of anorthite (Newton et a/., 1980):  9) and ( 10). It is likely, however, that Al'avoidance (i.e., avoidance of adjacent Al-filled tetrahedra in the framework structure) gives an adequate aqcount ofthe solid solution energetics at least above 700\"C and for X^n = 0.25.\n\nFerrous iron is the main substituent in enstatite and diopside. There are currently no thermochemical data for these solid solutions; however, a number ofauthors (e.9. Saxena,1973;Sack, 1980) have concluded that FezSizO6 and Mg2Si20.6are virtually ideal orthopyroxene substituents'at temperatures above 700oC, and Bishop (1980) and Oka and Matsumoto (1974) concluded that CaMgSi2O6 and CaFe-Si2O6 solid solution is attended by a W of, at most, 2.5 kcal. Wood and Banno (1973) and Wood (1979.) have shown, by phase equilibrium deductions, that the aluminous pyroxene molecules MgAl2SiO6 and CaAlzSiOo, in enstatite and diopside respectively, are virtually ideal substituents, and Ganguly Q973) found, also from phase equilibrium work, that NaAl SizOo 6adeite) forms a nearly ideal solid solution with diopside. These considerations lead to, and justify, the \"ideal two-site\" pyroxene mixing model (Wood and Banno, 1973;Wells, 1977) expressed as: an : xM? 'xMl in orthoPYroxene\n\n(1 1) aoi: XW'xS! in clinoPYroxene where M2 denotes the larger structural site containing divalent and monovalent cations and Ml the smaller site. These formulations are only approximations; intercationic substitutions are generally attended by some non-ideality (excess Gibbs energy of solid solution). However, it is fortunate that the mole fractions of enstatite and diopside in orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, respectively, are usually high, so that effects of non-ideal mixing are minimized. The largest departure from the system CaGMgO-Al2O3-SiO2 in granulite pyroxenes is for opx-garnet-plagioclase-quartz and P : 675 + 17.r7gT + 3.5962Ttn@Ej'z(@ ---aR''' a$i. Fe2Si2O6 substitution in orthopyroxene, which has been shown to be nearly ideal. Thus, the ideal twosite model should give good results in many applications. The cation-site assignments for clinopyroxene followed here are: Ca, Na, Mn and Fe2+ in M2 and Mg, Fe3+, Ti, Al and the remaining Fe2* in Ml. Mg and Fe2* are equipartitioned between Ml and M2 in orthopyroxene (Wood and Banno, 1973).\n\nThe numerical geobarometric expressions based on equations 2) and with the foregoing input data andTinKare:\n\nThe requirements for a valid pressure calculation are textural evidence of four-phase equilibrium, reliable analyses of the minerals, and an independent temperature estimate. The first criterion may consist of contact or close local association of unzoned minerals, or compositional \"plateaus\" in cores of coarse mineral grains. Many granulites show evidence of polymetamorphism in the form of corona assemblages around garnet rims, containing pyroxenes and plagioclases of sharply different compositions from those of the broad plateaus, and the garnets may be strongly zoned with rim compositions approximating local equilibrium with the corona assemblages, or, there may be a discrete second generation of garnet. In such cases two distinct pressure indications, one for the primary or core compositions and one for the corona and rim compositions may be obtained, which may afford an interpretation about uplift from deepseated conditions or later regional retrogression. The common pattern is more calcic plagioclase, less aluminous pyroxene (frequently orthopyroxene rather than clinopyroxene) and less pyropic garnet rims in the corona assemblage than in the primary assemblage. Wet chemical analyses of garnets may fail to distinguish garnet and plagioclase cores and rims that microprobe analyses can resolve. It is very important in the temperature estimates to distinguish primary from secondary assemblages. For instance, retrograde biotite replacing garnet may not yield a valid temperature estimate with garnet cores. It is frequently hard to decide if biotite and hornblende are primary or retrogressive.\n\nThe literature of petrology abounds in descriptions of the assemblage pyroxene-garnet-plagioclase-quartz. A disappointingly small fraction of the reports satisfy the above criteria, however. Electron microprobe analyses have become abundant since about 1965, but some authors have presented only representative analyses of minerals from different rocks. Frequently, plagioclase analyses are not presented, and plagioclase is characterized only as \"oligoclase,\" for instance, or a broad range of An contents may be given. In the older literature, some minerals from a rock mav have (12) for cpx-garnet-plagioclase-quartz.\n\nThe activities at a temperature are evaluated from compositions of the phases as outlined in the preceeding section. Although the choice of temperature depends on mineralogic geothermometry, with its inherent uncertainties, it turns out that the barometric indicators are quite insensitive to temperature uncertainties: a temperature error of +100\"C introduces pressure errors of only a few to several hundred bars. The major pressure uncertainty lies in AG' of the reactions. The combined uncertainties in thermochemistry lead to uncertainties of +1500 bars for reaction (A) and -r1700 bars for reaction (B) in evaluating the errors in AG\" as the square roots of the sums of the squares of the individual uncertainties in the A/f and ?A^S'terms at 1000 K. Uncertainties in the volume terms introduce much smaller errors. The combined uncertainties resulting from errors in the activity expressions are difficult to assess. However, calculation of pressures from many different terranes, to be presented, affords considerable insight into the accuracy problem, particularly where comparison of the two barometers in the same terrane or, in many cases, the same rock, is possible. been analyzed by wet chemistry, while compositions for the others may only have been estimated from optical properties. In some descriptions, it is not clear whether qtartz is part of the equilibrium assemblage. Table 2 lists the suitable described parageneses which were found after a considerable search. Some well-described parageneses have undoubtedly been overlooked. The occurrences fall naturally into a few categories: low-pressure thermal aureoles (pyroxene hornfels facies), transitional granulite terranes, regional granulite terranes, granulite exposures of very deep-seated origin in modern uplift areas, and deep-crustal granulite exotics from explosive volcanic pipes. The temperature estimates for each locality are generally those preferred by the authors of the mineral analyses, except where noted in the following discussions. Temperatures are based on quantitative mineralogic geothermometry.\n\nTable 2 gives the calculated pressures of the assemblages using the given compositional data and the temperature estimates. It is seen that the calculated pressures span almost the entire crustal range of pressure, from about 2 kbar for andalusitesillimanite bearing migmatite terranes of the Scottish Dalradians, to about 12.5 kbar for the deepest crustal samples, the mafic granulites from Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. The clinopyroxene barometer, based on reaction (B), consistently yields pressures which average two kbar lower than those from the orthopyroxene, or reaction (A), barometer. Although this discrepancy is within the combined uncertainties in the AGP values of reactions (A) and (B), other possible interpretations will be discussed. The average spread of the calculations for a given terrane is about 1850 bars for each barometer. Details of the results for a large number ofindividual terranes, given in subsequent sections, afford insight into the problems of the precision, accuracy, and validity ofthe pressure calculations.\n\nResults for the granulite aureole of the Nain, Labrador, anorthosite complex are given in Table 2. Calculations for two orthopyroxene-bearing granulites are complicated somewhat by zoned garnets and variable plagioclase compositions, probably resulting from reequilibration during uplift of the anorthosite mass. The garnet cores and most sodic plagioclases in each rock yield an average of 3700 bars, which is considerably lower than Berg's (1977) assessment based on the garnet--cordieritehypersthene-quartz barometer (Hensen and Green, 1973\\ and earlier calibrations of the orthoferrosilitefayalite-quartz barometer (Smith, 1972), but is in good agreement with the value of 3.2 kbar calculated for the Nain aureole by Bohlen and Boettcher (1981) based on their accurate experimental work on the compositions of coexisting orthopyroxene and olivine in the presence of quartz. A combination of the most calcic plagioclase and garnet rim in one rock (NAR-2893 R) yields only 1100 bars, which may represent a late, very shallow reequilibration.\n\nThe garnet<rthopyroxene assemblage is developed in the Huntley-Portsoy area of the Buchan zone of the Dalradians, and inthe Lochnagar area of the Central Dalradians, Scottish Highlands (Ashworth and Chinner, 1978), as aluminous-basic restites of anatectic migmatites developed in the aureoles of the Newer Intrusives. Both occurrences are in metamorphic terranes containing andalusite as the regional Al2SiO5 polymorph, and both have sillimanite in the thermal aureole. If, as seems probable, the aureoles reflect nearly isobaric heating, the pressures should be at least as low as the Al2SiO5 triple-point. The calculated average pressures of 3880 bars for the Huntley-Portsoy area and 2700 bars for the Lochnagar aureole satisfy this condition for the Holdaway (1971) triple-point within the experimental uncertainty. Pressures calculated for the aureole localities using the Thompson (197 6) garnet-cordierite-sillimanite-quartz barometer are about two kbar higher.\n\nPublished mineral analyses suitable for geobarometric calculations using reactions (A) and (B) were found for twenty Precambrian localities in the present survey. Of these, ten were from large granulite tracts. most of which show the definitive features of uniformly high grade mineralogy and pronounced depletion of large-ion lithophile elements (Newton and Hansen, 1981).\n\nSix suitable metabasites and charnockites from the Adirondack Highlands, northern New York, contain both pyroxenes in addition to plagioclase, garnet and quartz. Garnet and clinopyroxene analyses are from Bohlen and Essene (1980), orthopyroxene analyses from Bohlen and Essene (1979), and plagioclases and confirmation of quartz were provided by S. R. Bohlen (written communication).\n\n6 o ts NO FO oo FF O@F FrOF clr66 @ts@ @ o s o oi o N 60 oo OF oc ON 6e @@ ts F o o N o N@€ oF <i oOF tsFO otso otso NNO 6FCO o @ CO (o @ € F o @ o co @ @ @ GO GO q ! z xr 3E z=./, >qd \\o< fuE =E -c <t @ @ o @o oco tso @ N Fc) € F O N o GO 6 @<i ts6 6CO €oo ONF tsoo ooo (oco FCO F6 o6 oo €N o@ ts GO o 6 @ @ <t @ g o F @ oo 6N ON <t <t o € oo FOO oo€ N+O OOtr 6 € @ e 6 N GO @ G o F @ o F 6 ts ts @ @ OU UE <ts E<c HEO FU n4 q= U F o 6 F oo o6 @F oo oo @ F o F ts eo 6N tsN ooo o60 Ftsts o N F o @ oo €co N@ oo Nb @@ o 6 o o @ o GO o ts ts oo oo co@ ooo ooo o@co ooo ooo @oo o N GO 6 ts co o ts CO o o F o o F G r 6 = = e o o GO t ar om o6 o6 ON tl Y 6 O oco O N @ o J I F-w= I oc oNo <FZ AY' N o I 6 I = F F< r€ P= (.t NT to ol o G 6 N N o o N o N ON IN 66 =o ol dT-@9-NNO ll aj \":-ONts coNqt ttl rUC) =-I F € C'l 6 co o @ o o @ N o o ts N o F a L o U a E = o F F o o L o co F qi EF Cv tL so 9g tc O+ ts to o g o uo6 @ts E06 C-P s c, o o € N o OF c s!

(1980). Calculated pressures with the orthopyroxene barometer average 9.2 kbar, and, with the clinopyroxene barometer, 7.0 kbar. Some of the scatter in the calculated pressures may be due to real variations over the Adirondack terrane. The orthopyroxene mean pressure is somewhat higher than the assessment of 8.0 {-1.0 kbar for the Adirondack Highlands of Bohlen er a/. (1980) based mainly on a few occurences of orthoferrosilitefayalite-quartz associated with the Adirondack anorthosite.\n\nThe average discrepancy between the orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene pressure indications in the same rock for the 6 Adirondack Highlands rocks is 2.3 kbar, close to the average discrepancy of 2.2 kbar for all rocks in Table 2 with both pyroxenes. This figure may be used in an empirical readjustment of the geobarometers, to be discussed below.\n\nThe South Indian Highlands granulite massif areas yield pressures of 7-10 kbar. These localities represent the culmination of progressive metamorphism across 200 km in southern Karnataka (Pichamuthu, 1965). Of particular interest are the Sittampundi garnet granulites (Subramaniam, 1956), which show a primary association (92P) with clinopyroxene and a secondary, or corona assemblage (92S) with a distinctly different plagioclase and clinopyroxene. The primary assemblage crystallized at 8.0 kbar, according to the barometer of reaction (B) and the retrogressive assemblage at3.4 kbar. The secondary assemblage represents a distinct and probably much younger regional metamorphism in the contact zone of the Tiruchengodo granite (Naidu, 1963).\n\nThe Archaean high-grade terranes of the Labwor Hills, Uganda (Nixon et al. 1974) and, Enderby Land, Antarctica (Grew, 1980) are higher temperature terranes than many granulite areas, as evidenced by regional development of sapphirineqtartz, and in the latter area, osumilite. The very high temperatures account for the presence of cordierite even at the elevated pressures. Garnet metabasites from Enderby Land were not described by Grew (1980). Newton and Haselton (1981) calculat= ed a pressure of 7.0-t-0.3 kbar for Grew's rocks based on the garnet-plagioclase-sillimanite-quartz assemblage. . The Furua, Tanzania, Complex (Coolen, 1980)  grade massifs where kyanite is the regional Al2SiO5 polymorph, rather than the more usual sillimanite. The calculated pressures, at the estimated temperatures of -800'C in both regions, are compatible with the experimental Al2SiO5 diagram (Holdaway,l97l), as shown in Figure 1. The Qianxi Complex, dated at 3675 m.y., is the oldest very high grade area known, and the 10+ kbar pressure shows that the early Archaean crust was, locally.at least, very thick. The early Archaean Akilia metabasites (Griffin et al., 1980) yield the same information (Table 2).\n\nThe Scourie Complex, northwestern Scotland, is one of the most intensely-studied Archaean terranes. Only recently, however, have mineral analyses been forthcoming sufficient to characterize the temperatures and pressures of metamorphism (Rol-\n\ns <l) = a o o linson , 1980; 1981a). The pressures of7-8.5 kbar for Rollinson's (1981a) basic granulites yielded by the present pressure method are somewhat less than the 10.5 kbar calculated by him by the aluminous enstatite-garnet method (Wood, 1974), and much less than the 1513 kbar estimated by O' Hara and Yarwood (1978) based on experimental phase relations of garnetiferous gabbros. The latter estimate contradicts the presence of sillimanite and absence of kyanite throughout the Scourie terrane.\n\nPressures calculated for those regions, all Precambrian, where amphibolite facies gneiss terranes give way to granulite facies, are given in Table 2. The Madras type charnockite locality is classified as transitional on the basis of variable minor element depletion and migmatitic-metasomatic aspect (Weaver, 1980). Several of the published mineralogical descriptions of the transition localities have been supplemented by personal communications to the authors.\n\nPressures, as well as temperatures, are generally lower in the transitional regions than in the massif areas. Of course, the compilation does not take into account transitional areas where the pressures of crystallization were too low to produce garnet in ordinary basic and intermediate compositions, and the pressures in Table 2 should be considered only as the higher pressure range of transitional granulites.\n\nAll of the transitional granulite terranes in Table 2 lie in well-defined gradational zones adjacent to amphibolite-grade tracts except for the Ruby Range, Montana, granulites (Dahl, 1980), which are isolated cordilleran \"core complex\" exposures. For this reason they could conceivably be classified with the isolated granulite exposures in strong uplift areas described in the next subsection.\n\nSeveral high pressure granulite terranes are exposed in areas of strong modern uplift, typically at continental margins. These include the Precambrian Basal Gneisses of southwestern Norway (Kristiansund area) (Krogh, 1980), the Doubtful Sound mafic granulites of the southwestern New Zealand Fiordland (Oliver , 1977), the mafic granulites of the Inner Aureole, Ronda Complex, southern Spain, thd Cone Peak granulites of the Big Sur area, central California (Compton, 1960), and, perhaps, the Ivrea Zone grarulites, northern Italy (Mehnert, 1975).\n\nThe latter are part of an isolated exposure of progressive amphibolite-to-granulite progression (Schmid and Wood, 1976), and perhaps should be classified in the preceeding section.\n\nThe Doubtful Sound granulites give very high pressures of9-12.4 kbar. The granulites are garnet, two-pyroxene rocks in vein complexes in mafic garnet-clinopyroxene amphibolites. Sulfate-carbonate scapolite is well developed in the Fiordland area (Blattner, 1976). In the mafic character and presence of scapolite these granulites greatly resemble the lower-crustal granulite exotics of explosive volcanic pipes in southeastern Australia (lrving, 1974) and southern Africa (Rogers and Nixon, 1975). Gravity surveys over the Fiordland show that the uppermost mantle lies only a few kilometers below the granulite exposures (Oliver, 1980). It seems quite probable from these lines of evidence that an actual section of lowermost continental crust is exposed in the New Zealand Fiordland.\n\nThe Ronda Complex is believed to be a mass of upper mantle peridotite which has been, for some reason, lifted to crustal levels during the Mid-Tertiary orogeny of the Betic Cordillera (Obata, 1980). The inner thermal aureole contains mafic granulites with a primary garnet-clinopyroxeneplagioclase-quartz assemblage and a corona assemblage with different plagioclase, clinopyroxene and garnet (Loomis, 1977). These granulites are believed to have been dragged up from the deeper crust by the peridotite mass (Loomis, 1972). The clinopyroxene barometer gives 11.1 kbar for the primary assemblage and 6.5 kbar for the corona assemblage, at the temperature of about 800'C for both assemblages suggested by Loomis (1977). These estimates correspond closely to the temperatures and pressures deduced by Obata (1980) for two equilibration stages of the peridotite mineralogy, presumably during a prolonged sojourn of the rising mass_at two discrete levels.\n\nEclogite and garnetiferous peridotite masses exposed in the Norwegian fiord country have long been considered to be of subcrustal origin, incorporated into the crust tectonically (e.9., O'Hara and Mercy, 1963). Recent reappraisal (Krogh, 1977;Carswell and Gibb, 1980) concludes that the high pressure mafic and ultramafic rocks were metamorphosed along with their enveloping crustal gneisses at pressures estimated by Krogh (1980) at 18r-3 kbar during a mid-Proterozoic very high pressure event, perhaps continental collision. Garnet-clinopyroxene assemblages in acid gneisses analyzed by Krogh (1980) give pressures as high as 13 kbarfrom the reaction (B) barometer. If, as is likely, currently-used geobarometers for peridotites and eclogites somewhat overestimate pressures, and if the reaction (B) barometer somewhat underestimates pressures, as will be discussed in the next section, it may well be that the eclogite pressure indication and that of the enclosing gneisses converge, supporting the view that they were metamorphosed together, rather than mechanically juxtaposed during post-metamorphic times.\n\nThe Cone Peak, California granulites are a veincomplex in amphibolites in a coastal terrane of precipitous relief. The Cretaceous radiometric age of a nearby charnockite body (Mattinson, 1978) supports the belief (Aitken, 1979) that the granulites are the uplifted root zones of the Mesozoic Salinia block batholiths. The pressure of8.7 kbar deduced here (reaction (A) barometer) is in contrast with the high level of emplacement of most of the California mesozoic batholiths.\n\nGranulites of the lvrea Zone are considered by some (e.g. Mehnert, 1975) to represent uplifted lowermost crust, and a large positive gravity anomaly across the zone supports this conjecture. However, the pressures calculated from the assemblage garnet-plagioclase-sillimanite-quartz by Newton and Haselton (1981) are only 6.0-+-0.5 kbar for the highest grade rocks, and this makes it seem doubtful that the Ivrea Zone is as representative of the lower continental crust as the Doubtful Sound granulites. Although the garnet-pyroxene-plagioclasequartz assemblage exists in lvreaZone mafic granulites, analyses satisfactory for geobarometry are not yet available.\n\nVarious granulites from explosive alkali basalt and kimberlite pipes have been reported recently. A large number of granulite fragments of undoubted crustal origin from the Lesotho kimberlites were analyzed by Griffin et al. (1979). Complete data exist for one specimen (LT-2) from the Letseng-la-Terae pipe, which yielded an orthopyroxene pressure of 10.1 kbar at the estimated temperature of 680\"C. This specimen is of particular value in providing the only example we have of a quenched two-pyroxene granulite with which to investigate the possibility of clinopyroxene reequilibration during slow uplift of granulite terranes, as discussed below.\n\nThe minette pipe, The Thumb, and many similar tertiary occurrences in the Four Corners area, western United States, contain suites of lower crustal granulites. Two specimens from The Thumb described by Ehrenberg and Griffin (1979) yielded clinopyroxene pressures of 7700 and 6600 bars at the authors' preferred temperature of 650oC, confirming the deep-crustal interpretation. Although one is mafic (THM 253) and the other granitic (THM 223), and although they have quite different garnets and plagioclases, the similarity of the pressures calculated for the two specimens indicates that they were quarried from nearly the same level on the sub-Colorado Plateau geotherm. The garnetclinopyroxene temperature for both of 650\"C is somewhat high for a 20-35 km depth, particularly since the garnet<linopyroxene temperature scale almost always yields lower temperatures than the two-pyroxene scale where they can be compared in a single rock. In view of the difficulty of reequilibration of silicate mineral compositions by diffusion in dry rocks below 800\"C (Ahrens and Schubert, 1975), 650\"C may be a temperature below which readjustment of mineralogic thermometers does not take place even for long time scales.\n\nAccuracy of the barometers Some idea of the potential accuracy of the two geobarometers may be acquired from ancillary field and experimental information on the localities studied here. The pressures of the Nain anorthosite aureole from reaction (A) agree with those obtained from the recent revision of the ferrosilite-fayaliteqtrartz barometer (Bohlen and Boettcher, 1981). The two Scottish localities where the apparent andalusite to sillimanite transition is recorded in thermal aureoles give orthopyroxene pressures at or less than the Holdaway (197I) A12SiO5 triplepoint. The Furua, Tanzania, and Qianxi, northeastern China, terranes contain kyanite as the regional A12SiO5 polymorph, and the reaction (A) pressures satisfy this condition with respect to the experimental Al2SiO5 diagram (Fig. 1). All of the other large Precambrian granulite terranes investigated have sillimanite. The Adirondack localities plot a short distance into the kyanite field, but theBohlen et aI. (1980) temperatures for these localities were based on two-feldspar and Fe-Ti oxide thermometry, which methods have been criticized (Stoddard, 1980) as yielding temperatures somewhat too low.\n\nAdirondock Lowlonds rs€ Stoddord ( 1976) -l zro\"tro\"c f-^7 s or6 a G 700 800\n\nTemperolure (\"C) Fig. 2. Calculated pressures of four orthopyroxene-garnetplagioclase-quartz assemblages in basic rocks from the Adirondack Lowlands, analyzed by Stoddard (1976), as functions of assumed temperature. Note the slight dependence on temperature. The pressure band width for four interbedded metapelites, containing ganret-sillimanite-plagioclase-quartz, arialyzed by Stoddard (1976), were calculated by the method of Haselton and Newton (1981). The crossing area of the bands defined by the two barometers is consistent with the estimate of 730\"+30\"C of Stoddard (1976) for the metamorphism. Also, a kyanite locality in the central Adirondacks (Boone, 1978) indicates that the kyanite field was approached during metamorphism.\n\nIn several areas the orthopyroxene barometer of reaction (A) can be compared with the metapelite barometer based on garnet-plagioclase-sillimaniteqrnrtz calibrated by Newton and Haselton (1981). Figure 2 shows the d,PldT lines generated by the latter and the reaction (A) barometers for several rocks from the Adirondack Lowlands (Stoddard, 1976;1980). These axe all of the suitable rocks analyzed by Stoddard, (1976) except for a fifth metapelite, #75-C94, which plots about one kbar lower than the others, and is thought to be anomalous. The near temperature independence of the reaction (A) barometer is evident. The two barometers give consistent pressures of 5.5-6.5 kbar in the temperature range 730o+30'C judged appropriate on the basis of eight geothermometers by Stoddard (1980). The migmatitic character of the Adirondack Lowlands rocks is consistent with the experimentally-determined temperature of the beginning of melting of the assemblage biotite-K-feldsparqaaftz in the presence of H2HO2 vapors (Wendlandt, 1981), which is about 740\"C at 5-6 kbar. Table 3 gives comparisons of the average reaction (A) pressures for several localities with the Newton-Haselton barometer. The agreement seems to be good.\n\nIn summary, the calculated pressures of the orthopyroxene barometer appear to be consistent with most of the independent information for the localities where comparisons are possible.\n\nThe clinopyroxene or reaction (B) barometer consistently yields pressures two kbar lower than the reaction (A) barometers for rocks that contain both pyroxenes. Some of the reaction (B) pressures would not be in good agreement with the A12SiO5 experimental diagram or other reliable barometers. For instance, amphibolite 74-C-2488B of the Adirondack Lowlands transitional granulite region yields a reaction (B) pressure of 4.2 kbar, which is considerably lower than pressures for this locality calculated from the other barometers. This lack of agreement indicates that the reaction (A) barometer is of superior accuracy. 730 750 74s 675 7772 6176 7798 6844 5823 8177 5933* z 5 * NegLecte one roek tith a ealatT,ated pressure of 10,5 kbat Precision of the barometers\n\nThe orthopyroxene pressures for the six Adirondack Highlands rocks show a standard deviation of -t-600 bars, and those of the Otter Lake area of -f 1100 bars. These figures might indicate the precision of the method were it not for the possibility that some of the apparent scatter is actually real variation of the crystallization pressure. This possibility may be explored with samples having the requisite assemblage but many different bulk compositions, gathered from closely-spaced localities which appear to be structurally contiguous. Data this comprehensive are not yet available from any of the granulite localities.\n\nAnother possible reason for the discrepancy between barometers (A) and (B) is preferential clinopyroxene reequilibration to lower pressures en route to the surface. Evidence on this is provided by the two-pyroxene garnet granulite LT-2 from the Letseng-la-Terae kimberlite, Lesotho (Grifin et al., 1979). This is a \"quenched\" sample; that is, the travel time to the surface is negligible on a geological time scale. The reaction (A) and (B) barometers show, nevertheless, the discrepancy characteristic of the Precambrian massif two-pyroxene garnet granulites (Table 2). This would seem to indicate that the discrepancy lies in the thermodynamic formulation or input parameters, rather than in real differences in pressure indication. Lines of evidence that the geobarometric minerals commonly retain their peak metamorphic compositions through the slow ascent to the surface are the usual lack of zonation of pyroxenes, plagioclase, and, often, of garnets, and the indication that when reequilibration at lower pressures does occur, the result is usually symplectites or coronas of pyroxenes, plagioclase, and, sometimes, garnets of compositions greatly different from the primary assemblage.\n\nRe adjus t ed g eob arome t er expre s sions Evidence has been presented that the diference in pressure indication of the reaction (A) and (B) barometers is not due to real pressure differences of final equilibration before closure of individual minerals. The possibility is strong that the discrepancy has its source in the thermodynamics of expressions (12), either in the magnitudes of the AGr quantities or in the validities of the activity expressions. The lack of correlation of the amount of pressure discrepancy with compositions of the minerals argues against the latter possibility. The average pressure discrepancy is thus in the AGo's. The estimated uncertainties of the two barometers due to AG\" uncertainties are i1500 bars for the orthopyroxene barometer and 11600 bars for the clinopyroxene barometer, and these AGo uncertainities are almost equally distributed between AIf and AS'factors in the neighborhood of 1000 K.\n\nIn order to arrive at an unbiased pressure estimate based on the reaction (A) and (B) barometers for rocks containing both pyroxenes one could simply average the two independent calculations. This would result in a pressure that is usually within 1.2 kbar of each individual calculation. Since the orthopyroxene (reaction A) pressures seem to agree with most other independent evidence, one could weight the average by raisin_g the reaction (B) pressure to the limit of the AGsuncertainty and by lowering the reaction (A) pressure a small amount. The two barometers would read the same pressure, on the average, for two-pyroxene rocks if 1600 bars are added to expression (12) (cpx) and 600 bars are subtracted from expression (12) (opx). However, such adjustments are empirical and necessarily subjective, and are left to the reader's discretion.\n\nThe five-fold classification of granulite localities adopted here is supported by the more or less characteristic pressure ranges found for each class' The aureole granulites are of shallow origin and perhaps should be considered in the pyroxene hornfels facies, rather than the granulite facies. The low pressures found for the Nain anorthosite aureole confirm the model of Berg (1977) and Emslie (1978), who advocated a high-level emplacement for the Labrador and Grenville magmatic complexes, followed by a high pressure metamorphic overprint for the complexes within the Grenville belt' The granulite terranes classified as transitional between amphibolite facies and granulite facies give somewhat lower pressures than the granulite massif areas, which cluster in the range 8.9-l-1.5 kbar. The regions of strong modern uplift, such as Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, and the aureole of the Ronda Complex, Spain, give very high pressures which correspond to the base of the continental crust.

The pressurFtemperature indications of these cannot together be interpreted as describing a Phanerozoic continental geotherm since some of them are from areas of abundant magmatism where geotherms are likely to be perturbed, and some of the samples may actually be magmatic cognates. Also, the cut-off temperatures below which granulite samples may continue to reequilibrate may be higher than the present normal sub-continent geothermal curve, in which case temperature-pressure indications of some deep-crustal exotics may be fossilized from earlier times.\n\nFigure 3 shows weighted average pressures of regional Precambrian granulite terranes, with 600 bars subtracted from equation (12) (opx) and 1600 bars added to equation (12) (cpx). Although this adjustment is arbitrary, it allows data for both reactions (A) and (B) to be used in a mutually consistent way. The pressures, as well as the temperatures, of the granulite terranes classified as transitional average lower than those of the massifs (homogeneous high grade areas). This enhances the hypothesis that the granulite terranes are related to lower grade terranes by overprinted progressive metamorphism, rather than by initial differences, magmatic fractionation, or mobilizate and restite fractions of partial melting, as other current hypoth-eses propose. An average Precambrian geotherm might be constructed by drawing a P-T line between the centroids of the transitional granulites and the massif granulites in Figure 3. However, the relationship between transitional granulite terranes and massifs may be something other than a simple depth-zone arrangement. A model commonly proposed for metamorphism in the Adirondacks is continental collision and crustal doubling (e.g. Mclelland and Isachsen, 1980). For this model strong lateral temperature and pressure gradients may be expected in the vicinity of the ancient suture zone.\n\nThe origin of ancient granulite terranes has long been a subject of speculation and controversy. A new aspect of the problem is provided by the narrow spread of pressure calculations (8.9-F1.5 kbar) for twelve different massif localities. The nearly constant pressures cannot simply be the result of progressive excavation over time by deep erosion in shield areas to expose a \"granulite level\" at the present time, for several reasons. One is that the high-grade rocks are often demonstrably metasedimentary and thus went through an upper crustal history prior to being buried to some thirty kilometers. Some explicit tectonic mechanism must be invoked to explain this great burial. The second is that the terranes considered here span the time interval from 3675 m.y. (Qianxi Complex) to 1000 m. y. (Adirondack Highlands). There is no apparent relation between depth of metamorphism and antiquity which would be implied by the progressive excavation theory. Instead, the strong implication is that a specific tectonic mechanism of metamorphism was operative in the Precambrian which still may be operative today but whose effects may be somewhat diferent than in the past because of reduced geothermal gradients or reduced intensity of action. Such a mechanism is continental overriding during collision, as has been proposed for the apparently double crustal thickness at the juncture between Asia and the Indian subcontinent (Powell and Conaghan, 1975) and for high pressure metamorphism in the Alps (Richardson and England 1979). This hypothesis explains the repeated 7-10 kbar pressures as the result of effectively instantaneous loading of a continental margin with a 30-km thickness of another continent. Continental shelf sedimentary facies, recumbent overfolding and subhorizontal foliations, and COz fluid inclusions (from\n\nAdircndock,.-OsitlomDundl aisnong.D4 sgrgli^ ^ \"ili:[ #i:, ^.zdwsororrs >ogotv qv,, --ffi\"{ \" \"jcii'o'\"ia\"u.l. \"to\"'t o,ro,,oo ohiilt Lohe. r*,i1r,\"? -$QQ;\";i\"'ao Adirondocka ^ Sierro Ieone-Ruby qonqe(K) Lowlonds ^ : -xuDy ronqet> I\n\ndestruction of shelf carbonates), all nearly ubiquitous characteristics of ancient granulite terranes, are explainable by this mechanism (Newton and Hansen, 1981).\n\nNature of the lower continental crust Speculation about the lower continental crust has focussed on certain exposed granulite terranes as possible actual lower crustal sections, tectonically uplifted. The ancient granulite massifs have been put forward as a model largely because of their low intrinsic heat production, which is a necessary condition for the low heat-flow shield terranes (Heier, 1973). However, it seems unlikely that this is a generally valid model because of the ubiquitous supracrustal rocks, which are found in all Precambrian granulite terranes, sometimes as dominant components, as in the Sri Lanka Highland Series (Cooray, 1962). The interbanded pelitic granulitemafic granulite sequence of the Ivrea Zone, northern Italy, has also been regarded as an actual deepcrustal section (Mehnert, 1975). A strong positive gravity anomaly over the granulites has been cited as evidence of near-surface upper mantle, but the anomaly could also be explained by a large gabbro intrusion under the granulite sequence (Schmid and Wood, 1976). The low pressures of 6.0+0.8 kbar computed by Newton and Haselton (1981) from the as se mblage garnet-plagioclas e-sillimanite-quartz in Ivrea Zone metapelites indicates that the exposure is not the basal section of a crust of normal thickness. A third model is the mafic granulite tract of the Doubtful Sound area, New Zealand (Oliver, 1976). In addition to being petrologically similar to the mafic granulites of explosive pipe nodule suites, commonly of plagioclase-clinopyroxen+garnet-hornblende+scapolite-r qtrartz mineralogy (e.5. Rogers and Nixon, 1975), the pressures calculated here for the Doubtful Sound rocks are equivalent to approximately 40 km depth in a crust of average density 2.8 gm/cm3. This fact, together with the profound gravity high over the area, suggests strongly that the Doubtful Sound granulites are indeed an actual deep-crustal array. The mechanisn of modern strong uplift, exhibited in some granulite terranes, which elevates a lower crustal section, or, in the case of the Ronda peridotite, a subcrustal sequence, remains obscure."
