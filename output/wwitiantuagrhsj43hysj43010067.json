    "abstract": "Despite having the same snowmelt processes, snowpacks in urban environments experience a range of conditions different from those of rural areas. Melt is intensified at some sites due to greater radiative energy. Shading, however, can reduce radiation and melt at other sites. Changes to the radiation balance and snowpack processes have been investigated. A physical snowpack model was developed and tested against data from an impervious study plot in Sweden. Estimated surface runoff compared favourably with that measured. An urban radiation scheme captured the observed net allwave radiation well. Series of sensitivity analyses were made by perturbing the scheme to represent three urban locations: open ground and the southern (sunny) and north (shaded) sides of a hypothetical building. Cloudiness, albedo, wall temperature and sky view were altered to reproduce common urban conditions. Even without perturbation, the shaded and sunny sides of the building had different radiation fluxes-the south side experienced a daily average net radiation enhancement of 15 W m-2 and the north a decrease of 35 W m-2. This pattern was reflected in melt. Perturbation exaggerated the disparity.\nSensibilité de la fonte des neiges au rayonnement en milieu urbain\nOpen for discussion until",
    "full_text": "Snow is an integral part of the faydrological cycle in the mid-to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere where it represents a substantial seasonal water store and can account for over 50% of the annual precipitation. Snowmelt can be the cause of severe flooding in the urban environment, not so much as a consequence of high melt intensities as to the long duration of water delivery, impervious surfaces and changed, more direct flow paths. Indeed, northern Sweden experiences its most severe urban flooding during spring melt. Despite its importance, snow has been largely ignored by researchers considering urban hydrology. Rainfall events have enjoyed the lion's share of study, both because rainfall intensities are greater than those of melt and because snow hydrology is perceived to be the same in rural and urban sites. Some exceptions include Bengtsson (1983), Westerstrôm (1984), Bengtsson & Westerstrôm (1992) in Sweden, and Buttle & Xu (1988), Xu & Buttle (1987) and Buttle (1990) in Canada.\n\nThere is no shortage of snow accumulation and melt models of various complexities in the literature. However, these have tended to have been developed and tested in alpine regions. While the governing processes involved in both urban and rural snow hydrology are the same, the snow, climatic and surface characteristics in the urban environment are different. Hence the energy balance and runoff generation also differ. Melt can be both more or less intense as a result of the changed energy availability. The urban climate is highly heterogeneous and, as a result, snow accumulation and melt conditions form a mosaic over the landscape. For instance, buildings alter regional radiative, moisture, aerodynamic and thermal properties. The impacts are spatially variable and depend on, amongst other factors, building orientation, the degree of shading, building materials and albedo.\n\nThis paper is a preliminary study of snow hydrology in urban environments and is organized into three main parts. Firstly, it gives a review of the peculiarities involved in snowmelt modelling. Secondly, routines to estimate snow surface melt, runoff from the snowpack base and radiation are presented. The physically-based energy balance melt model was forced by hourly climatic data and was validated against four weeks of snow data from a 200 m 2 impervious study plot located in the north of Sweden. This model then simulated melt from three hypothetical urban locations representing open ground and the northern (shaded) and southern (sunny) sides of a building. The simple radiation model was used to simulate the radiation balance expected at these generalized locations. Finally, the effect of the urban environment, including cloud cover, snow albedo and distance from buildings, on the radiation balance, and, as a consequence, snowmelt processes is demonstrated in a series of sensitivity analyses.\n\nThe net allwave radiative flux, Q*, in urban areas can differ dramatically from nearby rural areas due to changes in atmospheric and ground surface conditions. Increased cloud cover associated with urban areas blocks incoming solar radiation but enhances atmospheric longwave radiation. Air pollution above large cities alters Q* in a similar way (Rouse et al., 1973). Like the terrain effects of alpine topography, the \"canyon\" configuration of buildings interspersed with roads can serve to enhance the energy balance by trapping radiation.\n\nIn the absence of snow, advected heat can reasonably be ignored in central urban sites where the land use is not variable (Oke, 1987). However, when snow is on the ground, advection from warmer snow-free surfaces could serve to increase energy availability. Building materials, for example, tend to have high sensible heat storage leading to horizontal sensible heat transfer. Combustion is also a significant urban heat source and is a direct consequence of human decisions which responds only indirectly to solar activity. This source can be significant in comparison with Q* during winter in the mid-to high latitudes, particularly in cities with high population densities.\n\nSnowmelt in the high latitudes or alpine regions can usually be attributed to the radiation budget of the snowpack (e.g. Price, 1988;Marks & Dozier, 1992). In general, the net radiation of a high latitude snowpack is dominated by longwave radiation during winter and shortwave radiation during spring when sun elevations are higher and days are longer. Xu & Buttle (1987) reported that net radiation in a Canadian suburb could be enhanced by between 67 and 435% resulting in higher intensity melt rates. Results obtained in Sweden show a similar pattern with increases of 10 to 100 W itf 2 (Bengtsson & Westerstrôm, 1992).\n\nIncoming, or incident, shortwave radiation is significantly reduced in areas with air pollution and the ratio of direct to diffuse solar radiation decreases. The albedo of urban surfaces differs sharply from that of their rural counterparts, partly due to the lower albedo of materials such as wood, brick and asphalt and partly due to building geometry (Takamura & Toritani, 1994). Thus, the outgoing or reflected shortwave radiation is lowered. The urban canyon, with its reduced sky view, increased surface area and multiple reflections, serves to farther increase the absorption. In the absence of snow, decreases in incoming shortwave radiation are offset by the increased shortwave absorption to some extent and differences between net solar radiation in rural and urban environments, as a whole, are minimized. However, solar irradiation for an individual ground point is highly dependent on location; the orientation of neighbouring buildings to the sun plays a crucial role due to shading.\n\nSnowy conditions accentuate the disparity between the albedoes of rural and urban areas; the overall effect is that the warm areas surrounding urban snowpacks cause increased emittance of longwave radiation. Horizontal rural surfaces such as arable land are more evenly covered by snow and have a high albedo resulting in a single reflection, whereas the urban canyons are free of snow in the vertical plane. Additionally, sloped streets and roofs are usually snow-free at the onset of significant melt (Buttle & Xu, 1988;Westerstrôm, 1984). Irregular deposition, redistribution, clearance and salting also decrease the albedo of the snowpack's surroundings.\n\nThere are significant differences in the albedo values of urban and rural snowpacks themselves. In rural areas the albedo typically ranges from 0.8 for fresh dry snow to 0.6 at the onset of melt and 0.4 for old wet snow (US Army Corps of Engineers, 1956). These values are lower in urban environments. Snow albedo is dependant on sun elevation, cloudiness, grain structure, depth, underlying surface albedo and impurities. Dirt and pollution are quickly incorporated into urban snow causing lower albedo, particularly in the vicinity of roads and access ways.\n\nTo investigate the effect on albedo of natural and anthropogenic aerosols, Conway et al. (1996) spread known concentrations of snow and particle mixtures onto the surface of several coarse-grained snowpack plots. Small particles tended to be washed out of the pack. However, residual particles in the surface layer remained for several weeks decreasing the albedo by 30% and increasing ablation by 50%. Larger particles persisted on the surface for a longer period, significantly reducing the albedo. Bengtsson & Westerstrôm (1992) compared the albedo of snowpacks within Luleâ, Sweden, including parks, central and suburban plots. They found that the albedo of the urban snowpacks prior to melt was slightly lower than that for rural plots. However, in all the plots, except an untouched suburban snowpack, the albedo rapidly decreased by proportion consistent with the drop reported by Conway et al. (1996).\n\nCloud, warm air temperatures and pollution increase incoming atmospheric longwave radiation over cities and longwave radiation is emitted by buildings. Furthermore, the canyon configuration tends to obscure the sky view causing reabsorption of terrestrial radiation from both the ground and surrounding buildings and a consequent increase in the net longwave radiation at the ground level (Oke, 1987).\n\nAt freezing temperatures, fresh snow behaves as a black body for infrared wavelengths. For air temperatures well above freezing, the incoming longwave radiation is not matched by the outgoing longwave radiation which has an upper limit corresponding to a maximum snow temperature of 0°C. Hence, the net longwave radiation can be a substantial source of energy to snowmelt (Price & Petzold, 1984). In the absence of solar inputs, longwave exchanges dominate the radiation budget of cold snowpacks in open areas (Granger & Gray, 1990). The principles are the same for snow in enclosed areas; however the exchange, as was discussed, is complicated by longwave radiation emitted from the surroundings. Longwave radiation emitted from trees can account for much of the snowmelt in shaded forested areas. Price & Petzold (1984) found that sun-warmed forest leaves could have temperatures 12°C in excess of the ambient air temperature. Similarly, longwave radiation emitted from warmed buildings can be expected to have an influence on snowmelt. Xu & Buttle (1987) measured the net radiation in the vicinity of two single family dwellings and found that 8 m from buildings the net allwave radiation, largely through longwave radiation, could be 1.5 times greater than that in open areas. They cite the formation during the later stages of melt of \"motes\" of bare ground around buildings as evidence of enhanced longwave radiation.\n\nThere are two categories of snowmelt models: temperature index and energy balance models. The former conceptually relate melt to daily air temperature and are often used for operational catchment modelling. Energy balance models are physicallybased and calculate the energy fluxes into and out of the snow cover. Energy balance models can give accurate short-term estimates for points or small catchments and can be distinguished further as either snowpack or snow surface energy models depending on whether the meltwater percolation and internal energy exchanges are calculated.\n\nThe conceptual HBV model, which contains a temperature index, was applied with some success to Gâvle in Sweden in order to simulate inflow into the municipal waste water system (Lidén, personal communication, 1996). Despite this, Bengtsson (1984) showed that snowmelt from heterogeneous urban areas cannot adequately be determined from temperature indices. For a temperature index to be justifiable, the runoff generated must be the result of several days of melt {ibid.); this is not the case in urban catchments where impervious surfaces cause rapid response. Additionally, an energy balance approach is more suitable for sensitivity analyses. Thus, a surface energy balance model was applied here. Model calculations are made on an hourly time step. Model inputs are ambient air temperature, humidity and wind speed; all at 2 m. Snow surface temperature is equated to air temperature at 0.4 m above the snow surface during sub-freezing periods and 0°C when the air temperature is above zero.\n\nThe energy balance of a snowpack is given by Anderson (1976) as:\n\nwhere Q T0T = total heat flux density of the snowpack (W m\" 2 ); Q* -net allwave radiation flux density (W rn\" 2 ); Q H = turbulent sensible heat flux density (W itf 2 ); Q E = turbulent latent heat flux density (W m\" 2 ); Q G = subsurface heat flux density (W m~2); and Q P = advected heat flux from precipitation (W m\" 2 ).\n\nThe temperature gradient at the snow/soil interface is usually small, so Q G is negligible (in the order of 1-5 W m\" 2 ) in comparison to the other terms (Marks & Dozier, 1992) and is not considered here. The turbulent exchange of latent and sensible heat is calculated here using standard physical formulae (Anderson, 1976). It is assumed that the wind profile is logarithmic and that conditions are neutral and stable, hence, the turbulent transfer coefficients of water vapour over momentum and heat over momentum are considered to be at unity. An aerodynamic roughness length of 2 x 10\" 3 m was used. The absolute humidity is determined from the relative humidity and air temperature and the air at the snow surface is assumed to be saturated. While evaporative losses from a snow cover are small, the latent heat flux can be a loss of energy to melt (Bengtsson, 1980).\n\nPrecipitation heat is delivered when rain falls directly on the snowpack. This heat flux is relatively small in comparison to the radiative and turbulent fluxes. However, the energy supplied can be substantial in cold packs as latent heat is released upon freezing. For simplicity, equation (2) assumes that rain entering the pack is cooled to 0°C but remains liquid and is routed as an addition to meltwater.\n\nwhere p w = density of water (kg m\" 3 J); c w = specific heat of water (J kg\" 1 K\" 1 ); P = rate of liquid precipitation (water equivalents) (m s\" 1 ); and T a = air temperature (K).\n\nThe snowpack energy status varies over the day and can be positive or negative depending on the exchanges dominating the radiation budget. When the total energy flux is positive, surface melt for each time step is calculated as:\n\nwhere M = surface melt rate (m s\" 1 ); Q T0T = total heat flux density of the snowpack (W mf 2 ); and F = latent heat of fusion (J kg\" 1 ).\n\nGenerally, snow can have two states: cold/dry (<0°C) or warm/wet (0°C). Surface meltwater can leave the base of a snowpack only after the pack is isothermal at 0°C and after the irreducible water content (the maximum fraction of liquid water that a snowpack can hold without the water being released by gravitational forces) is reached. Thus, initial energy inputs warm the snow to melting point and the amount of energy required is known as the cold content, Co. Furthermore, the first meltwater generated is held in the snowpack until the entire snowpack is at maximum water storage. Due to refreezing and retention, the time taken for meltwater release can be considerable, especially if the pack is initially dry and nights are freezing cold.\n\nAs in most cases, the history of snow accumulation for the snow season modelled here is unknown. This and the complex pattern of urban snow deposition, redistribtion, metamorphosis and compaction meant that specific snow layers were not modelled. Instead, the internal processes of retention and refreezing were described by modelling their downwards propagation from the snow surface. Initially, the entire pack is equated to the freezing depth. After Q T0T becomes positive, any meltwater or rain is retained by the snow to a depth defined by the irreducible water content. Water is allowed to refreeze to a certain depth according to the snow properties and the length of time that the snow surface temperature is sub-freezing.\n\nThe process governing refreezing can be written in one dimension as (Bengtsson, 1982):\n\n(4) oz at r s c i at where K = thermal diffusivity of snow (m 2 s\" 1 ), t = time (s), z = depth from the snow surface (m), p s = density of snow (kg iff 3 J), 9 = liquid water content of the snowpack at depth z, and c,-= specific heat of ice (J kg\" 1 K\" 1 ).\n\nThis equation is overly complex and a simplification, described below, was used. Bengtsson (1982) estimated the freezing depth from the surface using a Fourier series expansion of equation ( 4). When the snow surface temperature, T s , is below 0°C, the freezing depth, z f , can be approximated under the assumption of a linear temperature distribution within the snowpack:\n\nwhere AT is a meteorological parameter representing negative degree hours:\n\nand C is a parameter which describes the state of the snowpack:\n\nIn accordance with snow conditions in northern Sweden, the relative snow density, p/p w , is set to 0.3 and the thermal diffusivity is 2 x 10~7 m 2 s\" 1 (Bengtsson, 1982).\n\nThe literature suggests an irreducible water content in the range of 5-10% by volume for fresh snow (e.g. Conway & Benedict, 1994;Kuusisto, 1984). The storage available or rather the irreducible liquid water content of the snowpack, & r , adopted here is 8% for fresh snow and 4% for refrozen snow.\n\nSimilarly, the linear component of cold content for the surface sub-freezing snow layer is (Bengtsson, 1982):\n\nThus, after periods of negative snow surface temperatures, the apparent loss of liquid water generated due to superficial re-freezing can be calculated as the amalgamated effect of the cold content and liquid water retention:\n\nMeltwater which remains is then released. Percolation through a wet snowpack is swift in comparison to lags caused by water retention (Kuusisto, 1984). Bengtsson (1982) found that the time lag for a wet snowpack half a metre deep was in the order of an hour. Hence, percolation was not explicitly modelled, that is, the liquid water leaving the snowpack could be equated to the rain water and surface meltwater for the same period.\n\nThere are few urban measurements of radiation balance components available for the development of a radiation model suitable for snowy conditions. Verseghy & Munro (1989a,b) developed and tested both a detailed and a simplified radiation model for a snow-free urban enclosure in Canada. Observations, again in Canada, of the radiation balance for a snowpack surrounding several buildings were taken by Xu & Buttle (1987). These enabled Todhunter et al. (1992) to validate a radiation model for a static urban snowpack, that is, snowmelt was not modelled. A complex radiation model was beyond the scope of this study. Instead, a less rigorous approach was developed for a hypothetical, free-standing, north/south aligned (east/west axis), brick and glass building. Nonetheless, the method drew heavily on the experiences and simplifying assumptions made by Verseghy & Munro (1989a,b) and Todhunter et al. (1992), particularly in the following cases:\n\n-the hypothetical building was modelled as being vertical, set on an infinite horizontal plane; -the angular distributions of atmospheric and building longwave radiation were assumed to be isotropic rather than anisotropic; -similarly, diffuse and reflected shortwave radiation were assumed to have an isotropic distribution; and -only a single reflection of shortwave radiation between the walls and the snowpack was allowed. The three papers referenced discuss the effects of these simplifications in detail.\n\nA schematic diagram showing how a building can influence the urban radiation balance is presented in Fig. 1. Building height was set to 7 m and the distance of the snowmelt points from the northern and southern wall was set to 4 m. The sky-view factor for this height to distance ratio is 0.75 (Oke, 1987). The proportions of brick and glass were pooled to give weighted area values of 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. The solar and longwave radiation components of the radiation model will be discussed separately.\n\nThe snowpack net shortwave flux was estimated by equations ( 10)-( 13):\n\nwhere K* = net shortwave radiation (W m\" 2 ), Ki = incoming shortwave radiation (W m' 2 ), Kf = outgoing, or reflected, shortwave radiation (W m~2), S = direct beam shortwave radiation (W nï 2 ), D = diffuse shortwave radiation (W m~2), R = shortwave radiation reflected from the ground onto the wall (W m\" 2 ), asurface albedo, and v| / = sky-view factor. Indices b and s are the building and snow surfaces respectively and ( \" ) denotes building energy flux terms. Extraterrestrial shortwave radiation was simulated using standard geometric techniques. This was adjusted to account for losses in the atmosphere to give an estimate of the direct beam shortwave radiation for clear skies. Atmospheric transmissivity was set to 0.84 (Campbell, 1977) and, as the site was near sea level, the optical air mass is a function of the solar elevation.\n\nThe clear sky direct beam shortwave radiation was then adjusted for cloud fraction using the empirical relationship of Granger & Gray (1990) to give S, the incident direct beam shortwave radiation on a horizontal surface. The diffuse or sky shortwave radiation, D, was empirically related to the difference between the extraterrestrial and direct beam solar radiation. Using the cosine law of illumination, the vertical direct beam radiation, S, is a function of S, the solar azimuth angle, aspect and building angle of incidence. The southern side of the building received full direct beam radiation, however, the northern side was assumed to be fully shaded. This assumption is valid as the solar elevation (less than 38° at 1200 noon) encountered in northern Sweden during early spring would cause a building of 7 m to cast a shadow at least 9 m long. The point on this side was assumed to be far enough from the western and eastern sides to be free from direct solar radiation during the morning and evening. For a vertical face, the diffuse radiation from the sky, D, is simply half that of a horizontal surface. In snowy conditions, the calculation of the vertical net solar radiation, K*, is complicated by multiple reflections. A single reflection, R, was allowed here-the calculation of which depends on Ki. The albedo of the snow was taken directly as the ratio between observed incoming and outgoing solar radiation. The outgoing shortwave radiation from the building was calculated as the sum of the shortwave radiation reflected by the brick and glass. The albedo of brick was set to 0.3. The albedo of glass for diffuse solar radiation is 0.16; the albedo for direct solar radiation varies throughout the day; however, low winter sun elevations meant that the albedo could be approximated by a single value, 0.08.\n\nThe net longwave flux at the snowpack surface was estimated with equations ( 14)-( 17):\n\nwhere L* = net longwave radiation (W mf 2 ), Li = incoming longwave radiation (W m 2 ), it = outgoing longwave radiation from a surface (W m~2), T = temperature (K), a = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (W m\" 2 K~4), e = emissivity, and y/ = skyview factor. Indices b and s are the building and snow surfaces respectively and ( \" ) denotes building energy flux terms. Atmospheric emissivity for clear skies was calculated as a function of the ambient air temperature and humidity using an empirical formula (Brutsaert, 1975). This method is attractive as it does not have a restricted temperature range. The flux generated was adjusted for the cloud fraction according to Oke (1987). Clouds were said to be: cirrus on clear days (n/N > 0.7); altocumulus on cloudy days (0.7 > n/N > 0.3); and stratocumulus on overcast days (n/N < 0.3); where n/N is the ratio of observed sunshine hours to those astronomically possible. Longwave losses are dependent on the surface temperature of the snowpack. The emissivity of snow was assigned a value of 0.98.\n\nLongwave radiation emitted by buildings, it, was calculated by equation ( 17). Glass and brick were each assigned an emissivity of 0.9 (Oke, 1987). In the absence of measurements, the temperature of the walls was assumed to be the same as the ambient air temperature. The final term of equation ( 15) is for reflectance of atmospheric longwave radiation from the surface of the building.\n\nLuleâ is a Swedish city on the Baltic coast approximately 100 km south of the Polar Circle. Snow coverage is permanent during the winter months and melt usually occurs in mid-April. Several urban snow hydrology investigations were undertaken in Luleâ during the early to mid-1980s. These have been reported by Bengtsson (1983), Westerstrôm (1984) and Bengtsson & Westerstrôm (1992). The present study was based on climatic and snow data for four weeks during 1980 (31 March-27 April). Hourly records taken from the snow covered site include: -surface runoff from an asphalt surface of 200 m 2 (25m x 8 m); -windspeed measured 1.7 m above the snow surface; -air temperature at 0.4 and 2 m above the snow surface; -relative humidity at the heights above;\n\nincoming and outgoing shortwave radiation, allowing albedo to be directly calculated; and -net allwave radiation.\n\nTwelve continuous hours of missing data on April 4, several days prior to the onset of melt, were reconstructed using the average values for each of those hours derived from 3 and 5 April.\n\nAdditionally, the daily number of sunshine hours for the period was recorded at the local airport some kilometres from the town (SMHI, 1980). The ratio of sunshine hours recorded to those astronomically possible, n/N, was used as a proxy for the daily cloud cover fraction. The use of daily cloud cover in hourly radiation calculations is not generally recommended, however, the use of more suitable, detailed cloud data was not possible.\n\nThe snowmelt and radiation schemes were evaluated against the hourly measurements made at the study plot to ascertain their reliability. The radiation simulation (shown with cloud fraction in Fig. 2) was able to capture the pattern of net allwave radiation for the snowpack accurately with a correlation coefficient of J? 2 =0.90. Net solar radiation was extremely well modelled. While the general pattern of atmospheric longwave radiation was well simulated, there was a tendency for the observed net longwave radiation to fluctuate greatly, particularly at night. It is possible that there was a problem with the measurement of net allwave radiation. As net longwave radiation was taken as the balance between measured net allwave and net shortwave radiation, and as longwave losses were bounded by an upper temperature limit of 0°C for snow, a net radiation error would account for unexpected values of incoming longwave radiation given the temperature, humidity and cloud conditions. Indeed, the atmospheric emissivity derived from observations were extremely low in some cases. The night-time radiation budget was not used in later calculations, so the discrepancies are not discussed further.\n\nAs expected, the contribution to the total amount of energy available for melt from the turbulent exchange was low in comparison to the net radiation. The respective average daytime values were 8 W m\" 2 and 100 W nf 2 .\n\nThe runoff from the asphalt surfaced study plot was fairly well simulated by the surface melt and internal process routines (Fig. 3). Flow from the base of the snowpack could be equated to the surface runoff from the impervious asphalt surface when the snowpack was wet. However, on the basis of correlation analysis, a 5-hour -Observed runoff -Estimated runoff Date Fig. 3 Observed runoff generated over an asphalt surface against simulated runoff estimated using recorded net allwave radiation.\n\ntriangular filter was used to smooth the generated flow in order to simulate the time lag of several hours between the water exiting the snowpack and the runoff from the entire 25 m long surface. The days on which significant runoff commenced and ceased were correct. The use of daily cloud fractions reconstructed from sunshine hours could cause some of the discrepancies seen in Fig. 3. For instance, the jagged appearance of the measured shortwave and all wave radiation peaks on 17 and 18 April attests that the daily cloud fraction was not constant. These days were among the most poorly modelled for the simulated radiation record. The correlation coefficient (i? 2 ) was 0.71.\n\nThe initial results demonstrated that the above described routines performed adequately. They formed the basis of four series of numerical experiments designed to mimic snowmelt conditions which could be expected at three generalized urban locations:\n\n-an open area isolated from the influence of buildings; an area lying to the south of the hypothetical building which receives direct beam radiation without obstruction; and -a fully shaded area lying to the north of the hypothetical building.\n\nThe snowpack had completely melted by 24 April; thereafter snow albedo was not available, and hence the analyses are reported only to this point. Unless otherwise stated, model parameters were the same as those defined previously. Urban heat island effects were not simulated.\n\nCloudiness and pollution in urban centres can be greater than in rural areas causing diminished shortwave and increased longwave radiation. The ratio of sunshine hours recorded to those possible was arbitrarily decreased by one to three tenths in decrements of one tenth. While such a blanket change was unlikely, the analysis could illustrate the direction of sensitivity.\n\nThe snow albedo recorded at the study plot varied over the day and had a mean daily value prior to melt of 0.67 which was reduced to 0.49 during the melt period. These values are comparable with those for rural snow, indicating that the snowpack was clean. The albedo was reduced to simulate the high levels of dirt and pollution incorporated into urban snowpacks. Systematic reductions in the range of 10-40%, in 10% steps, were made in accordance with published studies and personal experience.\n\nThe assumption that the external wall surface temperature is equal to the ambient air temperature is overly simplistic. Solar loading and internal heating, for example, can increase the temperature considerably. Todhunter et al. (1992) state that wall/ambient and inter-wall temperature differences are at their maximum during winter due to shadowing and solar-receptor geometry effects. They used an iterative solution of the steady state energy balance equation to determine the equilibrium wall temperatures. Verseghy & Munro (1989a,b) used a Barnes PRT-5 radiometer to find the equivalent black-body temperature. Rearrangements of equations ( 15) and ( 17) for wall temperature were applied to several observations of longwave radiation made in Luleâ, at distances of up to 10m from a two storey building, and at a rural site five kilometres distant during April 1980 (Bengtsson & Westerstrôm, 1992). On cloudy days, the extra radiation received at the urban site equated to a wall temperature in the range of 3-5°C warmer than the ambient air temperature. On clear days, when the atmospheric emissivity was lower, the disparity was greater, even in the absence of direct sunshine (10-17 W m\" 2 or c. 7°C). Solar loading caused an increase in longwave radiation which amounted to a wall temperature at least 14 °C warmer than the surrounding air.\n\nFor this experiment, the air temperature was perturbed to obtain an estimate of the wall temperature according to the scheme below: (i) the temperature of both the northern and southern walls was increased by 7°C regardless of the cloud fraction or time of day; (ii) the temperature of both the northern and southern walls was increased by 7°C when the cloud fraction was less than 0.5 and 3° C when the cloud fraction was greater than 0.5 regardless of the time of day; and (iii)to reproduce the effect of solar loading the southern wall had an increase of 3°C during cloudy periods, 7°C during clear nights and 20°C on clear days using the criteria above.\n\nThe distance of the snowmelt point from the wall was altered in increments of 2 m from 2 to 10 m in accordance with both Buttle & Xu (1988) and Bengtsson & Westerstrôm (1992). The approximate sky-view factors for a 7 m high building were 0.64, 0.75, 0.83, 0.88 and 0.91 for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 m respectively.\n\nThe presence of the hypothetical building caused radical differences in the radiation balance encountered at each location-even when the properties investigated were not altered. This is evident in the daily net all wave radiation chart (Fig. 4(a)). Incoming longwave radiation to the snowpacks on both sides of the building were enhanced due to the greater emissivity of brick and glass compared to the atmosphere. On a day with an atmospheric emissivity of 0.84 and an ambient air temperature of 0 °C, the longwave enhancement would be approximately 5.5 W m 2 or 1.5 mm day 1 of surface melt. The net solar radiation was enhanced slightly during sunny days on the southern side as a consequence of the reflection from the walls of shortwave radiation; however, lower sky view meant that K* was more likely to be less on cloudy days. The maximum average daily enhancement was 8.3 W m 2 , the maximum loss was 12 W m 2 (2 and 3 mm day 4 surface melt respectively). In contrast, the northern side always showed a decrease in K* due to the shading of direct beam solar radiation. The maximum drop in daily average allwave radiation was 58 W m~2 (15 mm day'). All three locations had similar irradiance on cloudy days when shortwave radiation was diffuse, with the two building sites displaying a slight enhancement by virtue of the longwave radiation.\n\nRunoff was increased on the southern side on most days. Higher peaks were achieved on sunny days such as 11 and 12 April (ca. 3 mm each). The enhancement caused earlier depletion of the snow cover and, thus, lower runoff on 22 April. Runoff on the northern side was always substantially lower (Fig. 4(b)); indeed, less than half of the snowpack was estimated to melt by the end of the observation period. Runoff simulated from the northern side commenced on the same day as the open site, largely due to the overcast skies during the first five or so days.\n\nThe influence of cloud cover on radiation varied over the three sites (Fig. 5(a)), noting, of course, that days which were already completely overcast registered no change. The joint effect of cloud on K* and L* is seen at the open site. With an increase in cloud cover of one-tenth, the daily average net solar radiation dropped 15 W mf 2 (4 mm day 4 ) on clear days. The loss was counteracted by an increase in longwave radiation (3-11 W irf 2 ), which on days already cloudy, caused an increase in net allwave radiation. The pattern at the building sites was complicated by the walls. Increased cloud fraction was associated with lower direct beam and greater diffuse shortwave radiation. Direct beam radiation was not blocked on the southern side, however, so the received diffuse radiation was reduced according to the skyview factor. What increases in absorbed longwave radiation there were, were not enough to halt an overall decrease in radiative energy. The same mechanism had the opposite effect on the northern side (Fig. 5(c)). Here, the building completely blocked the direct solar beam and net shortwave radiation was a function of the diffuse radiation; the more cloud cover, the greater the horizontal and vertical diffuse, net shortwave and net allwave radiation. The enhancement of allwave radiation was up to 9 W m\" 2 (2.3 mm day\" 1 ) for a cloud fraction change of one-tenth.\n\nChanges in runoff are shown in Fig. 6. As could be expected from the changes to the total radiative energy, daily runoff decreased at the open site (Fig. 6(a)) and melt was incomplete at the end of the analysis period. The increases in allwave radiation on moderately cloudy days did not cause corresponding increases in runoff. Likewise, the southern side showed the same general pattern (Fig. 6(b)). The increased sensitivity of net shortwave radiation to cloud, due to the shading of diffuse radiation, was evident in the runoff estimated. Runoff on the northern side was more sensitive to cloud cover (Fig. 6(c)) and increased in most instances. By the end of the observation period, roughly 10 mm more of the snowpack would melt with each tenth cloud cover added.\n\nThe effect of albedo on the modelled melt was consistent with the observations of albedo and ablation by Conway et al. (1996). The amount of shortwave radiation absorbed by the snow increased at all sites often causing dramatic increases in the available energy. The pattern of irradiance and runoff was extremely similar for the open and southern sites. At these sites, which received direct beam radiation, the net allwave radiation as much as doubled when albedo was reduced by 40%. The average increase in net solar radiation for a 40% decrease in albedo was 26 W m~2 (6.7 mm day\" 1 surface melt) for the open site and 23 W m\" 2 (6 mm day 4 ) for the southern side. Increases of over 30 W nf 2 were not uncommon at both these sites and a change of 10% gave rise to an average daily enhancement of 6 W m~2 (1.7 mm day\" 1 ). The shaded northern site also had greater absorption; there was a daily average enhancement of 13 W mf 2 (3.5 mm day 4 ) for the 40% decrease.\n\nLowered albedo caused a shift in the timing of runoff at the unshaded sites. Meltwater was released from the pack one to four days earlier, while the snowpack disappeared from one (10%) to six (40%) days earlier. The daily runoff generated rose sharply with increases in the order of 2 (10%) to 8 (40%) mm per day.\n\nAs with the other sites, runoff at the northern site increased with lower albedoes. This site received similar amounts of solar radiation during the first few days of the analysis period which were overcast. Hence, like the other sites, melt began early for the 20-40% albedo drops. With the maximum decrease in albedo, over two-thirds of the snowpack would have melted and ran off by the end of the analysed period.\n\nLongwave radiation enhancement on both sites was dependent only on the wall temperature. With an ambient air temperature of 0 °C and an atmospheric emissivity of 0.84, the increases in longwave radiation 4 m from the wall were 9, 14 and 31 W m\" 2 respectively for wall temperatures 3, 7 and 20°C warmer. These increases, given that the maximum wall temperature was possible only during daylight hours, corresponded to surface melts of 2.3, 3.5 and 4 mm per day in excess of those with wall temperatures set to the air temperature. At both sites, the increase in net longwave and, therefore, net allwave radiation was more or less constant for the 3 and Wall to site distance\n\nThe influence of buildings decreases with distance. Net ailwave radiation was greatest on both sides close to the walls (Figs 8(a) and (b)), largely due to the longwave radiation emitted by the wall surface. The longwave component was in the order of 20 to 30 W m\" 2 (5-8 mm day\" 1 surface melt) more at 2 m from the building than that at 10 m distant on both sides. The pattern of net shortwave radiation nearer the building was similar on both sides-net shortwave radiation being increased with distance due to lower sky-view factors. On both sides the diffuse solar radiation received was dependent on the sky-view factor which diminished near the vertical walls. Indeed, the greatest differences (9-12 W m 2 , 2-3 mm day\" 1 ) in solar radiation on both sides occur on cloudy days when much of this radiation was diffuse. The losses of diffuse solar radiation were counterbalanced by longwave radiation enhancement and the total increase of ailwave radiation moving from 10 to 2 m from the walls was on average 15 W m\" 2 on the southern side and 10 W mf 2 to the north.\n\nThe effect on melt and runoff (not shown here) of distance was less apparent on both sides of the building. On the southern side, for all the distances except 10 m, runoff commenced and finished on the same day and the peaks and troughs were of similar magnitudes, those closer to the building being steeper. Daily runoff was slightly greater closer to the wall; the increased peaks at 6-10 mm on the last day was, again, due to deeper snow cover rather than energy availability. The spatial distribution of energy on the northern side was not enough to change runoff significantly after cold content and water retention were satisfied.\n\nThe urban landscape is highly heterogeneous in comparison to rural landscapes. The research presented here focused on the areal disparity of the radiative fluxes. The respective roles of long-and shortwave radiation to snowmelt processes were discussed both separately and together. The sensitivity of the snowpack to the radiation budget, depending on location, was then explored. A mathematical, physically-based snowmelt model, which included a joint provision for liquid water refreezing and retention, was forced with the net allwave radiation obtained from a simple urban point radiation model. Both routines were validated against Swedish data from an open site and were found to perform reliably with correlation coefficients of 0.71 and 0.90 respectively.\n\nThree classes of urban location, with reference to a hypothetical building, were simulated; an open site and the southern (full-sun) and the northern (shadowed) sides of a building. Relative to the open site, both the northern and southern snowpacks were likely to have increased longwave radiation due to the presence of the walls, but the diffuse component of solar radiation decreased as the building blocked the sky dome. Despite the reduced sky view, the southern snowpack could have slightly increased shortwave radiation under clear skies due to reflections between the wall and snow. Hence, on clear days the net allwave radiation would be enhanced to the south of the building, corresponding to 2 mm surface melt per day, and would decrease to the north where direct beam solar radiation was absent (15 mm day\" 1 ). Clouds dampened this effect as most solar radiation was diffuse so that the open, southern and northern sites had similar radiative fluxes. The energy pattern was mirrored in runoff with the southern snow cover melting much faster than that at the open site and the northern snowpack melting more slowly.\n\nIn order to simulate some common effects on the urban energy budget, cloud fraction, snow albedo, building temperature and distance from the building (sky view) were altered in accordance with the literature values and personal experience. Clouds tend to decrease shortwave radiation at the same time as they increase longwave radiation. The net allwave radiation, and melt, was decreased at the fullsun open and southern sites, but was increased to the north. The net allwave radiation increased at all the sites with lowered albedo. The southern and open sites were more sensitive simply because they received more solar radiation. The energy available for melt as much as doubled at these sites and runoff began several days earlier. Warmer wall temperatures increased the longwave radiation received at both building related sites; direct sunlight striking and warming the southern wall meant that the enhancement would be greater to the south. Similarly, the influence of longwave radiation enhancement, both due to increased emissivity and warming, decreased with distance. Shortwave radiation increased as more of the sky dome became visible. With sufficient distance, the radiation budget and runoff on the southern side started to resemble that of the open site. This was not seen in the north as the shadow cast would be sufficient to block out the direct sunlight for at least 9-10 m.\n\nThe results obtained are similar to observations made at various urban locations in Sweden and Canada reported by Bengtsson & Westerstrôm (1992), Buttle & Xu (1988) and Xu & Buttle (1987). Taken in combination, changes to the energy balance caused by the urban environment can significantly alter the spatial distribution of melting snowpacks, over and beyond the disparity caused by the individual changes simulated here. À pattern emerges with open sites and sites located to the south of buildings having a greater melt potential than northern sites.\n\nRésumé Bien que les processus soient identiques, les conditions de la fonte des neiges en milieu urbain sont différentes de celles des zones rurales. Pour certains sites, la fonte est accélérée en raison d'une énergie radiative plus importante, alors que pour d'autres sites elle est ralentie à cause de l'ombre qui cause une diminution de l'exposition au rayonnement. Les modifications du bilan radiatif et des processus du manteau neigeux ont été étudiées. On a élaboré et évalué un modèle physique du manteau neigeux à partir de données obtenues sur une parcelle bitumée en Suède. Le ruissellement de surface simulé se corrèle bien au ruissellement mesuré. Le schéma du rayonnement en milieu urbain simule bien le bilan radiatif, courtes et grandes ondes, mesuré. Des séries d'analyses de sensibilité ont été réalisées en perturbant le schéma initial afin de représenter trois types de sites urbains; sol nu, exposition au sud (ensoleillée) et au nord (ombragée) d'un hypothétique bâtiment. La fraction nuageuse, l'albédo, la température des murs et la fraction de ciel dégagé sur le site ont été modifiés afin de reproduire les conditions urbaines courantes. Même sans l'intégration de ces perturbations, les flux radiatifs des façades ombragées et ensoleillées du bâtiment sont différents (allant de +15 à -35 W m\" 2 ). La fonte de la neige est donc favorisée au sud et entravée au nord du bâtiment. Les perturbations ne font qu'augmenter cette disparité."
