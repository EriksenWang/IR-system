    "abstract": "Root-hair initiation in\nArabidopsis thaliana provides a model for studying cell polarity and its role in plant morphogenesis. Root hairs normally emerge at the apical end of root epidermal cells, implying that these cells are polarized. We have identified a mutant, rhd6, that displays three defects: (a) a reduction in the number of root hairs, (b) an overall basal shift in the site of roothair emergence, and (c) a relatively high frequency of epidermal cells with multiple root hairs. These defects implicate the RHD6 gene in root-hair initiation and indicate that RHD6 is normally associated with the establishment of, or response to, root epidermal cell polarity. Similar alterations in the site of root-hair emergence, although less extreme, were also discovered in roots of the auxin-, ethylene-, abscisic acid-resistant mutant axr2 and the ethylene-resistant mutant etrl. All three rhd6 mutant phenotypes were rescued when either auxin (indoleacetic acid) or an ethylene precursor (1 -aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) was included in the growth medium. The rhd6 root phenotypes could be phenocopied by treating wild-type seedlings with an inhibitor of the ethylene pathway (aminoethoxyvinylglycine). These results indicate that RHD6 is normally involved in directing the selection or assembly of the root-hair initiation site through a process involving auxin and ethylene.",
    "full_text": "Polarity is a fundamental property of developing organisms and plays a major role in influencing morphogenesis (Schnepf, 1986;Sachs, 1991). The molecular and genetic control of cell polarity is understood best in the fission yeast during budding (Drubin, 1991). Saccharomyces cerevisiae grow asymmetrically and bud at specific locations within the cell. Molecular genetic studies have defined genes that affect each of the four processes involved in bud formation: polarity establishment, bud site assembly, cytoskeletal assembly, and polarized cell growth (Drubin, 1991).\n\nThe fucoid algae, because of their developmental simplicity, have been used to study fundamental aspects of cell polarity in the plant kingdom (Kropf, 1992;Goodner and Quatrano, 1993). The fucoid zygote becomes polarized upon perceiving a wide array of environmental gradients such as light, electric current, heat, and ions. One proposed mechanism is that environmental gradients result in the asymmetric distribution of ion channels within the zygote membrane, creating an internal ion gradient that serves to initiate polar- ization of the zygote (Kropf, 1992;Goodner and Quatrano, 1993).\n\nIn higher plants, relatively little is known about the establishment of polarity and its effect on morphogenesis. Some notable exceptions are developmental processes that are affected by the polarized transport of auxin, including the determination of the polarized vascular tissue and the regeneration of tissue with proper polarity in the absence of environmental cues (Sachs, 1984(Sachs, , 1991)). Although these processes are known to be affected by auxin, the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of polarity and morphogenesis have not been determined.\n\nWe are using root-hair formation in Arabidopsis thaliana as a model to study cell polarity and morphogenesis in plants. Root hairs are long, tubular extensions of root epidermal cells. The initiation of a root hair requires that a new site of cell expansion be established within the epidermal cell. In Arabidopsis, root hairs emerge from the apical end of epidermal cells (the end closest to the root meristem; Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990), implying that these cells are polarized. The overall process of root-hair initiation is thought to involve the establishment of polarity within the epidermal cell, the selection of the initiation site, and the directed transport of secretory Golgi vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes and cell wall components to the initiation site (Sievers and Schnepf, 1981;Schnepf, 1986).\n\nIn this report, we describe the identification and characterization of the rhd6 (root hair defective) mutant, which defines a locus involved in root-hair initiation. Roots homozygous for the rhd6 allele possess fewer root hairs than wild-type plants, exhibit a significant basal shift in the site of root-hair emergence, and possess many cells with multiple root hairs. Similar phenotypes were discovered in the auxin-, ethylene-, ABA-resistant mutant axr2 and the ethylene-resistant mutant etrl, and the rhd6 mutant phenotype was rescued when either auxin or an ethylene precursor was included in the growth media. The rhd6 mutant phenotype was completely phenocopied when wild-type roots were treated with an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis (AVG). We conclude that RHD6 affects root-hair initiation through a process involving auxin and ethylene and, therefore, should be useful to study the role of cell polarity in morphogenesis.\n\nThe rhd6 mutant was isolated from a pool of T-DNA insertional mutants (Feldmann and Marks, 1987) in the ecotype WS. A homozygous mutant line was obtained that had segregated 3: 1 kanamycin resistant:kanamycin sensitive and 1:3 mutant:wild-type phenotype in the F2 generation following a cross with the Columbia wild type. The ethylene-and auxin-resistant strains were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH). The stock numbers are as follows: etrl, 237; etol, 3072; einl, 3070; ein2, 3071; auxl, 3074; axrl, 3075; uxr2, 3077. The lines expressing the cDNA from the maize R locus were obtained from A. Lloyd and R. Davis (Stanford IJniversity, Stanford, CA) and were previously described (Lloyd et al., 1992).\n\nFor growth of plants in Petri plates, seeds were surface sterilized, placed on the surface of A.T. agarose medium (1% SUC, 0.6% agarose, and mineral nutrients [Estelle and Somerville, 1987]), chilled 1 to 2 d at 4OC, and incubated at 20 to 22OC in a vertical orientation as previously described (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990). Root-hair phenotypes were scored after 5 d of growth under these conditions unless otherwise noted. The growth of Arabidopsis plants in soil has been described (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990). A microgravity environment was mimicked by rotating germinating and growing seedlings perpendicularly to the direction of gravity at 1.2 rpm. Under these conditions, wild-type seedling roots grew randomly along the surface of the Petri dishes.\n\nA.T. agarose media containing IAA or 2,4-D (Sigma) were prepared by diluting a 1 x M stock solution, made in 1% ethanol, into A.T. agarose prior to autoclaving. A.T. agarose medium containing ACC (Sigma) was made by diluting a 0.5 M ACC solution, made in water, into cooled, autoclaved A.T. agarose. Similarly, A.T. agarose media containing GAB (Sigma), kinetin (Sigma), NPA (Uniroyal Chemical, Navgatuck, CT), or AVG (MAAG Agrochemicals, Ver0 Beach, FL) were made from a 3 0 -m ~ GA, solution made in 25% ethanol, from a 1 x M kinetin stock made in 1% ethanol, from a 0.1 M NPA stock made in water, or from a 0.1 M AVG stock made in water, respectively.\n\nThe rhd6 mutant was crossed to the mapping strain WlOO (Koornneef et al., 1987), and the FI progeny were allowed to self-pollinate. The F2 progeny were scored for the various mutant phenotypes, and a linkage to the a p l locus was noted.\n\nF3 seeds from FZ plants that were homozygous or heterozygous for rhd6 were grown and scored for the up1 phenotype. Five recombination events were detected out of 110 chromosomes (55 families) scored.\n\nFive-day-old seedlings were placed in molten 3% agarose made with APW (Schiefelbein et al., 1992). After solidifica-tion, sections were cut using a double-edged razor blade and were stained with a 1:20 dilution of 0.05% toluidine blue (made in 1 mM Mes, pH 6.0) in APW (pH 6.0). Environmental scanning EM was done as described by Schiefelbein et al. (1993).\n\nRoot hairs were counted over a 2-mm section of root from 5-d-old seedlings grown on vertically oriented A.T. agarose medium using a dissecting microscope (Wild M4:!0 Makroskop'). To determine epidermal cell length, 5-d-old seedlings were placed in APW and observed under a Leitz Laborlux S microscope. The lengths of five mature, hair-bearing cells per root were determined. Not all cells scored from the rhd6 mutant possessed root hairs. Values from 10 roots, were used to determine the average cell length unless otherwise noted.\n\nBecause root-hair emergence from different <,ells within one root cannot be assumed to be independent evlznts, whole roots were classified as either apical, intermedia te, or basal using the following criteria. Five or more mature root hairs from epidermal cells at the apical end of a 5-d-clld seedling root (unless otherwise noted) were scored for their position within the epidermal cell. The sites of hair emergence were defined as follows: position O, root hair emerges from the apical-most end of the cell; position 1, root hair emerges just basal to the apical end, such that the lateral cell wall, apical to the root hair, is sloping; position 2, root hair emerges, such that the lateral cell wall, apical to the hair, is flat but less than one root-hair width in length; position 2, root hair emerges, such that the lateral wall, apical to the root hair, is greater than one root-hair width but less than two root-hair widths in length; position 4, root hair emerges, such that the lateral wall, apical to the root hair, is greater than two roothair widths in length.\n\nThe average position of the root hairs from cells on each root was then determined. If the average value was between O and 1, the root was classified as apical. If the average roothair position was between 1 and 2, the root was classified as intermediate. If the average hair position was 2 or greater, the root was classified as basal. For these observations seedlings were placed in APW and examined with a Leitz Laborlux S microscope. Statistical comparisons were carried out by the SAS/STAT computer program (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) using the Fisher's exact test.\n\nThe rhd6 mutant was identified by visually screening seedling roots from pools of seed generated by T-DNA insertional mutagenesis (Feldmann and Marks, 1987) for individuals with root-hair abnormalities. As shown in Figure 1 and Table I, rhd6 mutant seedlings grown on vertically oriented Petri plates with the standard growth medium (A.T. agarose, see \"Materials and Methods\") displayed a reduced number of root hairs. This phenotype was variable; the root-hair density ranged from 0 to 60% of the wild type. The average length of rhd6 root epidermal cells did not differ from the wild-type WS but was slightly greater than the wild-type Columbia (Table I). After normalizing for the cell length differences, we determined that rhd6 mutant roots produced approximately 15 to 17% of the wild-type number of root hairs (Table I). Except for defects in the root epidermis, no other morphological abnormalities were observed in the rhd6 mutant plants.\n\nTo examine the nature of the rhd6 mutation, rhd6 plants were crossed to wild-type (Columbia) plants. The progeny plants, heterozygous for the rhd6 mutation (rhd6/+), displayed normal root-hair characteristics. The F 2 plants segregated 462:137 wild type:mutant, indicating that the mutation is nuclear and recessive. The RHD6 locus was mapped to chromosome 1, approximately 5 centimorgans from the API locus, by analyzing F 2 and F 3 plants from a cross with the W100 mapping line (see \"Materials and Methods\"). The rhd6 mutation was able to complement the mutations in the rhdl, rhd2, rhd3, and rhd4 mutant lines (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990), as well as other root-hair morphology mutants (J.D. Masucci and J.W. Schiefelbein. unpublished results), indicating that the rhd6 line possesses the only known mutant allele of the RHD6 locus.\n\nScanning EM and light microscopy were used to examine the morphology of the rhd6 mutant roots and root hairs. As shown in Figure 2A, large portions of the root possessed epidermal cells that lacked root hairs and displayed no indication of root-hair initiation. In addition, no evidence for root-hair growth was detected along these hairless cells when\n\nTable I.

Fluorescent brightener 28 allows detection of areas of cell wall synthesis (Fowke et al., 1983;Hahne and Hoffmann, 1985;Galway and Hardham, 1986). Most of the root hairs that form in rhd6 mutant seedlings have normal morphology. However, in some instances various defects in root-hair formation were observed (Fig. 2, B-D). Occasionally, a single initiation site produced two root hairs (Fig. 2B). More often (60 of 469 scored hair-bearing cells, 13%), mutant epidermal cells possessed two or more independent hairs. These root hairs emerged from two adjacent sites (background Fig. 2C) or from distinctly separate sites (Fig. 2D). Epidermal cells possessing multiple hairs were not detected in either Columbia (597 hair-bearing cells scored) or WS (200 hair-bearing cells scored) wild-type roots. Another defect detected in rhdd was a general shift in the site of root-hair emergence toward the basal end of the cell. This difference was observed in epidermal cells containing multiple hairs (Fig. 2D) and single hairs (foreground, Fig. 2C). Neither changes in growing temperature (4 or 30°C rather than 22°C) nor growth in a microgravity environment (see \"Materials and Methods') had an effect on the rhd6 mutant phenotypes (data not shown). The above phenotypes show that the rhd6 mutation alters the ability of epidermal cells to initiate root-hair formation.\n\nThe cellular organization of rhd6 mutant roots was analyzed by examining hand-cut transverse sections. The rhd6 roots possessed 8 endodermal cells, 8 cortical cells, and an average of 18 epidermal cells (ranging from 16-22), which concur with the numbers reported for wild-type Arabidopsis roots (Dolan et al., 1993). These results indicate that the cellular organization of the mature root is not affected by the rhd6 mutation.\n\nIn Arabidopsis, only epidermal cells in specific files produce root hairs, whereas cells in other files remain hairless. The position of the cells with respect to the underlying cortex appears to determine what files produce hairs. The fate of the cells in the two types of files can be deduced prior to root-hair formation, because trichoblasts (future hair-bearing cells) exhibit a delay in cellular vacuolarion relative to atrichoblasts (Galway et al., 1994). To determine whether the rhd6 mutation affects epidermal cell fate, cell vacuolation was examined in the developing epidermis of rhd6 mutant seedlings. In the mutant roots, a delay in cell vacuolarion of trichoblasts was observed, although it did not persist as long as in wild-type roots (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the rhd6 mutation does not affect epidermal cell fate specification but alters rrichoblast differentiation at the later stage of root-hair initiation.\n\nIn wild-type Arabidopsis plants, root hairs emerge from the apical end of epidermal cells (that end nearest the root meristem) (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990). Analysis of rhd6 mutants showed that root hairs appeared to emerge more basally on the epidermal cells than in wild-type cells.\n\nTo quantify the shift in the site of root-hair emergence, five possible sites of root-hair emergence, apical to basal, were defined (Fig. 3), and individual roots were classified as either apical, intermediate, or basal, depending on the average site of root hairs on their epidermal cells (see \"Materials and Methods\"). The distribution of wild-type roots (Fig. 4A) indicates that wild-type root-hair initiation occurs near, but not immediately at, the apical end of the epidermal cells (between sites 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 3). Neither a microgravity environment nor changes in temperature caused a significant difference in the distribution of roots (data not shown).\n\nThe site of root-hair emergence in the rhd6 mutant was analyzed and compared to that of the wild type. The rhd6 line used was derived from a cross of the initial mutant (generated in the WS background) with Columbia. Because the distributions of WS and Columbia roots did not vary significantly (P > 0.36), Columbia was chosen as the wildtype control. In Figure 4B, root-hair cells were scored throughout the root rather than near the apical end of the root (as in Fig. 4A). This was necessary because rhd6 mutant roots produce a small number of root hairs. For the Columbia wild type, 14% of the roots were classified as apical, 86% were classified as intermediate, and none were classified as basal. For the rhd6 mutant, 4% of the roots were classified as apical, 21% were classified as intermediate, and 74% were classified as basal. The distribution of rhd6 mutant roots is significantly different from the wild type (P < 0.01). The more basal site of rhd6 root hairs is not likely to be due to greater cell expansion at the apical end of the cell after roothair initiation because (a) cells with root hairs in different sites (sites 1-4) were the same length and (b) initiating root hairs were observed in basal sites (sites 3 and 4) within the cell (data not shown). These results indicate that the rhd6 mutation alters the apical-basal positioning of root-hair emergence in epidermal cells.\n\nTo determine whether the site of root-hair emergence is epidermal cells score In the center column is the arbitrary score assigned to each of those sites. At right are photographs of trichoblasts showing root hairs emerging from each of the five sites.\n\nrelated to the age of the root or the distance of the epidermal cell from the shoot, root hairs from either the apical or basal end of roots from 5-d-old wild-type seedlings were scored.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4C, a significant difference (P < 0.01) in the root distribution was obtained when root hairs were scored at different ends of the root. In roots in which hair emergence was scored in epidermal cells close to the shoot, a large fraction was classified as apical. When root-hair emergence was scored in epidermal cells close to the root meristem, a large fraction of roots was classified as basal.\n\nThese results indicate that differentiating epidermal cells of younger (shorter) roots may experience a stronger polarity signal than cells of older roots. This is consistent with a shootderived gradient involved in establishing the site of root-hair emergence that is attenuated as the root lengthens and ages.\n\nAuxin is thought to affect polarity in plants, and the hormone ethylene has been linked to auxin action in some instances (Morgan and Gausman, 1966;Buchner and Pilet, 1983;Wood, 1985;Rengel and Kordan, 1987). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether auxin and/or ethylene affected the site of root-hair emergence. In the first set of experiments, roots from various auxin-and ethylene-resistant mutants were examined. Figure 5A shows that seedlings homozygous for the auxin-, ethylene-, ABA-insensitive mutant axr2 (Wilson et al., 1990) produced a basally shifted distribution of roots that was significantly different from the wild-type distribution (P < 0.01). Interestingly, axr2 mutants also exhibit a reduced number of root hairs (Wilson et al., 1990; Table 11), and cells with multiple root hairs were observed in 4 of 98 (4%) scored trichoblasts. As shown in Figure 5B, etrl (Bleecker et al., 1988) also displayed a significant shift in the distribution of roots toward the basal classification (P < 0.01). The distribution of roots from the ethylene-insensitive mutants r+zl or ein2 (Guzman and Ecker, 1990), the auxin-and ethylene-insensitive mutant auxl (Pickett et al., 1990), and the auxin-insensitive mutant axrl (Lincoln and Estelle, 1990) did not vary significantly from wild type (data not shown).\n\nTo examine the effects of excess ethylene on root-hair emergence, the etol mutant, which overproduces ethylene (Guzman and Ecker, 1990), was analyzed. The etol mutation may be expected to cause an apical shift in the site of roothair emergence because mutations causing an insensitivity to ethylene shift the site of hair emergence basally. As shown in Figure 5C, etol mutant seedlings did display a significant apical shift in root distribution compared to the wild-type Columbia (P < 0.01). Taken together, these data implicate auxin and ethylene in the selection of the root-hair initiation site.\n\nTo further investigate the role of auxin and ethylene in root-hair formation, the effects of an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, AVG (Zimmerman et al., 1977;Edwards et al., 1983;Geneve et al., 1989), and an inhibitor of auxin transport, NPA (Keitt and Baker, 1966;Beyer, 1972), on wild-type roots were tested. Growth of wild-type seedlings on medium containing AVG completely phenocopied the rhd6 mutant phenotype. As shown in Table I, M AVG led to a significant reduction in root-hair formation in wild-type roots. As shown in Figure 6A,  M AVG also caused a basal shift in the position of root hairs such that the distribution of wild-type roots grown on AVG did not vary significantly from the distribution of rhd6 mutant roots grown on A.T. agarose (P > 0.56). In addition, epidermal cells possessing multiple hairs were observed in 10% of the scored epidermal cells (19 of 181). Although AVG blocks ethylene biosynthesis, it does not affect the conversion of ACC to ethylene (Adams and Yang, 1979). None of the defects associated with growth on AVG were detected in seedlings grown on medium containing both M ACC (Table I, data not shown). The auxin transport inhibitor, NPA, however, had little effect on root hair formation.\n\nAs shown in Table I,   concentration of NPA was sufficient to perturb gravitropic growth. As shown in Figure 6B, growth on NPA did alter the distribution of roots classified with respect to root-hair emergence (P < 0.01), but the altered distribution was not clearly a basal shift. These results indicate that ethylene is required for normal root-hair production and probably acts in a process similar to the RHD6 gene product, but the polar transport of auxin may have little effect on root-hair formation.\n\nBecause the rhd6 mutant and the hormone-resistant mutants axr2, etol, and etrl alter the site of root-hair emergence and AVG can phenocopy the rhd6 mutant phenotype, it is possible that the rhd6 mutation impairs the cells' ability to respond to auxin and/or ethylene. To test this, rhd6 mutants were assayed for their response to the exogenously applied auxins IAA and 2,4-D and the ethylene precursor ACC (Adams and Yang, 1979). Seedlings were grown on A.T. agarose plates for 3 d and then transferred to A.T. agarose plates containing various concentrations of auxin or ACC. The increase in root length was measured after 2 d on the supplemented media and compared to seedlings transferred to nonsupplemented medium. As shown in Figure 7, IAA and ACC inhibited the growth of rhd6 mutant roots and Columbia wild-type roots to a similar extent. (2,4-D gave similar results but these are not shown.) The rhd6 mutants also exhibited normal sensitivity to ethylene (A. Bleecker, personal communication). Therefore, the rhd6 mutation has no discernible effect on the root's ability to perceive and respond to exogenously applied auxins, ACC, or ethylene.\n\nDuring the course of the hormone-response experiments described above, both auxin and ACC were found to rescue the rhd6 root-hair-density phenotype. As shown in Table I, rhd6 mutant plants grown on A.T. agarose supplemented with 1 X IO-' M IAA produced 51% of the relative number of root hairs as wild-type plants grown under the same conditions (compared to 18% of wild type when grown on unsupplemented A.T. agarose).

When ACC was supplemented at 5 X M, the relative number of root hairs from rhd6 mutant seedlings was 62% of the number from wild type grown under the same conditions. Increasing the ACC concentration to 5 X M increased the root-hair production in mutant seedlings to 78% of wild type. The root hairs produced in each of these experiments exhibited a normal morphology. These results imply that the application of auxin or ethylene can suppress the root-hair formation defects of rhd6.\n\nIt was possible that IAA and ACC suppressed the rhd6 phenotype by causing epidermal cells that would normally be hairless to produce root hairs (e.g. ectopic hair production). To examine this, transverse sections of seedling roots were analyzed. As shown in Table 111, hair-bearing cells from both mutant and wild-type roots grown on A.T. agarose supplemented with 3 X lo-' M IAA or 5 X M ACC were located in the appropriate positions (over radial cortical cell walls).  The increase in root length was measured 2 d after transfer to the supplemented media and compared to growth when transferred to unsupplemented medium. The root length inhibition equals the increase in root length measured on supplemented A.T. agarose divided by the increase in root length measured on A.T. agarose. Open boxes represrmt the Columbia wild type, black diamonds represent the rhd6 mutants, and the closed boxes represent the axr2 mutants. The data points are the averages of two trials with the end points of the error bars representing the value points for each trial. Approximately 10 seedlings were scored for each trial.\n\nIn addition, the hair-bearing cells on roots from thli ethylene overproducing mutant etol were present in normal positions. These results indicate that, at the concentrations used, auxin and ACC do not affect the normal positional controls goveming epidermal cell fate, but they do suppress the root-hair production defect caused by the rhd6 mutation.\n\nThe ability of IAA and ACC to rescue the other rhd6 phenotypes, abnormal sites of root-hair emergence and multiple initiation sites per cell, were examined. These phenotypes were assayed using concentrations of IAA and ACC that did not significantly reduce epidermal cell length. Both IAA and ACC led to an apical shift in the site of root-hair emergence in both wild-type and rhd6 mutant seedlings (Fig. 8). The apical shift caused by 1 X lo-' M IAA r'xdted in distributions on wild-type and mutant roots that did not differ significantly. In addition, multiple hairs were observed\n\na Trichoblasts observed over radial cortical cell walls.\n\nTrichoblasts observed over transverse cortical cell walls; the num-' Unsupplemented A.T. ber of roots examined is in parentheses. agarose.\n\nin only 4 of 154 (3%) trichoblasts in rhd6 mutant plants grown on 1 X lo-' M IAA. Figure 88 shows that 5 X lop7 M ACC is as effective (P > 0.33) as 1 X lo-* M IAA in altering the site of root-hair emergence in wild-type seedlings but had less of an effect on the rhd6 mutant. Only a small but significant (P = 0.014) apical shift in the distribution of rhd6 mutant roots was detected in the presence of 5 X lop7 M ACC compared to rhd6 seedlings grown on unsupplemented media (cf. Fig. 8B to Fig. 4B). The addition of ACC to the medium also reduced the number of rhd6 trichoblasts with multiple hairs from 13 to 6% (12 of 194 scored trichoblasts). The ability of auxin and ACC to rescue the various rhd6 mutant phenotypes is consistent with the hypothesis that RHD6 acts in an auxin-and ethylene-associated process to establish and/or respond to cell polarity during root-hair initiation.\n\nTo determine whether rhd6 is rescued specifically by IAA and ACC, rhd6 mutant seedlings were grown in the presence of other plant hormones. The presence of GA3 at concentrations up to 1.2 X M had no significant effect on roothair production in rhd6 mutant seedlings (Table IV). A small effect on root-hair production was observed with kinetin, but a 100-fold increase in kinetin concentration only increased the relative rhd6 root-hair number from 30% of wild type to 50% of wild type (Table IV). Because cytokinin can induce the production of ethylene (Lau and Yang, 1973) and can act synergistically with auxin to increase ethylene levels (Kondo et al., 1975;Yu et al., 1981), it is possible that the kinetininduced suppression of the rhd6 phenotype is indirect.\n\nPlants bearing other mutations that affect root-hair formation were grown in the presence of IAA and ACC to determine whether these hormones can rescue the defects in other root-hair mutants. The axr2 mutation, which confers resistance to ethylene, auxin, and ABA (Wilson et al., 1990), blocks root-hair formation. Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the maize R cDNA (Lloyd et al., 1992) also lack root hairs (Galway et al., 1994). When axr2 mutant seedlings or seedlings harboring the R-expressing transgene were grown on medium supplemented with either 3 x lo-' M IAA or 5 X M ACC, root-hair production was not enhanced (Table 11). Therefore, it appears that IAA and ACC specifically rescue the rhd6 phenotype and do not affect root-hair production in other mutants.\n\nThe initiation of root hairs is similar in many respects to budding of the yeast S. cerevisiae. In yeast, the bud site is determined, the components necessary for restricting growth are assembled at the bud site, cytoskeletal elements are organized at the bud site, and then polar growth is initiated.\n\nMutations affecting each process cause a different mutant phenotype. Mutations in genes affecting bud site determination, which involves the perception of and response to cell polarity, result in a normal number of buds but in random places (Chant and Herskowitz, 1991). Blocks in bud site assembly result in the lack of buds or misplaced buds (Sloat et al., 1981; Adams and Pringle, 1984; Adams et al., 1990). Mutations altering cytoskeletal components produce variable phenotypes resulting from delocalized growth, disrupted mi- totic spindles, or aberrant organelle transport. For example, mutations in the yeast actin and myosin genes, which are thought to be involved in organelle transport, lead to the Table IV.

Plants with mutations affecting the determination of the initiation site might be expected to have a normal number of root hairs that are randomly placed along the epidermal cells. Mutations affecting the assembly of initiation components might cause a reduced number of root hairs, and those root hairs that form might be misplaced. Mutations affecting cytoskeletal components may be expected to affect root-hair number and enlargement and, therefore, cause shortened or malformed root hairs.\n\nThe rhd6 mutant phenotype reported here most closely resembles that predicted for mutations affecting the assembly of initiation components. Roots of rhd6 plants produce a reduced number of root hairs, and those formed generally initiate at more basal sites than wild-type root hairs. In addition, mutant epidermal cells frequently initiate multiple hairs, an event that rarely occurs in wild type. Root hairs are not produced at random, however, indicating that cell polarity still influences rhd6 root-hair initiation. Also, the rhd6 mutation does not affect the morphogenesis of the root hair itself because initiated root hairs develop normally, and the rhd6 mutation does not alter the basic mechanism specifying cell fate in the root epidermis. Therefore, RHD6 is most likely required for the assembly of the cellular components at the root-hair initiation site in differentiating trichoblasts.\n\nOur results show that ethylene and auxin are involved in root-hair formation in wild-type Arabidopsis. First, axr2 and etrl mutant plants exhibit a basal shift in the site of root-hair emergence and etol mutant plants exhibit an apical shift in root-hair emergence. Second, the addition of either auxin or the ethylene precursor ACC to the growth medium rescues the rhd6 mutant phenotypes. Finally, wild-type seedlings grown on medium containing AVG, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, exhibit the same phenotypes as the rhd6 mutants grown on unsupplemented medium.\n\nIn previous studies, ethylene has been shown to promote root-hair formation in pea, faba bean, and lupine (Borgstrom, 1939, as referenced by Abeles et al., 1992), as well as in tulip, which normally lacks root hairs (De Munk and De Rooy, 1971). At the concentrations used in this study, ACC did not enhance root-hair formation in wild-type Arabidopis plants, although it did influence the site of root-hair initiaiion. Thus, ethylene may normally serve to regulate root-hair formation in many plant species. The phenocopy of the rhd6 mutant phenotype by AVG-treated wild-type seedlings is consistent with a role for ethylene in the assembly of the, root-hair initiation complex. Although the precise role of aurin in roothair initiation is not clear, auxin has been implice ted in the loosening of cell walls (Vanderhoef and Dute, L981), the altered expression of cell wall components (Nishitani and Masuda, 1983;Ray, 1985), and the polarization of tissues (Sachs, 1984(Sachs, , 1991)).\n\nThe plant hormones affect a variety of developmental processes and have been the subject of years 01 research. However, the mechanisms by which they act are still understood poorly. The apparent association among aurin, ethylene, and the newly described rhd6 mutation ind cates that the RHD6 gene product may be useful as a tool to probe the mechanism of hormone action. In addition, the rhdti mutation will be beneficial for the study of root epidermal cell differentiation at both the molecular and genetic levels. .4n important future goal will be to determine whether the RHD6 gene product affects the levels of auxin and/or ethylene, affects the ability of the epidermal cells to respond to auxin and/or ethylene, or acts in a pathway that is parallel to an auxin and/or ethylene pathway in the root epidermis.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.
