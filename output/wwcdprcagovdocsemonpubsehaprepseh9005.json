Monitoring pesticide loads in soil water was the primary objective of the described study. Tension lysimeters were used to extract soil water samples from plots treated with eight pesticides. Drainage waters from six post-application irrigations were evaluated for residues. Procedures for the construction, use and installation of the tension lysimeters are documented.\n\nResults indicate that soil water monitoring by tension lysimeters offers several advantages over whole soil extraction procedures.\n\nThese advantages include savings in labor costs, supplies, equipment and the potential for repetitive use of the lysimeters over several seasons. A cost analysis is presented for a monitoring scenario that compares soil sampling procedures.\n\nEstimates suggest that use of lysimeters may cut the costs of soil monitoring projects in half. From a qualitative view, soil sampling strategies emphasizing the collection of soil water are more representative of actual pesticide loadings associated with leaching processes and are less destructive to experimental plots than drilling rigs. Soil water samples are less prone to exhibit analytical anomalies such as matrix interference problems and pesticide recoveries are often better than those associated with standard soil core samples. Statistically derived functions can be developed that describe the average loads of pesticides migrating past a set point in the soil such as the root zone depth and eight foot limits defined in the PCPA.\n\nA comparison is made between the lysimeter study results and Studies using tension lysimeters should be pursued for monitoring projects involving the PCPA. Tension lysimeters will not be successful in a l l situations, i.e. cracking clay soils. However, they should be of great benefit in most other soils especially those with a high sand content which are most often associated with incidences of groundwater contamination in California particularly in the San Joaquin Valley and the Santa Ana Basin.\n\nList of Figures         Page Tension lysimeter and sample collection assembly.\n\nPesticide plot layout.\n\nMean distribution of bromide in soil profile. 19 Mean distribution of bromide in soil water.\n\n2 1\n\nMean distribution of atrazine in soil profile.\n\nMean distribution of carbofuran in soil profile.\n\nCorrelation of mean atrazine levels with sand content.\n\nCorrelation of mean carbofuran levels with sand content.\n\nMean concentrations of atrazine in soil water.  2 3 6 7 viii L i s t of Tables Table 1.

These areas are intensively cultivated to a wide-ranging spectrum of crops. Associated with these crops is an inseparable and diverse array of pests that is controlled through the use of pesticides to lessen their economic impact on agricultural productivity.\n\nSome of these pesticides have had complementary negative effects on the environment.\n\nIn California, 21 pesticides have been positively identified in ground water samples (Brown et al., 1986; Ames et al., 1987; Cardozo et al., 1 9 8 8 ) . Although the sources of these contaminants have not necessarily been established (legal agricultural use; point vs non-point sources, etc), these pesticides are composed mainly of soil applied herbicides and nematicides/insecticides. The Pesticide Contamination Prevention Act (PCPA) of 1 9 8 5 (Connelly,. '1985) has provided-criteria to ideritkfy -pesticides with a potential to pollute ground water and has mandated the monitoring of these pesticides contaminants in soil and ground water. Monitoring techniques employed by the Environmental Hazards Assessment Program (EHAP) have been limited to well water sampling and soil coring procedures which have been described in other in-house reports (Zalkin et al., 1984; Sava, 1 9 8 6 ) . Well water monitoring has been fruitful in establishing spatial boundaries on the geographic extent of localized contaminated areas. Undisturbed soil core sampling methods utilizing the MobileR drill rig have contributed to EHAP's sampling faculties enhancing the development of databases on pesticide contaminants and their distributions. These databases include the results of investigations conducted in areas of high use of specific pesticides, principally on active farms with well-documented histories of pesticide use (Duncan and Oshima, 1985; Marade and Segawa, 1988;Segawa et al., 1986;Troiano et al., 1987;Troiano and Segawa, 1987).\n\nThe incorporation of the PCPA in the Food and Agricultural Code has provided the impetus for increased sampling of soil and ground water. Given the large number of pesticides which are examined by the PCPA review process and the associated costs (manpower, laboratory fees, etc.), other procedures for screening pesticides for their potential as ground water contaminants need to be addressed. These procedures are intended to be complementary to field monitoring activities that include soil coring and well water monitoring. The first of these procedures involves the use of models to predict the potential migrations of compounds based on chemical and physical parameters inherent to a compound under investigation and on the characteristics of the media (soil) to which it is applied. A multitude of models exist and include PRZM (Carsel et al., 19841, Rao's (1985) Attenuation\n\nThe primary focus of this study is to evaluate an alternative approach to soil coring procedures for monitoring pesticide movement under field conditions. The study described emphasizes the monitoring and detection aspects of pesticides in the soil environment through the use of ceramic-tipped soil tension lysimeters. The major advantage for the use of tension lysimeters is that of monitoring field drainage waters, the principal agricultural component responsible for pesticide transport to ground water.\n\nWith the exception of the construction of the ceramic tips proper (clay mixtures, molding, firing, and testing), all facets of their assembly, installation, and their eventual linkage into a cohesive sampling system are discussed. A detailed description of the construction and installation of the tension lysimeters along with information on plot construction and irrigation is found in Appendix 1. The vacuum system which provided the necessary pressure drop relative to atmospheric conditions is also discussed therein. Information describing the costs involved in constructing the sampling system is included.\n\nA hypothetical monitoring project is developed in Appendix 2 to illustrate potential savings in labor, supplies and equipment that may be realized by the use of the techniques described.\n\nThe procedures used in this portion of the study attempted to follow as closely as possible those suggested by Helling and Dragun (1981). Their protocol has been excerpted from an Association of Official Analytical Chemist symposium targeting the needs of the EPA for guidelines for the registration of pesticides and other toxic substances. Deviations from their protocol were adopted principally to minimize laboratory costs for analyses or to utilize existing plots which were available at the start of this project.\n\nTension lysimeters were installed in 24 non-cropped basins (6.1 m\n\nx 4 . 3 m dimensions). The plots received 6 consecutive irrigations Irrigation Practices The frequency and amount of irrigation and rainfall water applied are critical factors that impact pesticide migration. These water inputs can be monitored closely in the field under experimental circumstances or they can be estimated from common meteorological records on rainfall and evapotranspiration. In the present study, 7.6 cm deep irrigations were applied to each basin at weekly intervals for 6 weeks (total water applied = 45.7 cm) . This 45.7 cm total was selected as an intermediate level of water to that delivered by rainfall or used in evapotranspiration, especially in the Central Valley and Santa Ana Basins (Anonymous, 1986). Weekly irrigation intervals were chosen because this time span would ensure complete drainage of the plots between irrigations and t o allow time for the processing of samples (splitting, labelling, etc.) . The actual soil water sampling start time was five hours after irrigation. This delay was based on soil survey information identifying the plots as falling under a Hanford Series soil mapping unit with an associated percolation rate of 5.1-15.2 cm per hour (Knecht, 1971). At the maximum rate of percolation the water front would be expected to arrive at the lysimeter depth (1.07 m) in 7 hours. Percolation rates were monitored with a neutron probe in 6 of the 24 plots. Results from two of the plots suggested that the percolation rates were somewhat faster than 15.2 cm per hour. Accordingly, the start time of sampling was set to 6 hours post-irrigation to ensure that all draining waters would be sampled. All plots were irrigated twice before the start of the experiment to ensure field capacity was reached within and between the plots. Irrigation of all plots was accomplished within a 1 1/2 hour time span. Two cubic meters (7.6 cm depth equivalent) of water was delivered to each plot at each irrigation event. Irrigation commenced between 7:OO and 7 : 3 0 DST in the morning with the water sampling start-up time of 1:OO to 1:30 PM DST. Sampling was conducted for a period of 48 hours measured from the 1:00 PM DST start time. Sampling jars were checked periodically during the day. The collection jars were isolated from the vacuum source by use of a clamp across the latex tubing that connected the collection jar to the PVC manifold. Pesticide Application Eight candidate pesticides were selected based on several factors including the half-lives of the compounds, chemical classification, formulation and available historical information of associations as groundwater contaminants. The compounds included alachlor, simazine, atrazine, oxamyl, carbofuran, aldicarb, diazinon and malathion. Additional information on these compounds is listed in Table 1. The 24 basins were divided into three blocks of eight plots per block (see plot diagram, Figure 2). Each pesticide was randomly assigned to one basin within each block (three replicate treatments per pesticide). The rates of application for all pesticides were 13.0 grams of active ingredient per basin (equivalent to 5 Kg a. i. per hectare) .\n\n'able 1.

A potassium bromide tracer was also applied to each plot at a rate of 33.5 kgs/hectare of bromide. The tracers were used for comparative purposes as references for the remaining pesticides.\n\nBasins assigned the atrazine treatment received single aliquots of the compound.\n\nWater miscible formulations were applied to the basins with a hand sprayer in 1.2 liters of water. The aldicarb, oxamyl and potassium bromide were applied in granular form with a hand cran spreader. All materials were applied using a serpentine technique across a plot followed by a similar procedure in a path perpendicular to the first. This was repeated until the loads were spent. All compounds were applied to the soil surface within\n\na 2 1/2 hour period terminating at dusk. The following morning the compounds were rototilled into the basins to an approximate 3 in. depth. The basin floors were leveled off with bow rakes and the remainder of the day was spent in reassembling the soil water sampling system as previously described and in reinstalling the individual plot water distribution systems. The first of six post-application irrigations was delivered the following morning. Soil water sampling started 5 hours after irrigation of the final plot. Clean two quart canning jars were mounted onto the sampler assembly (see Fig. 1). The assembled collection vessel was placed in a Styrofoam ice chest and packed in ice immediately before sampling start time. Ice condition was checked periodically over the next 48 hours and repacked as necessary. Sdmple collection was initiated by switching on a vacuum pump controlled by an electronic timer set to produce two equal interval (15 min. ) on-off cycles per hour. Samples collected during this sampling period which approached the capacity of the jars were cutoff from the sampling process by means of a pinch clamp across the latex tubing connecting the jars to the vacuum rdanifold. At the end of 48 hours all sample jars were retrieved, labelled and transported to EHAP's Field 8C facility on the Citrus Experiment Station and placed in a cold box (36-38 F) . Approximate sample volume data was estimated at the end of the experiment after retrieving unused liquid samples from the contract laboratory (see Appendix 3 , Table A4.4) . The samples were split when volumes were sufficient and transferred to one quart canning jars. Splitting of the sample involved filling a one quart jar to capacity which was earmarked for residue analysis. The remaining solution was also placed in a one quart jar and set aside for bromide analysis. Samples of less than one quart volume were used for pesticide analysis only. This procedure, was used for each of the six irrigation/sampling periods. Soil Sampling At the termination of the experiment soil sdmples were collected from each of the plots with Veihmeyer tubes to a depth of seven feet in one foot increments. A sampling site was selected within a two foot radius of each tension lysimeter position. Four equal depth sub-samples from each plot were combined in a one quart canning jar and labelled. All sample jars were covered with aluminum foil and sealed with a ring and lid. The samples were later packed in dry ice and shipped to the contract laboratory in Sacramento for pesticide analysis. All samples (163 soil and 143 soil water) were analyzed for atrazine content and the appropriate companion pesticide. Bromide ion analysis on soil and soil water samples was conducted in EHAP'S lab facilities in Riverside as was soil texture analysis and pH. Soil texture analysis followed established EHAP procedures. Measurement of pH followed a technique described by Chapman and Pratt (1961) that utilizes a 2.5:l water-soil suspension. An extract of this suspension recovered under vacuum through No. 2 Whatman filter paper was used for bromide analysis u s i n g a bromide ion probe (OrionR) . RESULTS Laboratory Analysis and Quality Control Residue levels of the various .pesticides in the soil and liquid samples are presented in Appendices 3 and 4, respectively. Table A3.1 depicts soil values of atrazine determined for each depth with A3.2 showing the accompanying pesticide values for each plot as labelled. Values are placed corresponding to actual locations as shown in the plot diagram (Figure 2 ) . Table A3.3 presents the bromide ion values determined for each of the 168 soil samples less a few missing values. Results of soil texture analysis are shown in Table A3.4. Tables A4.1, 2, and 3 of Appendix 4 display soil water sample values utilizing the order detailed above with the exception that concentrations found within each plot represent consecutive sampling periods (irrigations). Several quality control problems were noted in the analyses performed by the contract laboratory, especially with regard to the handling of the soil samples. The soil samples were not homogenized prior to the extraction of a sub-sample to be .used in residue analysis. Therefore, the degree to which the concentrations reported for each sample vary ma,y be a reflection of the improper processing of each sample. A single data point reported may represent an'y portion of the one foot depth increment sample and any one of the four sub-samples taken from an individual plot. This scenario produces the worst case instance and has a realistically high probability of occurrence since intact soil cores were discernable in sample jars retrieved from the contract laboratory. This potential effect on concentration variability may be somewhat dampened by the more uniform distribution of a pesticide after the six irrigations when the soil samples were collected. The contract laboratory reported significant matrix interference problems associated with the extraction procedures. This is most readily seen in soil and water concentrations shown for oxamyl (see Appendices, Tables A3.2 and A4.2) . Reporting limits which are closely allied to the minimum detection limits ranged from <5 to <ZOO parts per billion (ppb). The reporting limits were markedly lower for malathion, diazinon, and aldicarb in soil water when compared to their counterparts in soil. The levels were 2.5 times lower in water (2 ppb) than in soil ( 5 ppb) .\n\nRecoveries from spiked samples reveal that additional problems were experienced in the laboratory with regard to the analytical procedures used for extraction and detection. Atrazine recoveries based on two spiked samples ranged from 54 to 128 percent.\n\nRecovery of atrazine varied between duplicate spikes and with the companion pesticide extracted. The precision of concentrations based on recoveries was not calculated due to insufficient spike replication.\n\nInformation on mean recoveries was ambiguous with respect to the media represented. This is readily seen in the percent recoveries of carbofuran and aldicarb presented in\n\nTable 2. Recoveries from soil water were 60% and 135% respectively for carbofuran and 'able 2.

This is partially attributed to the lighter soil textures found at greater depths within the soil profile which affects water retention.\n\nThe distribution of bromide ion concentrations of the soil profile after the final irrigation was modelled using linear regression. The mean bromide concentrations of the 24 plots was regressed on the seven -1 foot depth increments. Loge transformations of the bromide means were also tested. Data used in the regressions and the results of fitting the models are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3 . The transformed bromide values were found to have higher coefficients of determination (r2 values) accounting for a greater proportion of the variability in the data. Individual plot concentrations of bromide ion were highly variable (see Table A 3 . 3 ) .\n\nAnalysis of the soil water collected using the ceramic samplers revealed a tendency for the mean bromide concentrations to increase with successive irrigations. These data and the resultant linear equation derived are shown in Table 4 and Figure In several instances bromide ion concentrations were still\n\nTable 3.

Mean distribution of bromide in soil water. increasing at the end of the experiment. A few possibilities exist which may help explain this observation. First, there is evidence in existing literature on tension lysimeters that ceramic tips can alter solution constituents and must be cleaned before concentrations can be measured with confidence (Creasy and Dreiss, 1987; Grover and Lamborn, 1978; Neary and Tomassini, 1 9 8 5 ) . These studies have generally investigated inorganic ions including nitrate, bromide, and chloride. Second, since the potassium bromide was rototilled into the soil in its granular form, its limited distribution in the surface soil may have restricted its ability to move with the water front. The early irrigations had tendencies to infiltrate into the soil at a faster rate than later irrigations. These higher infiltration rates may have precluded the water from saturating the surface layer of soil diminishing its efficiency as a solvent for the available bromide crystals and affecting soil transport processes. The final and most plausible explanation for the variability in the bromide concentrations is the variability in soil tortuosity within the plots. This phenomenon and its affects on convective dispersion has been addressed by Butters et al.\n\n( 1 9 8 9 ) .\n\nTheir results are similar to those presented here, supporting the hypothesis the mean bromide concentration in soil water samples had yet to be reached given the net amount of water applied.\n\nThe first explanation implying that the affinity of ceramic samplers for bromide adsorption may be responsible\n\nf o r the r e s u l t s o b s e r v e d i s n o t c o n s i d e r e d t o h a v e much b e a r i n g i n t h i s c a s e s i n c e t h e c o n c e n t r a t i o n s f o u n d i n t h e e x t r a c t e d s o i l w a t e r samples a t the f i r s t i r r i g a t i o n were s u b s t a n t i a l l y h i g h e r (mean = 5.6 + / -4 . 2 pprn b r o m i d e ) t h a n b r o m i d e l e v e l s i n i r r i g a t i o n w a t e r background samples taken at the beginning ( 1 . 6 1 ppm bromide) and a t t h e end (1.45 ppm bromide) of the e x p e r i m e n t .

Regression\n\nAnalysis was used to model the distribution of atrazine and carbofuran in the soil as was done previously with the bromide data.\n\nAnalysis of the atrazine data was similar to that of the bromide where the natural logarithm transformation of the atrazine data provided a better fit of the linear model. The carbofuran data contained \" 0 \" values which would require a constant value be added to all figures prior to transformation (log,). This procedure was not appropriate given the low number (7) of points used to fit the model and unnecessary because of the relatively high coefficient of determination ( 8 4 % ) achieved with the linear regression of the untransformed data. In an effort to test for correlations between atrazine and soil texture, the pesticide data (see Table 5 ) , log, transformed values for atrazine and untransformed for carbofuran, were regressed against the means in percent sand content for each depth shown in Table 3. The coefficients of determination (r2) for these regressions were markedly similar to those obtained in fitting the respective atrazine (log,) and carbofuran data to soil depth. Figures 5 thru 8 graphically describe the results obtained for depth and percent sand content to atrazine and carbofuran values.\n\nSoil concentrations of the remaining compounds were too scant to evaluate statistically. Malathion was peculiar in that residues in the soil were found only at the two greatest depths. However, these values were found to be completely related to occurrences Soil C a r b o f m Figure 6.

The distributions of the data proved to be non-normal as with the soil samples. The data as a whole appeared to be more reliable since the problem of matrix interferences was subdued in comparison with the soil samples.\n\nTable 6 presents the mean concentrations of the eight pesticides used in the study Over each of the six irrigation events. Tables A4.1 and A4.2 present the resultant data on atrazine and the other pesticides in water data accumulated during the course of this study. All of the pesticide compounds with the exception of malathion were detected in soil water. Diazinon was found in only 1 of 18 samples at a concentration of 0.2 ppb. This positive sample was collected at the first irrigation. Table 6 .

Because of the sparseness of the data, due partially to insufficient replication and analytical concerns, there is a general increase in the number (5) of no-contest plots where no serious evaluation can be made. Included in this category are those plots where no pesticide was detected at any level within the soil profile nor was it found to be in water samples. Of the remaining 19 plots, 13 succeeded in trapping the named pesticide in soil water. In the case of aldicarb the tension lysimeters cannot be considered as having failed since no parent compound was detected in the soil profile. Four additional plots had measurable levels in the upper strata but none below the tension lysimeter position. This leaves two plots which are definite failures and include the first malathion replicate and the third simazine replicate. This yields a failure rate of 10.5% (2 of 19 plots). The apparent success of the tension lysimeter in trapping the pesticides concerned in this study is evident. However, the question remains as to what the concentrations detected represent. The levels noted may be undervalued in consideration of the p o t e n t i a l f o r t h e ceramic cup t o a d s o r b some unknown q u a n t i t y o f p e s t i c i d e .

Atrazine has a shorter half-life in the GWPOL default listings (64 days) than it had originally (71 days). These changes coupled with the SNV criteria are indicative of the processes under way in determining environmental fate constants for pesticides.\n\nThe GWPOL ranking using the SNV data has the closest association with the ranking developed empirically by monitoring of pesticides collected via the tension lysimeters (see Table 12).\n\nComparison of the ranks for each pesticide reveals that in only one instance, that of oxamyl, was the discrepancy between ranks greater than two units. Simazine is 6th in both lysimeter and GWPOL rankings when S N V criteria are used. The remaining 6 pesticides were divided into equal groups whose ranks were off by one or two units. Spearman's r values were calculated in a test of the rankings. There was a significant correlation detected between the lysimeter-and SNV-generated rankings (pC.05).\n\nThe GWPOL program results, measured in units of time (years to ground water), are depicted in Table 13 for each of the three contamination potential scenarios described earlier.\n\nIt is evident that the user assigned scenario values are closely related to the high potential scenario results. This is not surprising since the high potential scenario presents the classic case of a sandy soil with low levels of organic carbon, etc. all\n\nTable 11.

The Hanford series soil that composed the experimental plots are wide-spread throughout the Central Valley and the Santa Ana River Basin,\n\nThe utility of bromide and atrazine as tracers for other chemicals may be of significance for future monitoring studies.\n\nThe information obtained on these two chemicals provides a tool for comparing additional compounds. The linear equations describing the concentrations of each chemical in water samples over the course of the experiment are virtually identical.\n\nConsideration should be given the fact that bromide is reported in units of parts per million (ppm) not parts per billion (ppb) .\n\nDespite the 1000-fold difference in observed levels and a greater than 6-fold difference in application rates for bromide over The soil water sampling system as described was efficient in extracting liquids from soil in samples of sufficient volume to meet normal analytical needs. There are two potential drawbacks to using a system such as that described here in a monitoring program, though these were not critical to this investigation.\n\nFirst, there is a tendency for the four lysimeters in each plot to extract water from the soil at variable rates. This can result from improper installation, manifold leaks, differences in soil The samplers were built from basic materials to determine the sources of costs incurred in their construction and to identify problematic steps associated with their assembly and eventual use. Current price lists from SoilMoisture, Inc. quote lysimeters comparable to those used in this study at $26.20. This does not include t h e costs of replacing the polyethylene tubing with that of Teflon' which is necessary in the collection of low concentration samples of organic compounds. Though ceramic tips can be made from \"scratch\" from cookbook methods, it is more expedient and efficient to purchase them ready-made. Sources for raw materials (clays) are not dependable. In addition, ceramic tips available through commercial vendors are tested to conform to industry standards.\n\nThe plastic components that along with the ceramic tip constitute the body of the sampler were cut on a lathe. The tube portion was cut from nominal 1-11'2 in. Schedule 40 PVC pipe in 6-1/2 in.\n\nsections. Components of the tension lysimeter and dimensional specifications are shown in Figure 1 in the main body of text. A 3 / 8 in. hole was drilled in the center of the end cap and tapped to accommodate the 1/8 in. x 1/8 in. compression by male pipe thread (MPT) brass connector. The brass connector was bored out from the compression fitting end with a 3 millimeter drill, permitting a 1/8 in. diameter length of TeflonR tubing to be threaded through the opening and past the male pipe thread section of the fitting. The brass compression sleeve was discarded because it had the tendency of crimping and/or cutting the TeflonR tubing. It was replaced with an approximate 3 / 3 2 in.\n\nlength of vinyl plastic tubing (1/8 in. I . D . x 1/16 in. wall thickness). This system provided an adequate sealing mechanism for this joint. Plastic fittings and sleeves (ferrules) are available as a substitute but their costs have not been verified.\n\nThe end cap was cemented to the PVC tube with PVC glue. The ceramic tip was then attached using the recommended epoxy glue. The vacuum manifold consisted of 2 -3/4 in. PVC lines running down the east-west berms alongside the main irrigation lines.\n\nThese main manifold lines were tapped three times so that two adjacent east-west oriented plots on either side of a main line would be supplied with a vacuum source. The vacuum lines on the end of a run were terminated in a tee-shaped configuration and capped. The caps had been drilled and tapped to accept the male end of a brass connector.\n\n1/2 in. O.D. x 1/8 in. wall thickness amber latex tubing was placed over the compression end of the brass connector on the terminal vacuum supply lines. The opposing end of the latex tubing was connected to the sampling jar.\n\nClamping of the latex tubing at this point was not necessary. A pinch clamp was tied to the tubing and was used as a shutoff valve during sampling periods when a jar was filled with soil water preventing its backing up into the lysimeters or into the manifold lines. Each end of the main lines of the vacuum manifold was fitted with a tensiometer (vacuum) gauge and a needle valve, allowing for the monitoring and adjustment of the vacuum in the l i n e s w h i c h was m a i n t a i n e d a t b e t w e e n 400-500 KPa (304-380 mm Hg).

COST STUDY A comparative cost study was conducted of the tension lysimeter system used in this study to the more commonly used soil coring procedures that the CDFA is presently using. The two methods are not directly comparable since different media or a combination of physical states are involved, i.e. whole soil vs soil liquid fraction. However, it is important to weigh the costs of the different methods because of resource constraints that may occur in the future affecting monitoring efforts. Table A2.1 presents a budget sheet of the monies expended in the development of the study site and the associated sampling system. In order to compare the two methods a fictitious scenario representing a monitoring project will be assumed. The scenario will contain several elements normally encountered in real monitoring projects. Scenario Pesticide X has been found and confirmed as a contaminant in several wells in an agricultural area in one of the State's southern counties. Pesticide X is used in various crops for the control of weeds. It is also used for roadside maintenance. There is no other known use in the vicinity. A monitoring project is to be developed to determine a) which use of the pesticide is most likely responsible for the contamination of ground water sources in the area and b) the seasonal effects of Pesticide X's use on the environment. A decision is made to conduct monitoring studies in two geographically separated areas of the State to include the Table A2.1.

Residue analysis costs are expected to run about $150 per sample. Laboratory . costs for the study will be between $68,040 and $113,400 including a 5% surcharge for quality control sample analysis. A minimum of 5 persons are required to run the drill rig and process the samples with the tasks including drilling, washing the split barrel sampler, preparing the stainless steel sleeves, filling out chains-of-custody, weighing samples, etc. If the assumption is made that each county can efficiently be sampled in a 3.5 day period including travel time then 175 person-days will be expended in the collection of the samples (3.5 days per county x 2 counties x 5 persons per trip x 5 trips). At the current Environmental Hazard Scientist, Range B, Step I pay rate of 107.49 day equivalent this would total $18,810.75 in labor costs.\n\nPer Diem charges per person for 3 full days at 82.00/day and 0.5 days claiming meals only will total 13,425.00 f o r the duration of the study.\n\nThe anticipated expenditures for this soil core study will be a minimum of $100,275.75 and could rise to $143,475.75 depending on the actual number of soil samples submitted for analyses (laboratory + salary + per diem totals). These costs do not include the accompanying transportation costs. Normally, two to three vehicles will be needed in the field in addition to the drill rig for the transport of augers, personnel and the delivery of samples. Also not figured into these costs is the depreciation on equipment values of approximately $100,000 for the drilling rig and vehicles.\n\nThe first step in using the tension lysimeter for sampling soil water is to certify that the lysimeter itself is not interfering with the integrity of the sample collected, i.e. the ceramic tip is not appreciably affecting pesticide concentrations. This can be verified in the laboratory by passing low concentrations of pesticide of interest dissolved in water through the ceramic and noting the differences in concentration and whether or not an equilibrium is established. This will normally require up to 15 samples. Provided no significant problem is noted with residue entrapment the lysimeter can then be incorporated in a monitoring scheme.\n\nTension lysimeter installation will require 3.5 person-days per county. This will include one day for implanting of the lysimeters in the soil at both sites within a county. The lysimeters will be installed at an 2.54 m (8 ft) depth which according to the PCPA is the minimum depth at which pesticide residues can be considered a potential threat to ground water.\n\nFive lysimeters will be placed within a selected field site at a cost of $26.00/lysimeter if purchased through a commercial vendor. Modifications to use TeflonR tubing lines would add $8.00 to the cost. The remaining sampling system would include $150.00 for a vacuum pump and a one hour timer clock ($28.00). Generators to provide the power are already on hand. The vacuum system will be transportable between the two counties so that only two such systems will be required at any one time. Miscellaneous charges of $50.00 to $200.00 per site may be applicable for plastic tubing and associated fittings for building the sampling manifold. The initial investment in materials and supplies required to set up the lysimeter monitoring stations will total $1086.00-$1236.00.\n\nThe sampling strategy when using tension lysimeters will need to coincide with irrigation events and appropriately scheduled. An artificial irrigation prior to Pesticide X's application may be necessary in some soils to obtain sufficient soil water to do a background study for existing levels of Pesticide X. These samples would best be acquired during the installation period accruing an additional 1.5 person-days labor to each county. It is estimated that the remaining samples could be collected at a labor use of 3.5 person days/county. This is based on the fact that the duties assigned this employee will involve attaching clean jars to the system, packing the jars in ice, and starting the generator and vacuum pump. The samples will be collected, labelled and shipped to the analytical laboratories after a 48 hour sampling period or when irrigation drainage has ceased. The labor requirements for the seasonal sampling will be Though soil distribution information is not an integral part of this monitoring scheme, it may yield data which may be of significance at some future date. During the installation of the tension lysimeters three soil samples will be collected from the displaced soil and will represent 1) the surface 30.5 cm (1 ft) of soil, 2) a composite sample of the next 2.13 m ( 7 ft) and 3) a sample of the 2.74 m ( 9 ft) increment. These increments would represent the region of expected high concentration of Pesticide X, an estimate of the potential availability of Pesticide X to be picked up by the tension lysimeter and finally a sample against which the lysimeter data can be contrasted to estimate the efficiency of the system. Soil samples would again be collected at the end of the study. The study would generate a total o f 120 soil samples ( 2 sampling periods x 3 soil samples x 5 lysimeters\n\nx 2 sites per county x 2 counties).\n\nThe number of soil water samples generated by the study will be 100 (5 sampling periods including background x 5 lysimeters per site x 2 sites per county x 2 counties). The cost of the 220 samples (120 soil + 100 water) at $150.00/sample will be $34,650 including a 5% increment for Quality Control.\n\nThe grand total for completing the required monitoring will be $ 4 1 , 9 2 3 . 6 2 .\n\nThis will yield a minimum savings of $58,352.13 over the soil core process, yielding a minimum savings of more than 5 8 % over the common soil core process. It should also be noted the lysimeter scenario includes soil sampling which may not be critical for this study and actually comprise over half of the samples collected.\n\nThe scenario presented is one not atypical of those common to CDFA. The costs above do not include costs for equipment, its maintenance and depreciation. Soil coring devices for the installation of the lysimeters can cost anywhere from $100.00\n\n(veihmeyer tubes) to ca. $20,000 .OO (Giddings MachineR) . This is far less than the $60,000.00 plus needed to purchase drilling MALATH I ON <2 <2 <2 <2 <2 <2 <2 ALD I CARB <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 DIAZINON 1 6 <2 <2 <2 <2 <2 <2 OXAMYL 6 . 1 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 ALACHkOR <50 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 <5 * matrix interferences ATRAZINE OXAMYL D IAZ INON ALD ICARB 1 1.32 8.85 2.12 9.05 2 1.75 1.28 2.38 2.32 3 3.88 1.55 2.78 4 1.95 3.22 5.55 1.60 5 . 6 8 * 2.18 1.80 1.30 .78 6 .38 .45 .98 . 6 8 .58 1.40 7 1.08 .50 OXAMYL ALDICARB CARBOFURAN MALATHION 1 .65 5.68 .92 . 7 0 2 2.68 .70 .40 3.60 3 2.72 3.20 4.28 4 2.20 2.28 2.00 * 5 1.75 1.68 1.78 7 .30 .78 .72 .35 6 . 4 8 * 4.40 2.42 1.05 .82 DIAZINON . 4 8 .92 1.05 .82 .78 . 4 8 .50 SIMAZINE 3.20 1.57 .42 1.35 .30 .20 1.02* ATRAZINE 1 3 . 9 0 2.88 2.42 1 . 5 8 2.10 1.58 1 . 6 2 ALACHLOR 1.28 1.85 .70 .80* .10 3.05 .45 CARBOFURAN MALATHION ALDICARB DIAZINON I 1 C J C ) 1 K Q 2 3 4 5 ____ --~~ L . 3 L A .

The input variables to the GWPOL program consist of KOC, half-life, bulk density, organic carbon fraction, depth to ground water, depth of root zone, soil water content and annual drainage. Output from this program is presented in the form of three scenarios for a pesticide with known or assumed Koc and half-life values. Included are a low contamination scenario, a high leaching potential scenario and one in which the model user can specify the field conditions to be simulated.
