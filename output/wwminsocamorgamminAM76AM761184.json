    "abstract": "Transmission and analytical electron microscope (TEM/AEM) study of complex calcic amphibole assemblages in metagabbros from the Cheyenne belt, southeast Wyoming, has revealed the amphiboles to be pervasively exsolved on a very fine scale.\nElectron microprobe analyses indicate that the bulk composition of the amphiboles ranges from actinolite (AI,\", : 0.559) to magnesio-hornblende (Al,-: 2.587). AEM analyses of the exsolved phases show them to be actinolite with an average composition of IGorNao,r(Nao,rCa,r,FeoorMnoor)(Fe,rrMgrorAlo38Ti00r)[Alo38sir62]Orr(OH), and hornblende with an average composition of Ko ,oNao ru(Ca, ,rFeo ,uMno or)(Fe, oMg, ,Alo ru-Ti'05) [Al,48Si6rr]Orr(OH)r. The tschermakite exchange, 16l,4,l,14lAl * (Mg,Fe),Si, predominates during the exsolution process, accompanied by minor edenite exchange, \\ae,tal[] e tr,Si. The hornblendes are always significantly richer in Fe and have a higher A-site occupancy than the actinolites.\nThe exsolution microstructure occurs as a pervasive fine-scale tweed texture with lamellae typically on the order of 5-I 5 nm thick. The coarsest lamellae occur in compositional zones representing the middle of the actinolite-hornblende solvus, whereas increasingly finer textures are observed on both limbs. High-resolution TEM images indicate that the microstructure is coherent with diffuse lamellar interfaces. The lamellae occur in two symmetrical orientations, nearly parallel to (132) and (\n132\n). Since the unit-cell dimensions of the exsolved phases are so similar, these orientations are somewhat variable. The orientation of this microstructure differs significantly from more common lamellar orienlations (\"100\" and \"101\") in exsolved monoclinic amphiboles. Optimal phase boundary calculations using EPLAG successfully predict the observed orientation for selected combinations of unstrained actinolite-hornblende lattice parameters. More importantly, they show that optimal phase boundaries may occur over a wide range of orientations depending upon actual differences in the two lattices, which are sensitive functions of composition and perhaps pressure and temperature.\nSelected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns ofcoarse tweed areas have revealed small satellite spots around the main Bragg reflections, indicating that the microstructure is relatively periodic, with measured periodicities ranging from 25 to 35 nm. The small satellite spots around single reciprocal lattice points, pervasive tweed texture, diffuse lamellar interfaces, and small size of the exsolution lamellae are consistent with a spinodal decomposition mechanism.",
    "full_text": ". Other studies have argued against the gap based on the common observation of irregular, patchy intergrowths and overgrowth textures, as well as continuous compositional gradients with changing metamorphic grade in some coexisting actinolite-hornblende assemblages (e.g., Ernst, 1972;Graham, 1974;Grapes, 1975;Sampson and FawcetL, 1977). Grapes and Graham (1978) addressed the fundamental question of whether the complex range of observed actinolite-hornblende intergrowths truly represents equilibrium crystallization and therefore a miscibility gap. They demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the coexisting amphiboles were most likely the result of disequilibrium processes and kinetically hindered crystallization accompanying changing metamorphic conditions rather than a miscibility gap. They further stressed the important effects of other mineral phases on the amphibole compositions. Clearly, the demonstration of true immiscibility between coexisting actinolite-hornblende remains problematic. Robinson et al. (1982) state that \"the presence ofone set of amphibole lamellae in another is one of the surest and soundest pieces of evidence for a crystal-chemically controlled miscibility gap and coexisting amphiboles.\" Unfortunately, unequivocal evidence of exsolution between actinolite and hornblende has yet to be characterized. Cooper and Lovering (1970) reported exsolution lamellae in calcic amphiboles from the Haast River schists that later turned out to be twin lamellae (Cooper, 1972). Klein (1969) reported \"100\" and \"T01\" exsolution lamellae in hornblendes coexisting with actinolite in rocks from Madagascar; he suggested that the lamellae might be actinolite, although they were not analyzed.\n\nExperimental studies of calcic amphibole solid solutions have yielded contradicting results with regard to the actinolite-hornblende miscibility gap. The studies by Oba (1980) andObaand Yagi (1987) on the tremolite-pargasite join and the actinolite-pargasite join, respectively, have shown well-defined solvi between tremolite and pargasite at I kbar and 800 \"C and actinolite and pargasite at I kbar and 680 'C, with the gap becoming narrower with increasing Fe content. Jenkins (1988) studied compositions along the tremolite-tschermakite join at 12 kbar, 850 'C and ar 3 kbar, 850 'C. His 12 kbar experiments indicated amphibole solid solutions between TsoTr,oo and TsroTrro, and the 3 kbar experiments showed a more restricted range of solid solution between TsoTr,oo and Ts,oTrno. However, none of the experimental results showed evidence of immiscibility between two amphiboles along this join at these P-Z conditions. The work of Moody et al. (1983) on the greenschist-amphibolite transition showed fairly smooth compositional changes (increasing Al content) in calcic amphiboles with increasing temperature (400-550 \"C) at 2 and 4 kbar. The high-temperature solution calorimetry study of fluor-amphiboles along the fluor-tremolitefluor-edenite join by Graham and Navrotsky (1986) also provided no evidence of immiscibility within the calcic amphibole series. Graham et al. (1989) have recently re-1 185 viewed some of the important uncertainties associated with experimental studies of amphiboles and the application of experimental results to natural systems.\n\nThe purpose ofthe present paper is to present detailed chemical and crystallographic characteization of exsolution involving actinolite and hornblende observed in complex calcic amphibole assemblages in metagabbros from the Cheyenne belt, southeast Wyoming. We believe that these results constitute a convincing argument for a miscibility gap within the calcic amphibole series.\n\nThe actinolite-hornblende exsolution texture is observed in amphiboles from a variably deformed amphibolite boudin in the Cheyenne belt, southeast Wyoming. The Cheyenne belt is a crustal-scale shear zone that extends across southeastern Wyoming from the Laramie Range in the east through the Medicine Bow Mountains to the Sierra Madre Range. The belt marks the boundary between the Archean Wyoming Province greenschist-facies basement and younger supracrustals (2300( -2000 Ma) Ma) to the north and middle-to upper-amphibolite facies Proterozoic terranes of the Colorado Province (1800 Ma) of the Front Range in the south (Duebendorfer and Houston, 1987). The Cheyenne belt is characteized by intense deformation, localized in shear zones along the margins of a series of lithotectonic blocks, which accompanied Proterozoic accretionary tectonics. Metamorphic conditions estimated from synkinematic porphyroblasts indicate that thrusting occurred at a minimum temperature of 47 5 t at a pressure of 3 kbar (Duebendorfer, 1988). Temperature estimates of approximately 500 oC were calculated for our specimens using amphibole-plagioclase exchange in variably deformed amphibolite (Nyman et al., 1989). Synkinematic granites and cross-cutting plutons indicate that Cheyenne belt deformation occurred at about 1750 Ma (Duebendorfer and Houston, 1987).\n\nThe amphibolite boudin is located within the East Bear Lake Block in the Medicine Bow Mountains (see Fig. 3 of Duebendorfer and Houston, 1987) and shows a welldeveloped strain transition from undeformed or weakly lineated amphibolite to intensely foliated and lineated, fine-grainedamphibolite. The actinolite-hornblende exsolution texture has been studied only in the least deformed amphibolite. This amphibolite has a subophitic texture with plagioclase interstitial to amphibole. Other minerals in the amphibolite include ilmenite, titanite, epidote, and qtla'rtz. In thin section, the plagioclase feldspar shows abundant evidence of crystal-plastic deformation, including grain size reduction, undulatory extinction, and the development of core-mantle structures. Amphibole occurs in large, 4to 6-mm clots that consist of a large, pale green, inclusion-rich core (which may represent a relict phenocryst), rimmed by blue-green, equant amphiboles and thin, undeformed amphibole needles (Fig. l). Amphibole porphyroclasts show evidence of mechanical twinning and undulatory extinction. The blue-green equant Fig. l. Plane polarized light micrograph of complex amphibole assemblage in the least deformed amphibolite boudin. The amphiboles occur as large, inclusion-filled porphyroclasts (l), equant subgains (2), and postkinematic needles (3). The inset shows a higher magnification backscattered electron image ofthe subgrains (boxed area) containing narrow \" 1 00\" and \"T0 1 \" cummingtonite lamellae (arrows). The porphyroclasts and subglains were found to contain pervasive actinolite-hornblende exsolution.\n\namphiboles have been interpreted as subgrains that formed during deformation and recrystallization of the amphibolite boudin, whereas the amphibole needles are postkinematic. Compositional profiles across the amphibole porphyroclasts, subgrains, and needles show an increase in tschermakitic and edenitic exchange components, which indicates that the texture formed during prograde conditions (Nyman et al., 1989).\n\nThe complex calcic amphibole assemblages were studied using transmission and analytical electron microscopy (TEM/AEM) and electron microprobe analysis (EMP). TEM samples were prepared by ion thinning selected areas ofpetrographic thin sections. Both the porphyroclasts and equant subgrains were examined in the TEM. Electron microscopy was performed at Johns Hopkins University with a Philips EM420 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 keV. A SuperTwin (ST) objective lens (spherical aberration coefficient C\": 1.2 mm, chromatic aberration coefficient C.: 1.2 mm) was used. For highresolution (HRTEM) imaging, the objective aperture diameter either matched the point resolution of the mi-croscope (0.30 nm) or was smaller in order to eliminate irrelevant high-frequency information from the images.\n\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) were obtained with an EDAX SiLi detector and processed with a Princeton Gamma-Tech model 4000 analyzer, as described by Livi and Veblen (1987, Appendix 2).\n\nQuantitative chemical analysis of amphibole was carried out on a Cameca SX-50 fully automated, four spectrometer electron microprobe at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Operating conditions were l5 kV and 20 nA. The following mineral standards were used for the microprobe analyses: NarO, SiOr, AlrOr: Amelia albite; KrO: Benson orthoclase; MgO: norberyite; MnO: pyrolusite; TiOr: rutile; CaO: wollastonite; FeO: Rockport fayalite. Compositional data were corrected using a ZAF program supplied by Cameca.\n\nThe only evidence of exsolution from optical and EMP examination of these samples was the common observation of narrow lamellae nearly parallel to (100) and ;l-\"'a 5l Tetrahedral sites M(1, 2, 3) M(4) A site Fer*/(Fe,+ + Mg) si AI > T site AI Ti Mg Fe2, > M(l, 2, 3) Ca Na Fe2* Mn 2 M(4) Na K > A site 7.865 0.135 8.000 0.043 0.000 3.498 1.459 5.000 0.081 0.142 1.615 0.162 2.000 0.221 0.013 0.234 0.468 7.896 0.104 8.000 0.025 0.003 3.387 1.584 4.999 0.092 0.023 1.691 0.194 2.000 0.095 0.000 0.095 o.492 7.839 0.161 8.000 0.034 0.000 3.245 1.721 5.000 0.090 0.043 1.655 0.2'12 2.000 0.156 0.015 0.171 0.510 7.861 0.139 8.000 0.013 0.015 3.521 1.451 5.000 0.143 0.071 1 .619 0.1 67 2.000 0.165 0.002 0.167 0.466 7.985 0.015 8.000 0.058 0.019 3.598 1.324 4.999 0.1 15 0.1 19 1.619 o.147 2.000 0.034 0.002 0.036 0.450 7.834 0.1 66 8.000 o.o21 0.000 3.436 1.543 5.000 0.080 0.084 1.659 0.1 78 2.001 0.216 0.013 0.229 0.482 Nofe-'Amphibole formula based on normalization to 23 O atoms and assumino all FeO.\n\n(l0l) in the amphibole subgrains (Fig. l). These lamellae appear identical to the commonly reported occurrences of cummingtonite exsolution lamellae in calcic amphiboles (e.g., Vernon, 1962;Robinson, 1963;Jaffe et al., 1968;Ross et al., 1968;Robinson et al., 1969;Ross et a1., 1969). AEM analyses (Table l) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of these lamellae indicate that they are indeed C2/m cummingtonite.\n\nWhen examined in the TEM, an exsolution microstructure of much finer scale was found to exist in these amphiboles. The microstructure occurs as a pervasive tweed structure (Fig. 2) and is typical of fine-scale exsolution microstructures found in many silicates (see below). The exsolution lamellae occur in two orientations and are very narrow, ranging from 5 to 15 nm in thickness in the relatively coarse tweed areas. Conventional amplitude-contrast (CTEM) and high-resolution (HRTEM) elecrron microscope images indicate that the interfaces between lamellae in the dense tweed areas are coherent and somewhat diffuse and curved (Figs. 2 and 3). The degree of coarseness of the tweed microstructure varies from grain to grain and in some cases within single grains, reflecting different bulk compositions and chemical zoning. In addition to differences in chemistry leading to variations in coarseness of the microstructure, coarsening of the tweed structure is also observed at dislocations, grain boundaries, and at the interfaces of the \"l00\" and \"T0l\" cummingtonite lamellae (Figs. 4 and 5). These observations suggest that the formation of the tweed structure postdates the cummingtonite exsolution and at least some of the deformation.\n\nSAED patterns ofthe coarse tweed areas indicate that a single reciprocal lattice with small satellite spots surrounds the main Bragg reflections (Fig. 6). This observation is consistent with spinodal decomposition (Champness and Lorimer, 1976), although it is not absolute proof that this was the exsolution mechanism. The lack of distinct splitting of the strong Bragg reflections attests to the similarity of unit-cell parameters for the two amphiboles. The presence of the satellite reflections indicates that the microstructure is reasonably periodic, with measured periodicities ranging from 25 to 35 nm. The tweed microstructure in these amphiboles is very similar to tweed exsolution structures observed in pyroxenes (e.g., Christie et al., 197 l;Champness and Lorimer, 197 l, 197 6;Nord et al., 1976), plagioclase feldspars (e.g., McConnell, 1974;Nord et al., 1974), and alkali feldspars (e.g., McConnell, 1969;Owen and McConnell, 1974), which are thought to have formed by spinodal decomposition. In very fine tweed areas (Fig. 2d), these distinct satellite spots degrade into streaks ofdiffuse intensity, suggesting a more poorly developed periodicity. This may reflect compositional modulations of lower amplitude accompanying the onset ofspinodal decomposition, as opposed to higher amplitude modulations in the coarsened areas.\n\nFor the following discussion, all crystallographic directions and planar orientations will be given in terms of the C2/m unit-cell setting for monoclinic amphiboles. The relationships between the C2/m unit-cell setting and the I2/m unit-cell setting are discussed by Whittaker and Zussman ( I 96 I ), Jaffe et al. ( I 968),and Thompson ( I 978).\n\nThe simplest way to determine the orientation of submicroscopic exsolution lamellae is to obtain a sample geometry that allows the lamellae to be viewed at an angle perpendicular to their short dimension, that is, edge on. The diffuse nature of lamellar interfaces in this microstructure makes recognition of the edge-on orientation rather difficult even in the coarse tweed areas. It is obvious from Figure 2, however, that the lamellae appear to be much closer to the proper orientation when viewed down ll0ll (Fig. 2a) as opposed to [010] (Fig. 2b). One area of anomalously coarse lamellae approaching 30-40 nm in thickness was found, which allowed a relatively accurate determination of the orientation (Fig. 7). Figure 7a illus- '.'vl hr, il trates a view down the [201] zone of this coarse area. Note that the two sets of lamellae have relatively sharp, straight interfaces, suggesting that they are oriented with their shortest dimensions nearly parallel to the plane of the photograph. Figure 7b shows the SAED pattern for the l20ll zone, which contains b* and Fl2l*. It is evident that the two sets of lamellae are symmetrically related by the mirror plane normal to b. Since any reciprocal lattice vector, rli,, is perpendicular to the planes, (hkD, wfih the same indices, the lamellar orientations may be found by identif ing the appropriate rli,'s in the SAED pattern. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 7. Note that the vectors [ 32]* and ll'I2l* arc nearly perpendicular to the two sets of lamellae, so the lamellae may be designated \"132\" and \"132.\" The true orientations of the lamellae are really parallel to planes with irrational indices, and because the unit cells of the actinolite and hornblende are so similar in dimensions, this orientation may be quite variable, depending upon small compositional differences.\n\nThese unusual orientations are significantly different from the typical \"100\" and \"101\" lamellae commonly observed in mutually exsolved calcic and ferromagnesian amphiboles (see Figs. 2c and 5 and references above).\n\nWork by Robinson etal. (1971Robinson etal. ( ,1977))has shown rhat the \" I 00\" and \" I 0 I \" phase boundaries are actually irrational and can be called \"optimal phase boundaries\" (terminology of Bollman and Nissen, 1968). It has been well established that the magrritude of the dimensional (or structural) misfit between two coherently intergrown crystal lattices is the dominant factor controlling the exact orientations of optimal phase boundaries (Cahn, 1968;Bollman and Nissen, 1968;Robinson et al., 1971Robinson et al., ,1977;;Willaime and Brown, 1974;Robin, 1974Robin, ,1977;;Fleet et al., 1980;Fleet, 1982). Robinson and coworkers further showed that lamellar orientations in clinoamphiboles and pyroxenes are usually constrained by the \"exact phase boundary theory,\" providing the b axial lengths of the two structures are nearly identical (Robinson et al.,197 l,197 7).\n\nSince the present lamellar orientations ditrer from \"100\" and \"l0l,\" it seems likely that they are not constrained I 190 Fig. 4.

A nonzone-axis orientation was used to enhance contrast. by this theory and that the magnitudes of the b axes of the actinolite and hornblende must be different. Similar cases exist for coexisting anthophyllite-gedrite, in which the differing b axial lengths result in exsolution lamellae nearly parallel to (010) and ( 120) planes (Robinson et al., 1969;Christie and Olsen, 1974;Gittos et al., 1976;Spear, 1980), and for coexisting glaucophane-cummingtonite, where lamellae ofcummingtonite grow in \"281\" and\"28l\" orientations (Smelik and Veblen, 1989, l99l).\n\nThe complex calcic amphibole assemblages in these rocks have been analyzed using electron microprobe (EMP) and analytical electron microscopy (AEM) techniques. Because the valence state of Fe cannot be determined from these techniques, amphibole compositions were recalculated using a 23 O atom basis, assuming all Fe is Fe'?*. Since optical examination of the calcic amphiboles showed them to be a blue-green color in some cases, there is probably considerable Fe3*. The electron microprobe analyses have therefore also been recalculated, normalized to both 15 cations excluding Na, K (l5eNK) and 13 cations excluding Ca, Na, and K (l3eCNK). Cations were assigned to the various crystallographic sites following the method of Robinson et al. (1982).\n\nSince the exsolution microstructure is so fine scale, microprobe analyses only provide bulk amphibole compo-SMELIK ET AL.: CALCIC AMPHIBOLE EXSOLUTION Fig. 5.

Representative EMP analyses of the amphiboles based on the all-Fe2* assumption are presented in Table 2. These analyses were taken along traverses across large, compositionally zoned porphyroclasts and associated equant subgrains. Note that most of these analyses show a stight excess of cations in the M4 site, further evidence of Fe3*. The l3eCNK recalculations of the analyses shown in Table 2 indicate calculated Fe3t contents ranging from 0.561 to 0.950, whereas the estimates for Fe3* for the l5eNK method range from 0.142 to 0.380.

In addition, where concentrations of elements are small (e.g., Na and K in these samples), the actual concentrations are subject to analytical errors because ofpoor counting statistics at low count rates. Also, they may be additionally enhanced or reduced as a result of minor errors in the background subtraction method applied to the raw spectra (Twist algorithm of Aden and Buseck, 1979). Analytical errors are compounded when analyzing very small precipitates because the overall count rates are much lower (see discussion of AEM procedures in Livi and Veblen, 1987, Appendix 2, for more information).\n\nThe transition from tremolite-actinolite to hornblende is dominated by three substitution mechanisms within the basic tremolite structure (neglecting Fe3*). These are the edenite substitution (Na,K)n,tor41 e flA,r4rSi, the tschermakite substitution [6lAl,t4lAl e tell\\r[g,ta1$i, and the Fe2* * Mg exchange (Robinson et al., 1982). Thompson (1982) has presented an algebraic method by which any mineral composition can be expressed vectorially in terms of a single additive component and a series of exchange components. Viewing composition space in this way allows a quantitative assessment of the exchange vectors for the two amphiboles. The bulk amphibole compositions given in Tables 2 and 5 have been recast in this manner using tremolite, CarMgrSi8Orr(OH)r, as the additive component and the following substitutions: FeMg ,, MnMg ,, NaAlCa ,Mg , (glaucophane), AlrMg_,Si-, (tschermakite), NaAlSi , (sodium edenite), TiAl,Ir4g,,Si , (titanium tschermakite), MgCa-, (cummingtonite), and KAISi r (potassium edenite). As expected, the only significant exchange components between these calcic amphiboles are the tschermakite exchange, edenite exchange, and the Fe-Mg exchange.\n\nThe bulk amphibole compositions are plotted in terms of the edenite and tschermakite substitutions in Figure 8. Note that there is considerable scatter in the AEM data, whereas the EMP data form a much tighter trend. Part of this scatter, especially the variation in edenite component, may result from the inherent problems in analyzing Na in the TEM, as discussed above. Despite this problem, a substantial range in bulk compositions is clearly present in these samples. All the calcic amphiboles have both edenite and tschermakite components. Note from Figure 8 that there is a bimodal distribution of bulk AEM analyses from the fine tweed areas (see, e.g., Fig. 2d), whereas the compositions of the more coarsely exsolved regions (see, e.g., Figs. 2a and 6) fall between them. This suggests that the range of bulk compositions spans the actinolitehornblende solvus, with fine-scale tweed exsolution occurring on the Al-rich and Al-poor limbs and the coarser textures developing from bulk compositions in the middle. This systematic textural variation probably occurs because the intermediate compositions intersect the solvus at higher temperatures and therefore coarsen more than the Al-rich and Al-poor compositions on the limbs 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 tschermakite substitulion Fig. 8.

These compositions cover much of the calcic amphibole series and span the actinolite-hornblende solvus. The scatter in the edenite component for the AEM analyses probably results from analytical errors for Na, as discussed in the text. End-members are tr : tremolite, ed : edenite, pa : pargasite, ts : tschermakite. of the solvus. The Thompson method also reveals that as bulk compositions change from actinolite to hornblende, there is a steady increase in FeMg-, [i.e., an increase in Fe2+ /(Fe2+ + Mg)]. This is consistent with previous reports ofcoexisting actinolite-hornblende (Robinson et al.,I 982,Fig.32,.\n\nComposition of actinolite and hornblende lamellae EDS analysis of the individual lamellae was hindered by several factors including the small size of the lamellae, the diffuse interfaces between the two amphiboles, and tilting of the exsolution lamellae with respect to the beam when orienting the specimen goniometer for optimum take-off angle toward the detector. Despite these problems, it was evident from the X-ray spectra that there is significant partitioning of Al between the two sets of lamellae in the tweed areas. Using a very fine probe (= 19-20 nm), analyses of individual lamellae in coarse tweed areas like those shown in Figure 2a were obtained. One set of lamellae showed Al ., ranging from I . 16 atoms per formula unit (pfu) to 1.49 atoms pfu, whereas the other set of lamellae has Al\", ranging from 1.64 atoms pfu to 2.06 atoms pfu. Although partitioning of Al is evident in the tweed areas, these analyses do not represent the compositions ofpure phases because ofcontributions to analyses from neighboring lamellae due to their small size and tilted orientations.\n\nSeveral anomalously coarse areas were found that contained large lamellae (30-40 nm thick) with relatively sharp interfaces (Figs. 7 and9). These areas were oriented so that tilting the specimen for analysis fortuitously brought at least one set of lamellae into a nearly edge-on orientation. Representative AEM analyses of these lamellae are SMELIK ET AL.: CALCIC AMPHIBOLE EXSOLUTION of the photo. The lamellae with dark contrast are hornblende, and the light lamellae are actinolite. The other set of lamellae is tilted to a high angle and appears as dark blotches in the image. (c) This image shows coarse actinolite lamellae growing at a subgrain boundary (arrow). These coarse lamellae probably formed by heterogeneous nucleation and growth. nm  presented in Tables 6 andT and plotted in Figure 10. In general, the actinolite lamellae have higher Si, lower Al, lower Fe2*/(Fe,* * Mg) ratio, and lower apparent A-site occupancy than the hornblende lamellae. In addition, Na appears to be redistributed with slightly more NaMa in the actinolite and more NaA in the hornblende. With regard to the A-site occupancies, it should be reemphasized that the low accuracy of AEM analyses (compared to EMP), especially for Na, leads to quite variable A-site contents for amphibole formulas. Furthermore, the chosen renormalization scheme maximizes the numbers ofcations pfu, and since it is likely that these amphiboles contain some Fe3*, the A-site contents shown may be overestimated. The apparent redistribution of Na is probably an artifact of the AEM process, the difference in Fe contents, and the recalculation scheme. The average Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) ratios for the exsolved phases are 0.349(52) for the actinolite and 0.588(92) for the hornblende. The miscibility gap defined by these compositional differences is shown graphically in Figure 10. Figure lOa is a plot of A1,., vs. Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) for 20 actinolite and 2l hornblende AEM analyses (including those in Tables 6 and 7). Figure l0b shows the gap in terms of calculated A-site occupancy vs. talAl. Al \", is plotted against I4rAl in Figure l0c. In each plot, the miscibility gap is well defined. The large circles connected by tie lines in Figure l0 show the positions of the average compositions of actinolite and hornblende lamellae determined by AEM. The average of the 20 best actinolite analyses is IQ orNao,r(Nao,rCa, r,Feo orMno o.)-(Fe, ,rMg, orAl0 38Tio o2)[Al0 38Si7 6r]0r, (OH)r. Averaging of the 2l best hornblende analyses yielded I(o ,oNa\" ru (Ca, ,, Feo ,uMno or)(Fe, oMg, ,Alo r.Ti. 05)[Alr 48Si6 5r]Or, (OH)r.\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, the calcic amphibole series can be described in terms of three primary substitution mechanisms: the edenite and tschermakite substitutions and the Fe -Mg exchange. By expressing the above compositions vectorially using the Thompson (1982) method, we can determine the magnitude of these substitutions resulting from the exsolution (Table 8). Table 8 shows the vector representation of the average lamellar compositions (shown above) and the bulk amphibole composition averaged from 24 AEM analyses ofthe coarse tweed areas; this represents the amphibole composition before the onset ofexsolution. From these results, it is clear that both the edenite and tschermakite substitutions operated during exsolution, with the tschermakite exchange being dominant. As mentioned above, the calculated A-site contents are to be regarded with caution for several reasons, and since the A-site contents are directly tied to the amount ofedenite exchange, the magnitude ofthis vector should also be accepted with caution. It seems likely that the edenite component may be overestimated. Note that the method assuming that all Fe is Fe2* results in some cummingtonite component in both the actinolite and hornblende, with small amounts of Fe2* assigned to M4.\n\nOrrrlr.q,l pHAsE BoUNDARv cALcuLATroNs It was shown earlier that the actinolite and hornblende exsolution lamellae are oriented parallel to irrational planes Tlele 8, Vector representatation of average calcic amphibole compositions (from AEM of individual lamellae)\n\nMineral Bulk Actino-Hornblende @arse lite lamellae tweed lamellae No. of analyses (24) (20) (21) Vector comoonents 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.970 1.634 2.546 0.026 0.026 0.027 o.o22 0.018 -0.060 0.516 0.195 0.819 0.368 0.124 0.425 0.035 0.017 0.0s3 0.086 0.109 0.182 0.052 0.025 0.134 0.420 0.150 0.559 0.551 0.212 0.872 Additive Exchange Exchange Glaucophane Tschermakite Sodium edenite Titanium tschermakite Cummingtonite Potassium edenite Total edenite Total tschermakite tremolite FeMg , MnMg , NaAlCa ,Mg , AlrMg-1Si r NaAlSi-, TiAl,Mg ,Si , MgCa-, KAtSi_1 SMELIK ET AL.: CALCIC AMPHIBOLE EXSOLUTION close to ( 132) and (lD). Furthermore, TEM images and SAED patterns suggest that the tweed exsolution microstructure may have formed by spinodal decomposition.\n\nDuring exsolution processes, the overall change in free energy accompanying precipitation of a second phase is generally expressed as AG.\", : AG\"oru-. + Ac.u.ru\"\" + AG\",..i\". For all coherent exsolution processes, the strain energy associated with the volume difference between the two phases, AG\"*\"-, contributes significantly to the activation energy barrier and, more importantly, controls the orientation of compositional modulations and nucleated exsolution lamellae (Cahn, 1961(Cahn, , 1962(Cahn, , 1968;;Willaime and Brown, 1974;Robin, 19741,Champness and Lorimer, 1976;Heet, 1982). Several studies have suggested that the minimization of the interfacial strain energy is the dominant factor controlling the orientation of coherent precipitates (Bollman and Nissen, 1968;Robinson et al., 197 l;Willaime and Brown, 1974;Robin, 1974, 1977Jaffe et al-,1975: Robinson etal.,1977;Fleet et al., 1980;Fleet, 1981Fleet, , 1982Fleet, , 1984Fleet, , 1986;;Fleet and Arima, 1985;Smelik and Veblen, 1991).\n\nTo test whether the observed lamellar orientations represent optimal phase boundaries along which AG\",.\",, is minimized, a series of three-dimensional optimal phase boundary calculations were performed for coherently interg.rown actinolite-hornblende. The calculations were done using the three-dimensional lattice-fitting program (EPLAG) of Fleet (1982Fleet ( , 1984)). This version of EPLAG calculates only the area misfit between normalized equivalent (hkD planes in the two related lattices and makes no quantitative estimate of elastic strain energy. The area strain was calculated at grid points on a hemisphere about the b axis using a grid interval of 5'. Each grid point corresponds to a stereographic pole ofan interatomic plane, (hkl), andis described in terms of the spherical coordinates D and E, where D is a counterclockwise rotation about b and E is a clockwise rotation about an axis normal to b (see Fleet, 1982, for details of the three-dimensional theory). The results are displayed on a stereographic projection down b, the equatorial plane being the a*-c* reciprocal lattice plane. It is assumed that the calculated orientation showing the minimum area strain between the two normalized equivalent planes corresponds to the minimum value of AG\",,,'\". This assumption is strictly true only for elastically isotropic structures; nonetheless, such lattice misfit calculations have successfully reproduced exsolution orientations in a number of silicate systems (see above references).\n\nThe EPLAG calculations make use of unstrained lattice parameters for the two phases. Since SAED patterns do not provide lattice parameter information ofthe necessary high accuracy and because lattice parameters determined from coherently exsolved areas are inevitably strained, there was no direct way to determine unstrained parameters. Lattice parameters for the calculations were therefore arrived at using a combination of published data and AEM data.\n\nThe most obvious way to find suitable unstrained lattice c* b Trz c'g otr a-e i-k i''Jt-u i-I b parameters calculated from the equations of Wenk (1971) (see unit cells a through h in Table 9). Actinolite-hornblende pairs are labeled. Note that the small differences in the D-axis magnitudes between most of these pairs lead to optimal phase boundaries in the [0 I 0] zone. Pair a-e plots about I 2' from the observed orientation. Filled circles are for model unit cells determined using the curve of Ernst (1968) and averaged literature values (unit cells i through I in Table 9). Actinolite-hornblende pairs are labeled.\n\nparameters is to use published unit-cell data for actinolite and hornblende having similar compositions to the actinolite and the homblende described here. A thorough search ofthe literature revealed no studies describing actinolite or hornblende having exactly the same compositions, but many gave compositions (with unit-cell information) that were reasonably close to our amphiboles. Another problem to consider, as indicated by Hawthorne (1983 and references therein), is that cation ordering in the calcic amphiboles is exceedingly complex, so even if matching compositions were found, different ordering schemes could result in different unit cells. Despite this, l3 actinolite unit cells [Zussman, 1955[Zussman, , 1959;;Ross et al., 1969 (2) ;Mitchell etal.,l97l1, Wenk, l97l (\\;Litvin et al.,I972a;Brady, 1974 (2); Cameron, 19751 and 32 hornblende unit cells [Raychaudhui,1964 (3); Binns, 1965 (a); Dodge et al., 1968 (2); Papike et al., 1969;Wenk, l97l (10); Litvin et al., 1972aLitvin et al., , 1972b (2) (2), 1973 (these unit-cell parameters were taken from the tabulation of Hawthorne, 1983, Appendix Bl, amphibole samples 45, 46,49); Hawthorne andGrundy, 1973;Bocchioetal., 1978 (3); Charles, 1980 (3); Hawthorne et al., 19801 were chosen from the literature. Of these 45 amphiboles, the data for the four actinolite and hornblende samples closest in composition to the present pair were used in the EPLAG calculations.\n\nParameters for these eight unit cells are given in Table 9. The results of the calculations are shown in Figure lla. Each amphibole is given a code number in Table 9 so that the various optimal phase boundary (OPB) orientations can be identified for each actinolite-hornblende pair considered. In Figure I la, the calculated poles are shown by filled circles and the poles for the observed orientations \"132\" and \"132\" are shown as diamonds. (Note that symmetrically related poles \"l32\" and*132\" plot in the lower hemisphere.) From Figure I la it is clear that there is a wide range of potential OPB orientations with three pairs (3-8, 4-5 , and 4-7) coming fairly close to the observed orientations.\n\nAs was discussed earlier, the deviation from the common \" I 00\" and \" l0 I \" orientations predicted by the exact phase boundary theory of Robinson et al. (197 | ,197 7) is thought to be caused by differences in the b axial lengths of the two amphiboles. In general, the unit-cell edge that differs the most between each pair exerts a strong influence on the OPB orientation. Since the D axis is about twice as long as 4 and about four times as long as c among clinoamphiboles, the relative difference in the D dimension must be significant relative to differences in the other cell dimensions before the predicted lamellar orientation is not a plane containing the D axis, i.e., a plane belonging\n\nI 198 Tmu 9.

Consider for example pair 3-6, which shows relative differences in unit-cell parameters equal to 0.010, -0.039, and -0.738o/o for a, b, and c, respectively. The large relative difference in the c dimension gives rise to an (001) OPB orientation. Likewise, pair 2-8 shows relative differences in unit cell parameters equal to 0.597, 0.896, and 0.0570/o for a, b, and c, respectively, and its OPB is just 5'from (010). The wide range of calculated OPB orientations for intergrown actinolite-hornblende suggests that since the unit-cell parameters of these two minerals are so similar, a range of lamellar orientations may be possible, depending on the exact compositions and unit-cell dimensions of the intergrown pair. Small changes in composition could result in large changes in orientation.\n\nIn addition to using published unit-cell parameters, actinolite and hornblende unit-cell parameters were determined in two other ways. Wenk (1971) correlated clinoamphibole lattice parameters with chemical composition using multivariable regression analysis and presented two equations and associated coefficients by which unitcell parameters can be calculated (Wenk,197 I,Eqs. I and 2 and Table 4,. Equation I uses the chemical variables Si, Fe3\", Fe2*, and Mg, whereas Equation 2 uses Si, Fe3*, Fe2*, and Ca. Using both equations, the average compositions given above, and renormalized ones using l3eCNK, four actinolite and four hornblende model unit cells were calculated (cells a-h in Table 9). Using the estimated values of Fe3* for the calculations resulted in very small differences in unit-cell parameters (less than 0. l5olo for the actinolites and less than 0.50/o for the hornblendes). The results from EPLAG on combinations of these cells are shown in Figure I lb (empty squares). Note that all the calculated OPB orientations except one (pair a-e) belong to the [010] zone (i.e., poles are 90'from b). The OPB for pair a-e plots about 12\" from the observed orientation. Several of the OPB orientations (e.g., c-f, cg, c-e) are very near that of( I 0 I ) and can also be calculated by using the exact phase boundary theory ofRobinson et al. (197 l, I 977). Only pair a-e shows enough relative difference in the magnitude of b for the pole of the OPB to be tilted up toward b.\n\nA third method of obtaining unit-cell parameters utilized dala of Colville and coworkers (1966); they investigated a series of synthetic amphibole compositions to assess the effects of various ionic substitutions on unitcell parameters of clinoamphiboles. Their results indicate that the magnitude of b is most sensitive to compositional changes and is primarily controlled by the occupancy of M4 and M2. They further show that in any given amphibole series with the contents of M4 remaining essentially constant, the magnitude of D is largely dependent on the occupancy of M2. The magnitudes of a and c are also affected but to a much lesser extent (Colville et al., 1966). For our purposes, we constructed a third set of model unit cells by estimating the magnitude of the b axes from the plot of Ernst (1968), summarizing Colville et al.'s work, showing calculated mean ionic radius ofcations occupying M2 vs. observed magnitude of D. For the present actinolite-hornblende pair, the M2 site occupancies were calculated by first assigning all the Al, Fe3t, and Tio* to M2 (Papike and Clark, 1968;Bancroft and Burns, 1969;and Hawthorne and Grundy, 1973;Hawthorne, 1981Hawthorne, , 1983)). Since many studies have indicated that Fe-Mg distribution among the Ml, M2, and M3 sites of calcic amphiboles is highly variable (see Hawthorne, 1981, Table 24;Hawthorne, 1983, Table 60), the sites were then filled with equal amounts ofFe2* and Mg. The mean ionic radius in M2 was then calculated using the ionic radii of Shannon and Prewitt (1969). Once this was calculated for both the 23-O atom, all-FeO, and l3eCNK compositions, we determined the magnitudes of b from Figure 3a of Ernst ( I 968). Since a, c, and B areless sensitive to compositional changes (Colville et al., 1966), we averaged these parameters from the l3 actinolite and 32 hornblende unit cells from the literature mentioned above. The final results of this procedure are shown in the lower part of Table 9 (cells i-l). The EPLAG results for combinations of these model unit-cell parameters are also shown in Figure I lb (filled circles). These OPB orientations, like pairs 2-5 and, 2-8 in Figure I la, reflect substantial differences in b of the actinolite and hornblende model unit cells. The magnitudes ofthese differences probably exceed the actual differences in the b axes magnitudes for the present actinolite-hornblende pair, since the observed orientation is about 30-40' further from (010).\n\nThe combined results from Figure I I lend further support to the idea that the unusual actinolite-hornblende lamellar orientations we observe in our samples are controlled by dimensional misfit between the actinolite and hornblende lattices. The difference in the magnitudes of b is of prime importance in producing an orientation that is not parallel to b, similar to the case of cummingtonite lamellae in glaucophane (Smelik and Veblen,l99l) but diferent from the \"100\" and \"T01\" orientations found in most exsolved clinoamphiboles (Robinson et al., 1982). An additional result suggested by these calculations that cannot be overemphasized is that because the unit cells of actinolite and hornblende are so similar, lamellar orientations may be quite different from sample to sample, or even within samples, and are probably functions of temperature and pressure as well as bulk amphibole composition. Consistent with Brady's (1974) observation, the potential variations in OPB orientations resulting from these factors may partially explain why irregular and patchy intergrowths of actinolite-hornblende are commonly observed (Klein, 1969;Brady, 1974;Choudhui, 1974;Tagtrr, 1977), rather than intergrowths with perfectly planar interfaces.\n\nThe TEM, HRTEM, and AEM results described above suggest at least two stages of exsolution in these complex calcic amphiboles. The first phase of exsolution involved I 199 the formation of \"100\" and \"101\" cummingtonite lamellae in some grains (Figs. 2c,5,and l2). Figure 12 shows a network of coarse cummingtonite lamellae in an actinolitic subgrain. Note that very fine tweed actinolitehornblende exsolution is also visible between these lamellae, with coarsening at the cummingtonite interfaces. Figure l2a shows the cummingtonite lamellae viewed down b in an edge-on orientation. Figure 12b shows the same area tilted significantly from b. In this orientation, dislocations associated with the tips of the \"100\" lamellae can be seen (arrows in Fig. l2b). This observation shows that the cummingtonite and host are not coherently intergrown at the lamellar tips and suggests that the cummingtonite may have formed by heterogeneous nucleation and growth. On the other hand, since HRTEM images show that the cummingtonite-calcic amphibole intergrowth is coherent everywhere else along their interfaces, homogeneous nucleation and growth cannot be ruled out, with dislocations forming during subsequent coarsening. Representative AEM analyses of the cummingtonite lamellae are presented in Table l. The Fe2*/(Fe2* + Mg) ratio ranges from 0.450 to 0.5 l0 with an average of0.478. These analyses contain signiflcantly more Mn (1.2-2.0 wto/o MnO) than the tweed areas, indicating partitioning of Mn into the cummingtonite during the first precipitation event.\n\nSome tirne after the nucleation and growth of the cummingtonite, exsolution of actinolite and hornblende began. The style of this precipitation event is markedly differ:ent from that of the cummingtonite event. The actinolite-hornblende exsolution forms a pervasive finescale tweed texture (Figs. 2, 3, and 6) with coherent compositional modulations in two symmetrical orientations, \"132\" and *132.\" SAED patterns indicate that the microstructure is rather periodic and produces satellite reflections around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. These observations are consistent with spinodal decomposition (Champness and Lorimer,1976). The wide variations in the degree of coarseness of the tweed texture combined with the range of bulk amphibole compositions (Tables 2 and 5) suggest that these calcic amphiboles span virtually the entire actinolite-hornblende solvus at these P-T-X conditions. It seems likely that bulk compositions of intermediate Al content (8.5 = AlrO, -10.5 wto/o) encountered the coherent spinodal first at some temperature below 450-500 \"C (peak metamorphic temperature estimates of Duebendorfer, 1988 andNyman et al., 1989). As cooling slowly progressed, these areas began to coarsen, while other areas with slightly different Al content (AlrO. = 8.5 and AlrO, > 10.5 wo/o) became sufficiently undercooled foi spinodal decomposition to begin.\n\nRecalling Figures 4 and 5, significant coarsening of the tweed texture was observed at dislocations and cummingtonite lamellar interfaces. These observations may represent selective heterogeneous nucleation and growth at these sites, or coarsening may have been expedited by the high strain energy or enhanced diffusion at these locations. From these textures and the fact that the subgrains Fig. 12. (a) Bright field TEM image viewed down the b axis in a subgrain showing a single \" 10 I \" and several \" 100\" cummingtonite lamellae. Between these large cummingtonite lamellae is pervasive fine-scale actinolite-hornblende exsolution. This texture has coarsened somewhat at cummingtonite lamellar interfaces. @) Same area in tilted orientation. The \"x\" marks identical locations in parts a and b. Note the dislocations at the tips of the \"100\" cummingtonite lamellae (arrows).\n\nas well as the porphyroclasts are exsolved, it is clear that the formation of the tweed microstructure postdates both the cummingtonite exsolution and some of the deformation in these minerals.\n\nAEM and EMP analyses indicate that these amphiboles are chemically heterogeneous and strongly zoned. Amphibole compositions varied widely not only from grain to grain but within individual grains as well. As noted previously, this zoning is also seen in terms of exsolution textures, as emphasized in Figure 13. This small area (about 3.5 pm'?) within a single grain shows a diverse range oftweed exsolution texture from very fine to fairly coarse. AEM shows that the texture varies with composition, with the very fine areas of Figure l3 having approximately 0.80 Al pfu and the coarser areas having about 1.45 Al pfu. It seems likely that these heterogeneous amphibole assem-blages do not represent equilibrium crystallization but formed instead during continuous prograde metamorphism, much like the coexisting calcic amphiboles of Graham (1974), Grapes (1975), and Grapes and Graham (1978). The results presented here suggest that this entire heterogeneous assemblage subsequently underwent exsolution during slow cooling from the peak metamorphic temperatures. It seems possible that other heterogeneous calcic amphibole assemblages, like those of Grapes and Graham, may also contain evidence of the actinolitehornblende miscibility gap at the TEM scale.\n\nThe results presented here represent the first solid evidence from exsolution for the existence ofan actinolitehornblende miscibility gap. Klein ( I 969) described \" 100\" and \"l0l\" exsolution lamellae in samples of hornblende coexisting with actinolite from Madagascar and suggested that they might be actinolite. Our results suggest that these lamellae are probably cummingtonite, and any true actinolite-hornblende exsolution would probably occur on a much finer scale, probably directly visible only with electron microscopy. In a study of deformation in calcic amphiboles, Biermann and Van Roermund (1983) noted the presence of a modulated microstructure similarto that described here but did not investigate it in any detail. Similar exsolution phenomena were also observed in calcic amphiboles from mylonites in Norway (Cumbest, personal communication, 1990). It seems possible that exso-Iution involving actinolite and hornblende may be far more common than previously thought but has gone unobserved because ofthe fine scale and perhaps unusual orientation of the microstructures.\n\nThe actual shape and size ofthe actinolite-hornblende solvus is undoubtedly dependent on numerous factors including pressure, temperature, and bulk composition. The work of Oba and Yagi (1987) suggests a narrowing of the solvus with increasing Fe, whereas the study of Tagin 0977) implies the opposite trend. Oba and Yagi suggest that the discrepancy may be due to FerO, content, which appears to exert a considerable influence on the extent of the gap. The experimental work of Oba (1980) and Oba and Yagi (1987) on calcic amphibole solid solutions and studies of thermal stabilities of Fe-rich calcic amphiboles by Ernst (1966) and Gilbert (1966) suggest that the crest of the actinolite-hornblende solvus will be at lower temperatures for Fe-bearing systems than for Mgrich systems.\n\nAs a result of the large number of variables controlling the size and shape of the solvus, comparison of the many published compositions of coexisting actinolite-hornblende, including the present ones, on two-dimensional diagrams may obscure the true nature of the solvus. The large volume of work pertaining to this problem has led to a good understanding of the general crystal-chemical trends in the actinolite-hornblende system. Contributions from the present paper toward that understanding include the following: l. The miscibility gap unquestionably does exist under t};Le P-T-X conditions of our samples and involves primarily the operation of three amphibole cation exchanges: edenite, tschermakite, and Fe-Mg exchange. The tschermakite exchange dominates over that of edenite, and the hornblende is significantly richer in Fe than the actinolite, consistent with previous reports.\n\n2. Actinolite-hornblende exsolution is pervasive in these samples, with spinodal decomposition thought to be the primary mechanism of phase separation.\n\n3. The compositional modulations commonly occur in two symmetrical orientations, nearly parallel to ( 132) and ( 132) of the C2/m amphlbole setting.\n\n4. In coarsened areas, the tweed microstructure is periodic, with satellite reflections appearing in SAED patterns, indicatinga25-to 35-nm periodicity.\n\n5. Optimal phase boundary calculations for intergrown actinolite-hornblende indicate that \"132\" ar.d \"132\" probably do represent minimum strain interfaces for certain combinations of lattice parameters. More importantly, the results show that optimal phase boundaries may occur over a wide range of orientations depending upon small differences in the two lattices, which are sensitive functions of composition and perhaps pressure and temperature.\n\nThe results from this study provide important new information regarding the actinolite-hornblende system, and it can no longer be argued that there is no miscibility gap between these calcic amphiboles. The door is now open for more accurate delineation of the actinolite-hornblende gap, which will require detailed TEM and AEM studies of a variety of coexisting calcic amphibole assemblages as well as additional experimental studies.\n\nWe would like to thank Michael Fleet for providing us with the EPLAG program.
