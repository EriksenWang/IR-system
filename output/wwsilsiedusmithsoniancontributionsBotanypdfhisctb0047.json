Of especial interest are a new woody species of Oxulis of obscure relationships, a group of island species of Abutilon with large showy calyces, a Rauvofia, and several new Cyrtandra taxa. The genus Geniostoma continues to yield new species in the G. rupestre assemblage. Critical taxonomic and nomenclatural studies of Tricholaena, Terminalia glabrata, Leucas, Cyrtandra, and Dichrocephala integrifolia are offered, providing correct identities and names for groups that have been troublesome. Miscellaneous minor taxonomic notes and range extensions are provided in study 18.\n\nMaterial kindly furnished by Betsy Gagne, P. A. Schafer, and W. R. Sykes has been of importance in these studies, as have been older collections loaned by the Laboratoire de Phandrogamie of the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, and by the B. P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu. The hospitality and cooperation of the authorities of the herbaria where we have visited are greatly appreciated. Travel and other expenses have been met in part by grants from the Smithsonian Research Awards Program, and the Smithsonian Fluid Research Fund. A generous grant from the National Geographic Society supported the field F. Raymond Fosberg and Marie-Helene Sachet, Department of Botany,  National Museum of Natural History, Srnithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. 20560.   and facilitated close cooperation with other naturalists engaged in their own projects in the same islands. The work of Alice R . Tangerini and Christopher R. Reinecke in making the illustrations, and of Dulcie A. Powell in dissecting and sketching difficult specimens is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nThe first five studies in this series were published as Smithsonian Contributiom to Botany, number 21, issued 21 July 1975. As in that paper, we here indicate, by citing collector's names and numbers in italics, whether we have examined the specimens cited. The herbaria where the specimens are deposited are indicated by Lanjouw system herbarium symbols as listed in the sixth edition of Index Herbariorum (Holmgren and Keuken, 1974). Additional symbols are Fo, for plants still in our hands, and LeB for the LeBronnec set of Marquesas specimens.\n\nin the Pacific Islands'\n\nTricholaena Schrader Tricholaena Schrader in Schultes, Mant., 2:8, 1824. Rhynchelytmrn Nees in Lindley, Nat. Syst., ed. 2, 446, 1836.\n\nTricholaena and Rhynchelytrum are names applied to two closely related groups of panicoid grasses widely distributed in Africa and Arabia. They are considered distinct genera by many modern floristic writers. This seems to be largely on the authority of C. E. Hubbard, who, as far as known to us, has never published any discussion giving the reasons for regarding them as distinct.\n\nThis would not be cause for much interest on the part of flora writers of other regions were it not for the widespread introduction in warm regions, including Polynesia and Micronesia, of a handsome but weedy ornamental grass of this affinity, usually called either Tricholaena rosea or Rhynchelytrum repens. In California and a few other places it is occasionally planted in gardens for its beautiful fluffy bright pink to old-rose panicles. This is probably how it gained its present pantropical distribution outside its native Africa, as it does not seem to be highly regarded as a pasture grass.\n\nFor the plant long known as Tricholaena rosea, usage changed, first to Tricholaena repens on the authority of A. S. Hitchcock, then almost at once, to Rhynchelytrum roseum and then R. repens on the authority of C. E. Hubbard. Acceptance of these chmges seems mostly to have been uncritical, following these authorities. Before accepting any of the four available names, their taxonomic and nomenclatural status should be examined. A comparison of the descriptions of the two genera in Phillips' book (195 1: 103-104) shows only one character of more than trivial value that distinguishes them: two stamens per floret in Tricholaena, three in Rhynchelytrum. A few minor features such as gibbosity versus slight curvature of the upper glume, and the presence or absence of a distinct tiny internode between the lower and upper glumes are regarded as diagnostic in Hubbard's keys (e.g., in Hutchinson and Dalziel, 1936: 50 1).\n\nAn examination of the available material of the two genera in the excellent grass collection of the U.S. National Herbarium shows little or no differente in habit or general physiognomy. Examination of spikelets of the commonest species of each genus under a fairly high magnification shows a striking similarity in their architecture, supporting the almost word-for-word identity in the generic descriptions, except for the number of stamens. We are unable to confirm from dried material available the \"lateral\" emergence of the styles from the spikelet in Rhynchelytrum, probably from lack of specimens in exactly the right stage. In Tricholaena tenertffae the styles emerge apically.\n\nThe number of stamens, 3 versus 2, is regarded as a specific difference within some grass genera, e.g., Sporobolus (Bor 1960:623;Clayton 1965:293) but scarcely seems sufficient to separate genera without other correlated substantial differentiation. The lack of anything in the ensemble of minor characters making up \"habit\" seems to us especially significant. We therefore choose to recognize only one genus, for which Tricholaena Schrader is the oldest and therefore the correct name.\n\nThe change to the specific epithet repens has been accepted as uncritically as that to the generic name Rhynchelytrum. Hitchcock made the transfer on the basis of an examination of the type of Saccharum repens by Pilger. Pilger said it was identical with Tricholaena rosea (letter, 2 July 1934, filed in the type collection, U.S. National Herbarium). Willdenow's description does not mention the characteristic red color of the hairs on the spikelets but says, \"Flores geminati sessiles candidis obvallatis.\" Hubbard, in a letter, dated 17 January 1935, filed with that from Pilger, equates the two, but in a later letter, restricts Rhynchelytrum repens to West African forms, referring other African material to R. roseum. Agnes Chase (1950:947) regarded R. rosea as distinct, saying, \"Has been confused with R. repens (Willd.) C . E. Hubb., a pale flowered annual from West Africa.\" In the U.S. National Herbarium, where the two are not separated, there are a number of sheets of such a pale-flowered plant, which seems a distinct species, but which is not confined to West Africa. It is difficult to separate, however, from old, faded examples of Tricholaena rosea.\n\nThe widely introduced reddish panicled plant, seen in many tropical countries, including a number of Pacific islands, is remarkably uniform. In Africa it is more variable, but this may largely be due to confusion of two or more species.\n\nTrzcholaena repens (Willdenow) Hitchcock, Man. Grasses W.\n\nSaccharum repens Willdenow, Sp.

(Oxalidaceae) from the Marquesas Recent Marquesan collections by P. A. Schafer and by Betsy H. Gagne include specimens of a remarkable new Oxalis without close relatives at least in the Pacific Islands. Oxalis gagneorum Fosberg & Sachet, new species FIGURE 1\n\nFrutex parvus valde lignosus, pilosus, foliis trifoliolatis petiolatis, folioliis late obovatis sessilibus ad apices rotundatis, infra glaucis; cyrnis vaide condensatis, floribus petiolatis flavis, sepalis lanceolatis mernbranaceis, petalis unguiculatis rnern-I u-branaceis 15-25 mm longis; staminibus 12-14 et 14-16 mm longis, pistillo 13 mm, stylis 5 ad apices truncatis. Type: Marquesas, Fatuiva, Gagne 12I6 (US, holotype; BISH, P, isotypes).\n\nFreely branched small shrub to 0.3-0.4 m tall, stems terete, hard, very woody, pith very small, bark smooth, dark chocolate brown, small twigs conspicuously tuberculate with persistent leaf bases and leaf and bud scars, young growth pilose; leaves crowded on apical several cm of twigs and on dwarf lateral branchlets, trifoliolate, leaflets firm, sessile, broadly obovate, up to 3.5 X 2.6 cm, apex rounded or almost imperceptibly retuse, base broadly cuneate to obtuse, upper surface green, glabrous, under surface glaucous, notably appressed pilose, veins 5-6 pairs, not very conspicuous, petioles 2-4 cm long, straight, pilose or appressed pilose to tomentulose or almost glabrous, leaf-base abruptly expanded into a densely pilose, hard, persistent clasping flange-like ridge that may represent stipules, stipules otherwise not evident; cymes in upper axils, peduncle slender, terete, 5-25 mm long, sparsely pilose, with a pair of ovate-subulate bracts at summit subtending a pair of very reduced branches, with between them a pedicel about 0.5-1 .O cm long bearing a flower, the branches each bearing 1 or 2 pedicellate flowers or these reduced to subsessile ovoid bracteate buds, the whole ramified portion very condensed, the bracts lanceolate and villous-ciliate to very pilose; sepals membranous, pale, broadly lanceolate, about 5-6 mm long, erect, sparsely pilose; petals (5-8), yellow, clawed, claws narrowing to 1.5-1.0 mm wide, 5-10 mm long, erect, claw and blade 10-12-veined, very thin, blade broadly elliptic to obovate, obtuse, spreading to reflexed, faintly ciliolate, about 1-1.5 cm long; stamens 10, filaments flat, lower portions weakly coherent, in 2 series, the shorter 12-14 mm, the longer 14-16 mm long, coherent to varying heights, anthers oblong less than 1 mm long; pollen bluish; style 2-6 mm long, with 5 branches, the whole not quite equalling to exceeding longer filaments, glabrous, apically abruptly truncate, stigmatic surfaces terminal, flat, ovary lanceolate in outline about 8 mm long including tapering apical portion; fruit broadly cylindric, 9-10 X 3-4 mm, tapering apically to a beak 1.5 mm long, styles recurved, 5-costate, costae minutely glandular, intercostal areas less so; seed glossy, brown, gently rugose, oval, about 1.0 X 1.2 mm (somewhat immature).\n\nThis remarkable species adds another to the assemblage of woody species in primarily herbaceous genera found in eastern and northern Polynesia. Its relationships are obscure, but it possibly belongs to section Caledonicae (= section Neocaledonicae) Knuth, based on 0. novae-caledoniae Knuth & Schlechter, from which it differs conspicuously in its non-obcordate leaflets, stouter stems, cymes not reduced to single flowers, clawed petals, much longer stamens, and glabrous much longer style subequal with stamens. It possibly might constitute a section of its own, or it could belong to one of the woody South American sections. This may not be determined with certainty until mature seeds are collected. The material was examined by Dr. Alicia Lourteig, who in the absence of mature seeds, hesitated to place it in any of the sections recognized in her manuscript monograph of the genus.\n\nSPECIMENS SEEN.-MARQUESAS ISLANDS: Eiao: NW side of island, Vituha Bay, windward cliff, 400 m, Gag&e /296 (US, BISH).

A New Claoxylon A.Jussieu (Euphorbiaceae) from the Marquesas The genus Claoxylon A. Jussieu is widely distributed in the Pacific islands but has not heretofore been reported from the Marquesas. It is already known in northern and eastern Polynesia from Hawaii, Tahiti, and Rapa. What is certainly a Claoxylon was collected in sterile condition by Betsy H. Gagne in 1977, on Nukuhiva Island.\n\nSeveral plants were seen \"jutting out through ferns . . . trilobed fruit heavily eaten by rats (prob-ably); non-milky sap, grass-green leaves, plants up to 3 m.\" The leaves are large, ovate or very broadly elliptic, up to 30 X 21 cm, obtuse at apex and base, margin serrate-dentate, and both surfaces very rough, rasp-like, as is frequent in Claoxylon. The petioles are up to 12 cm long and 4 mm thick when dry. Unfortunately no fruits remain on the specimens.\n\nA similar gathering from the same general locality was collected by Adamson & Mumford in 1929. Three sheets of this, US, NY, and LeB, are sterile. The Bishop Museum sheet has a pistillate raceme with several flowers. This latter specimen confirms our generic identification as Claoxylon and clearly represents a new species, which is here described.\n\nFrutex, caule 6-9 mm crasso, foliis lato-ovatis vel oblongis maxime 30 X 21 cm, racemo brevi 3 cm paucifloro, pedicel10 a bractea deltoidea subtento, floribus ca 3 mm longis latisque, sepalis 3 deltoideo-ovatis, glandibus disci in cupula connatis, ovario late ovoideo, glabro a 3 ovatis crassis sessilibus stigmatis coronato, fructu trilobato. Type: Marquesas, Nukuhiva, Adamson & Mumford 584 (BISH, holotype; US, NY, LeB, isotypes).\n\nShrub to 3 m, apparently dioecious, the youngest parts sericeous tomentose, stems thick (6-9 mm), apparently somewhat fleshy; leaves ample, drying very rough, from numerous sand-like cystoliths, broadly ovate to oblong or suborbicular, to 30 X 21 cm, apex obtuse to acutish, umbonate or slightly acuminate, thickish, main veins 7-8 on a side, midrib and sometimes main veins sparsely appressed-villous, main veins connected by slanting somewhat sinuous veins, between which is a network, margin obscurely to clearly remotely very low-serrate, the teeth with indurate bluntish to conic points that do or do not curve more or less inward, even on the same leaf, petioles thick, fleshy, 3-12 cm long, leaving a bluntly triangular to heart-shaped scar; stipules not available (or minute, ovate and sericeous hirsute?) but 2 elon-gate or somewhat triangular scars present at base of petiole; inflorescence a few-flowered raceme about 3 cm long, rachis subappressed hirsute, pedicels thick, 2-3 mm long, glabrate, subtended by triangular sheathing scale-like bracts, hirsute on outer surface, blunt-pointed; flowers about 3 mm long and wide, sepals 3, broadly triangularovate, slightly united at base, bluntly pointed, erect, strigose on outer surface; disk glands apparently united into a glabrous cup about half as high as the ovary (with a suggestion of an appendage between some sepals), ovary broadly ovoid, glabrous, with 3 spreading, flattish, ovate fleshy sessile stigmas on top; fruit said by one collector to be trilobed, but not available on specimens.\n\nThe male plant is unknown. This species seems very distinct, not closely resembling any to which we have been able to compare it. Its very short few-flowered racemes, large erect calyx-lobes, and very large leaves on long fleshy petioles are distinctive. It possibly belongs to section Indicum Pax, but without staminate flowers this cannot be determined with any confidence.\n\nSPECIMENS SEEN.-MARQUESAS ISLANDS: Nukuhiva: spur of Mt. Ooumu, Tovii Plateau.\n\nGagne 1/15 (US, BISH); Ooumu Mt., 3500 ft [lo70 m], Adamson @ Mumford 584 (BISH, holotype; US, NY, LeB, isotypes).\n\nPolynesia and Samoa: The Abutilon sachetianum Group' Three hitherto undescribed species of Abutilon in southeastern Polynesia and one in Samoa seem to form a closely related group, very distinct from anything else known from the Pacific. One of them, here christened Abutilon sachetianum, is represented by excellent material and is very fully described. It is very rare but still exists on at least two of the Marquesas Islands, Hivaoa and Mohotani. Two of the others were collected on the Mangarevan Expedition in 1934, and were even Fosberg sole author of study 9. then almost extinct. They are very likely extinct now, but I am describing them, even from inadequate material, with the hope that their publication may stimulate efforts to relocate them, and to bring about their protection, as well as to place on record our knowledge of them. The Samoan species, A . whistleri, was found by Christophersen in 1931 but lay undescribed until Art Whistler recently discovered its flowers.\n\nIt is not possible to characterize the group adequately since two of the species are too poorly known. Calyces in the group are similar, large, hemispherical or broadly campanulate with ovate or triangular lobes, and with pedicels jointed near the summit. Abutilon sachetianum and A . mangarevicum have subulate processes or spines on the fruit. The fruit of A . whistleri is muticous and densely hirsute. The fruit of A. pitcairnense is unknown. Their general similarity in appearance, with their flowers on axillary racemes or branchlets, as well as their geographical occurrence, seem close enough to justify tentatively associating them.\n\nArbor parva, foliis rotundis, stellatis, racemo laxo, gracili stellato-pilosi, floribus 3-5, longipedicellatis, calyce late-campanulato membranaceo stellato, lobis deltoideis, corolla calycem subaequanti, glabra, androecio incluso, antheribus plurimis reniformibus, carpellis 10, sublibris stellatis lanceolatis, longo-subulatis, seminibus compressis asymmetricis sparse squamatis. Type: Marquesas Islands, Hivaoa, Oliver €3 Schaifer 3193 (US, holotype; BISH, P, isotypes).\n\nShrub or small tree to 8 m tall, 20 cm diam., bark thin, pale brownish gray, wrinkled and fissured longitudinally, branches with short, close, stellate tomentum and abundant short, straight, spreading hairs; leaves strongly cordate, orbicular-ovate, 9-15 cm across, 10-17 cm long, on long petioles, sinus deep, nearly to quite closed at base, margins very slightly and irregularly crenate or undulate, apex acuminate, upper surface mi-nutely and thinly stellate puberulent, lower surface more prominently stellate pubescent, pubescence of petioles as of branches; nervation palmate, 9-nerved from base, two outer nerves much reduced, secondary nervation pinnate, the nerves once again pinnate but only on outer side, nerves connected by a ladder-like further nervation, with intervals containing a rather coarse network, margin ciliate, and with a minute, dense tuft of pubescence wherever a nerve reaches the margin; stipules linear-subulate, pilose, very early caducous, leaving small but prominent elliptic scars, the stipules between bracts in young inflorescences broader, lanceolate-subulate; inflorescence an axillary, lax raceme, with a very few reduced leaf-like bracts or usually none, up to 9 cm long, very slender, stellate pilose, with up to 5 slender elongate \"pedicels\" (really inflorescence branches plus pedicels) 3-5 cm long, jointed 3-9 mm below calyx, flowers described by collectors as \"pendent\" but on dried specimens appearing either erect or cernuous; calyx ample, broadly campanulate, from base to tips of lobes 2-2.5 cm, pale green, membranous, densely stellate pubescent within and without, with rather obscure finely anastomosing venation, lobes broadly triangular, somewhat to quite acuminate; corolla yellow, glabrous, subequal with calyx, attached well above base of stamina1 tube, blades rounded, veins fine, anastomosing forming a network near margin; filament tube about 10-12 mm long, swollen below, contracted upward, glabrous, free filament tips about 2.5 mm, numerous, anthers plump, reniform, dehiscing along outer curve along a shallow furrow, pistil at anthesis completely covered by the androecium, stigmas not showing among anthers, ovary densely stellatetomentose, 1-1.5 mm high, broadly ovate, somewhat sulcate, united part of style about 1-4 mm long, branches 8-10, unequal, 2.5-5 mm, stigmas irregularly capitate, completely included; fruiting calyx spreading, flat, star-shaped, up to 6 cm across; the 8-10 mature fruiting carpels to 17 mm long, free almost to base, densely stellate pubescent without, lanceolate in basal half, distally arcuate and long acuminate subulate, spreading, dehiscent along both sutures to base; apparently one seed maturing in the basal part of a carpel, slightly compressed, about 2 mm across, strongly asymmetric, with a prominent straight linear attachment, surface dull brown, sparsely beset with thick irregular wart-like paler brown excrescences bearing erect (or rarely appressed) pointed stiff hairs, these forming roughly circular or irregular open clumps.\n\nThe floral biology of this species, insofar as it can be guessed at from dried material, seems very unusual. As described above, the gynoecium is completely enclosed by the flask-shaped staminal tube, which is so constructed above that it seems very unlikely that much or any pollen from the pompon-like cluster of anthers above could sift down and land on the capitate stigmas on the short style-branches within. O n the same plant in different flowers the style varies greatly in length, possibly with age.\n\nAfter the basally united corolla and androecium wilt they separate by a circumscissile dehiscence from the receptacle. The carpels grow, remaining erect and connivent until the cap-like remains of the corolla and staminal apparatus are gradually finally pushed off. Then the carpels separate and spread, enlarging and forming the elongate fruiting follicles, in the center of the enlarged broadly campanulate, showy petaloid calyx. This behavior was observed in cultivated specimens growing in the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden, Lawai, Kauai, Hawaiian Islands. The two plants there produced abundant fully grown fruit. but all examined were sterile, no seeds developing. We were informed that the pollen had been examined at the Garden and proved to be abortive. The calyx has a curious arrangement of the pubescence internally. In the center is a star-shaped area of very fine matted hair. Surrounding this is a broad band of long, stellate rather stiff, dense pubescence changing toward the margin to equally dense but shorter stellate pubescence extending to the margin. In this pubescence, on some of the specimens examined, is an accumulation of pollen.\n\nA chromosome number of 2n=28 was deter-mined from plants grown from seed of Schaj2r 5563 by Royce Oliver. This number has been found six times previously in the genus (Fryxell, in litt.) though most of the counts have yielded 2n=14, 16, and 42. Subsequently, material of the Lucas collection and of Fosberg and Sachet 59503, including pickled flowers, was restudied by Oliver to determine the nature of the pollen. No pollen whatever was found, and the androecia of all flowers examined were crumpled and unexpanded, the free parts of the filaments short, the anthers poorly developed, and the styles elongated so the stigmas were exserted well beyond the androecia.\n\nThen a reexamination of all material from the Marquesas was undertaken, and all available flowers were restudied. One collection, Schaj2r 5683, from Mohotani Island, and another, Schaj2r 5563 from Hivaoa Island, with seeds, had the androecia poorly developed, exactly as in the cultivated specimens, with no pollen at all. The other flowering collections all had well-developed androecia and short styles, as in the description of the species, above. All had pollen, but not in abundance. The pollen seemed normal.\n\nOur conclusion is that the species is gyno-dioecious, a condition rare in the Malvaceae and hitherto unreported in Abutilon, according to Paul A. Fryxell (pers. comm., 13 May 1980).

New Combinations in Zehneria Endlicher (Cucurbitaceae) Zehneria Endlicher Zehneria Endlicher, Prodr. FI. Norfolk., 69, 1833\n\nAccording to Dr. Charles Jeffrey (pers. comm., also 1962:342-344) the genus Melothria L. is to be restricted to the American species, and the Pacific Islands species belong to Zehneria. Some of the Pacific Islands species have not yet been transferred to Zehneria. We are not ready to do this for all of the western Pacific species, but the one that reaches eastern Polynesia, Melothria grayana Cogniaux, seems clearly distinct and will be referred to in a forthcoming paper.\n\nJeffrey (1962:343-371) does not dispose of the Polynesian species of Melothria other than to extend the distribution of Zehneria mucronata (Blume) Miquel to Polynesia. As nearly as can be determined from the use of his key, both Samoan species ( M . samoensis A. Gray and M. grayana Cogniaux) belong in Zehneria, even though Cogniaux (1881, 1916) put M. samoensis (as M. baueriana (Endlicher) F. Mueller)) in his section Solena and M. grayana in section Eumelothria. Jeffrey's criteria for separating his genera, which correspond to some extent with Cogniaux' sections, are quite different from the characters used by Cogniaux, so it is not too disturbing that M. samoensis falls into Zehneria rather than into the genus Solena Loureiro, which Jeffrey says is only Asiatic.\n\nIn transferring Melothria grayana Cogniaux, which extends as far east as Tahiti, to Zehneria it is necessary to take into account that it was described as Karivia samoensis Gray. Cogniaux had to rename it on placing it in Melothria because of the already existing Melothria samoensis A. Gray. The combination with the epithet samoensis, however, is not yet preoccupied in Zehneria, and would have to be used if M. grayana were simply transferred to Zehneria. To avoid a confusing change from the familiar epithet grayana, it seems desirable to make the other transfer to Zehneria also, thus preoccupying the name. The question arises as to whether or not Melothria samoensis A. Gray is or is not identical with Zehneria bauerianu Endlicher of Norfolk Island.\n\nWe have seen no authentic material of Zehneria baueriana Endlicher, but comparing the detailed description of Melothria samoemis by Gray with Endlicher's excellent plates (1841 : pl. 1 16, 1 17) of Zehneria baueriana, we find them different in many respects, and we have no hesitation about maintaining the two as distinct. Since there has been, to our knowledge, no suggestion of any other disposition of M. samoemis Gray, and since it keys to Zehneria, we are transferring it to Zehneria, making legitimate the transfer of Melothria grayana Cogniaux to Zehneria. The type of Melothria samoemis A. Gray (US) seems much closer to Malesian specimens determined by Merrill as Melothria indica Loureiro, of which species we have seen no authentic material, than to Zehneria baueriana Endlicher.\n\nWe are aware that there is considerable variation in Samoan, Fijian, and Tongan material of this genus, but, until a detailed study can be made, the available specimens seem to fall reasonably into two groups, corresponding to the types of Gray's two species, which we transfer, below, to Zehneria Endlicher.\n\nMelofhria sarnoemis A Gray, Bot.

Melothria camosula Cogniaux in Fedde, Repert. Sp.

The leaf-shape varies considerably, the type having them more conspicuously triangular than any of the other specimens seen.\n\nNothing in the description of Melothria carnosula Cogniaux is notably different from the material we have referred to Zehneria samoemis.

Most have been at one time or another regarded as forms of the widespread T. catappa L., which is, in its typical, well-known form, present on most of the islands, probably as an aboriginal or recent introduction. The names, other than T. catappa, that have been used for eastern Polynesian plants are: T glabrata Forster f., described from Tahiti (and Tonga), mentioned from the Marquesas; T.\n\nharoldii Exell, described from the Austral Islands, Raivavae, Tubuai, and Rurutu; T koariki Exell, described from the Gambier Islands (Mangareva) ; T. microcarpa Nadeaud, described from Moorea; T. samoensis Rechinger, described from Samoa and reported eastward to the Society Islands and Makatea; Terminalia sp. from Raroenous form\" from the Marquesas (Brown).\n\nRepresented among these are at least three clearly distinct types: T catappa, with large bicarinate fruits; a very small-fruited type commonly known as T. samoensis including also the plant called T microcarpa Nadeaud; and a group of apparently indigenous forms with medium-sized fruits, possibly related to T. litoralis of the Western Pacific, but perhaps closer to T. catappa L. These latter are here treated as varieties of a collective species, T. glabrata Forster f., originally described from the Society Islands (and Tonga).\n\nIn addition to the indigenous or probably indigenous species, Terminalia bellirica (Gaertner) Roxburgh, indigenous to Malesia, has been cultivated in Rarotonga, Averua, 20 June 1929, Wilder 872 (BISH) (determined by A.

Esc., 52, 1786; Prodr., 74, Terminalia glabra Forster ex Cuzent, Tahiti, 232, 1860 1786. (sphalm.) This species was carefully described by Forster in De Pluntis Esculentis, fortunately, since it seems to have almost disappeared. At least it has apparently not been collected on Tahiti in this century, and only once in Raiatea.\n\nForster's description calls for a plant with glabrous peduncles, rufescent terete petioles and glabrous leaves. Such a plant was collected in Tahiti in 1856 by Nadeaud. There have been various references to the species, but apparently few collections, none at all recent excepting Moore 390 collected in 1926. Forster records it from the Society and Tonga islands. A. C. Smith refers the Tonga record, probably correctly, to T. /itoralis Seemann.\n\nTwo specimens ascribed to \"Taiti\" were collected by Suvatier (P) and are similar but have the young growth and inflorescences densely pubescent, as in plants described, but not named, by Brown from the Marquesas. They probably came from the Marquesas. Plants, presumably of this relationship, have been described from Mangareva ( T kouriki Exell), the Austral Islands (T.\n\nharoldii Exell) , the Cook Islands, Rarotonga ( T. species, Wilder), and the Marquesas ( T . catappa, indigenous form, Brown). These all seem related to T. cutuppa but to be somewhat distinct from it. The characters distinguishing them from each other are very tenuous, and we are regarding them all as varieties of T. glabrata.\n\nThis collective species may be briefly characterized as follows. Tree, often becoming very large; young bracts variously pubescent; leaves generally obovate, with base gradually narrowed to a usually short petiole, with no tendency to be subcordate; inflorescences axillary, unbranched, flowers white to pinkish, fragrant, distal flowers staminate, pedicellate, proximal flowers bisexual, sessile; fruit 2.5-5 cm long, red, fleshy, usually not strongly bicarinate, ovoid to obovoid, somewhat compressed.\n\nThe varieties of T glabrata are so variable as to be almost impossible to separate by a key, yet they seem to represent separate ranges of variation. They are, except perhaps for var. brownii, represented by too little material. When more collections of the others become available the differences either may be strengthened or may become altogether obscure.\n\nTerminalia glabrata Forster f. var. glabrata Description extracted from Forster's very full account in De Plantis Esculentis. . . , 52-54, 1786 (tr. F.R.F.) follows.\n\nLarge tree, leaves glabrous, young growth rusty-sericeous glabrate, about 17 cm long, ovate to obovate, petiole shortly reddish pubescent, terete, about 2.5 cm long; racemes in axils of uppermost leaves, glabrous (usually almost imperceptibly puberulent or rarely sparsely sericeous toward base), \"spithamei\" [a span of about 17 cm long]: flowers white, perianth campanulate, 5parted, lobes ovate, acute, erect, corolla none; nectary urceolate, in bottom of calyx, consisting of 5 small hard bodies, much hair half shorter than calyx; filaments 10, subulate, erect, inserted at bottom of calyx, the 5 outer ones as long as calyx, the inner shorter, anthers ovate, didymous, erect: hermaphrodite flowers numerous to middle of raceme, ovary inferior, sessile, ovate-oblong, thickened at base; drupe oval [almost terete], sessile, acuminate, apex withering green, nut oval, bony, with a single oblong white seed, a third the size of that of T catappa.\n\nThe following notes were made from the Forster sheet in the British Museum, here designated as lectotype. Young growth rusty sericeous, leaves to 22 X 1 1 cm almost glabrous, thin, obovate, scarcely acuminate, cuneate at base into rather slender petioles 1-2 cm long, racemes slender, sparsely sericeous toward base, almost glabrous distally, sparsely flowered, flowers sparsely puber-ulent without, calyx cup-shaped, choked within with dense brown hair (no fruit\n\n).

An opportunity to compare the type and other available material of Rapanea st. johnzi Grant with the type and only collection of Rapanea orohenemis was afforded by a visit to the B. P. Bishop Museum. It now seems obvious that these two species differ only in leaf size, M. orohenemis being at the small end of the range of variation. Four collections of this have become available which show a remarkable amount of variation in leaf size and a little variatim in shape. Maintaining two species based principally on leaf size becomes untenable in light of these collections, cited below. All are from the same area in the high mountains of Tahiti.

R. & G. Forster (Loganiaceae) Taxa\n\nSince our treatment of eastern Polynesian Geniostoma (Fosberg and Sachet, 1975: 11-14), collecting in poorly known areas has yielded three new species and two new varieties in this genus. They are from the Marquesas and Cook island groups. All would fall within the broad circumscription of Geniostoma rupestre Forster adopted by Leenhouts (1962), but this concept seems to us to obscure understanding of the insular evolution shown by this plastic genus.\n\nFrutex glaber internodiis 0.5-4 cm, foliis late ellipticis petiolis 1-1.5 mm longis, cymis valde reductis, pedicellis 2 mm longis bracteatis, corolla 2.5-3.5 mm longa, lobis 1.5-2.5 mm longis ciliolatis intus mediam hirtellis, fauce dense longepilosa. Type: Marquesas Islands, Fatuiva, Gagne I239 (BISH, holotype; US, isotype).\n\nShrub 1-1.5 m tall, stems glabrous, internodes up to 4 cm long, or much shorter, with 4 costae only when very young, leaves broadly elliptic, firm-chartaceous to subcoriaceous up to 7 X 4.5 cm, apex obtuse to very slightly acuminate, obtuse to rounded or slightly subcordate, veins 7-8 pairs, subopposite, prominent beneath, glabrate, petiole about 1-1.5 mm long and 2-2.5 mm wide; stipules reduced to a very narrow collar, almost obsolete; inflorescence a condensed cyme of 3 triads or reduced to a fascicle of 4-6 flowers or to a single triad, or even a single flower, pedicel about 2 mm long, with usually one or two ovate scale-like ciliolate bracts part-way up, sepals ovate, acutish, ciliolate, corolla 2.5-3.5 mm long, funnelform-campanulate to subrotate, tube 1-1.5 mm long, lobes ovate, with thin ciliolate margins, margins glabrous within, central parts densely hirtellous, throat long-pilose, filaments 0.5 mm wide, apex and bases of cells rounded, style glabrous, about 1.5 mm long, stigma compressed globose or slightly grooved on sides, twice as wide as long, puberulent.\n\nDistinctive as species go in this genus, Geniostoma gagneae is set apart from G. hallei by its small broad leaves, short petioles, and very much reduced inflorescences. This new species is named for Mrs. Betsy H.\n\nGagne, whose 1977 collections provide a substantial addition to recorded knowledge of the Marquesan and Society Island floras. It is endemic to Fatuiva Island, Marquesas, where it is apparently very rare on high ridges. SPECIMENS SEEN.-MARQUESAS ISLANDS: Fatuiva: at base of Mt. Satahu, 670 m, Gagne 1239 (BISH, holotype; US, isotype): 781 m, S. L. Montgomery ( B . H. Gagnb's) /267 (BISH.

Type: Marquesas Islands, Fatuiva, Gagne 1247 (BISH, holotype; US, isotype).\n\nLow bushy shrubs, stems glabrous, internodes terete even when very young, 1.5-4.5 cm long, nodose, leaves oblong-elliptic to ovate, glabrous, up to 9.5 X 5 cm, obtuse to acutish or slightly acuminate at apex, acute to obtuse at base, 8 main veins on a side, petiole 7-14 mm long; stipular collar 1-2 mm high; cymes loose, to 2.5 cm long, main axis of 2-3 internodes plus terminal pedicel, lowest node without ramification or with one pair of flowers, rarely with 2 dichasia, rarely a single extra pedicel below the dichasium, second node with one pair of flowers, or, if two internodes only, with a terminal dichasium, pedicels about 5 mm long, with 2-3 bracts, rarely none; stigma either of 2 globose lobes or these united into a double head, puberulent. This variety is rare, growing on cliffs, and is endemic to Fatuiva, Marquesas. It approaches Geniostoma gagneae, but its petioles are those of G. hallei and even longer, its inflorescences also are even more open than those of G. hallei.\n\nSPECIMENS SEEN.-MARQUESAS ISLANDS: Fatuiva, Teavapuhiau Pass (above Ouia Valley), 785 m, Gagne 1247 (BISH, holotype; US, isotype).\n\nFoliis parvis ellipticis, cymis 5(-3)-floribus reductis a var. hallei differt. Type: Marquesas, Hivaoa, Gagne 121.5 (US, holotype; BISH, isotype). Shrub 1-1.5 m, glabrous, internodes to 3.5 cm; leaves elliptic to ovate or broadly ovate, base acute to rounded, to 7 X 3(-4) cm, firm chartaceous, acute to slightly acuminate, petiole 5 mm long; cymes 1-1.5 cm long, with usually 2 nodes, the lower with a pair of flowers, the upper with a triad, or reduced to a pedunculate triad.\n\nRare, on steep windward cliffs on Hivaoa I., Marquesas. Differs especially in the smaller, more elliptic leaves and the lower triads of the cymes reduced to single flowers. The sterile specimen from Hivaoa, Brown 1096 (BISH), cited with the original publication of Geniostoma hallei, probably belongs here.\n\nFrutex vel arbuscula glaber vel vix puberulus internodiis vix quadrangularibus nodosis, foliis oblongis, ellipticis ovatis apice obtuso vel rotundato, nervis utroque costae latere 5-7, cymis 2-3trichotomis vel infra pentachotomis bracteatis, calyce valde anguste lobato, lobis carinatis, corolla alba, tub0 brevi, lobis ovatis, stylo\n\n1-1.5 mm, fructo 8 mm longo. Type: Cook Islands, Mitiaro, Ramsay in 1965 (CHR, holotype). Shrub or small tree, glabrous or rarely (1094/ Cr) slightly puberulent, twigs somewhat but not strongly puberulent, internodes (0.3-) 1-4(-5.5) cm long, nodes rather prominent; leaves oblong to elliptic or rarely somewhat ovate, up to 9 X 4.5 cm, usually smaller, thin, venation rather obscure (except in 671/CZ, from Mangaia), main veins 5-7 on a side, subopposite to alternate, apex obtuse to rounded, petiole 2-6(-10) mm, rather slender, slightly puberulent; stipular collar thin, sides very low, rounded; inflorescences in middle leaf-axils, rarely (10/7/CI) also on nodes below leaves, up to 15 mm long, glabrous, twice or usually thrice trichotomous or at lower nodes pentachotomous, bracts ovate to ovate-lanceolate, subacuminate, carinate, margins and apical parts strongly papillate-puberulent; outer flowers in dichasium immediately subtended by one or more bracts, and outer pedicels may have one or two bracts part way up; calyx lobes erect, separated nearly to base, narrowly triangular, strongly carinate, slightly acuminate, margins and acumen strongly papillate-pubemlent; corolla white, tube short, glabrous without, included in calyx or somewhat exserted, lobes ovate, deeply separated, usually somewhat clawed (or claws united into a tube in I017 b/CI) with 3 dark veins (when dry) the outer ones forked, papillate without, especially toward apex, strongly so within, apices acurish; anthers ovate-triangular, sagittate at base, 0.8-1 mm long, style distinct, sharply set off from ovary, 1-1.5 mm long, slender, stigma cylindric-capitate, 0.5 mm long; fruit valves oblang 8 X 4 mm (469/CI). This species, endemic to Mitiaro and probably Mangaia, Cook Islands, is closely related to G. quadrangulare of Rapa, differing in the less quadrangular stems, longer internodes, shorter petioles, more leaf veins, smaller, less thyrsoid and more compound dichasioid cymes, more deeply lobed calyx and corolla, and longer fruit. It is named from Mr. W. R. Sykes, who kindly made available the specimens on which it is based. SPECIMENS SEEN.-COOK ISLANDS: Mitiaro: Sykes 469/ CI (CHR); G. W.

A specimen from Mangaia (Cook Islands), Sykes 671/CZ (CHR) may belong here. It has very slender lateral branches, more prominent venation and a shorter style, but the specimen is inadequate. Geniostoma rarotongensis Fosberg & Sachet, new species Arbuscula ramulis subteretibus glabris, foliis ellipticis glabris, petiolis gracilibus 8-16 mm, cymis 2-trichotomis, calyce lobis deltoideis, corollae tub0 incluso, lobis lato-ovatis extus glabris intus dense papillato-puberulentis basi faucibusque valde pilosis; fructus desunt. Type: Cook Is., Rarotonga, Sykes 192O/CI (US, holotype). Large shrub or small tree, to 7 m tall, twigs slender, not or scarcely quadrangular, internodes 1-3 cm long; vegetative parts glabrous; leaves elliptic, at most 10 X 4 cm, usually 7-8 X 2.5-3 cm, thin, glossy above, light green, acuminate at apex, acute at base, main veins not very prominent, 5-8 on a side, subopposite to alternate, arching toward margin, anastomosing and disappearing into an obscure network, petiole slender, 8-16 mm long; stipular collar low-triangular between petioles, soon splitting and disintegrating; inflorescences, 10-14 mm long, puberulent, axillary or at nodes below leaves, 1 or rarely 3 in an axil, twice trichotomous, rarely an extra pedicel outside each branch of the lower trichotomy, each lateral branch subtended by a triangular somewhat compressed or carinate bract, each branch ending in a triad or dichasium of pedicellate flowers, each lateral pedicel subtended by a bract, each flower subtended by a pair of bractlets; sepals broadly triangular, tending to be slightly acuminate, puberulent, ciliolate, corolla white or greenish, with tube short, included in calyx, lobes very broadly ovate, obtuse, glabrous without, with 3 broken slightly branched dark veins without (when dry), ciliate, distal part within minutely but densely papillate-puberulent, basal part and throat conspicuously pilose; stigma large, globose, densely puberulent, subsessile; fruit unavailable.

It seems closest to G. astylum A. Gray of Tahiti, rather than to G. quadrangulare as we suggested previously (Fosberg and Sachet, 1975: 11-12). It differs in its much simpler, more puberulent inflorescence and more pubescent corolla throat.\n\nThe discovery of a Rauuoljia in the Marquesas extends the distribution of this genus in the Pacific from New Caledonia, the Carolines, and Hawaii to eastern Polynesia.\n\nArbor parva lactifera; foliis ellipticis 3-4 verticillatis petiolatis, axillis glandulosis glandibus elongatis; cymis terminalibus axillarescentibus triplo vel sexies dichotomis, floribus terminalibus pedicellatis plerumque caducis; tub0 corollae intus vix piloso, lobis ovatis obtusis 2.5 mm longis; fructu, subgloboso vel globoso, pyrena una compressa asymmetro-oblonga rugosa.

The developed central flower has no pair of bracts of its own. A search for triads with the lateral flowers developed yielded none even partially developed. Triads with the central flower past anthesis, or with it and its pedicel caducous, have either rudimentary or developing triads with developing central pedicellate flowers of their own. The inflorescence is built on a plan of repeated trichotomies with the central branch represented by a pedicellate flower which either forms a fruit or drops off. There apparently are no lateral flowers.\n\nIn most other species of the genus examined the ultimate cyme branches end in irregularly umbelloid clusters of pedicellate flowers which mature at different times. The cymes of R. sandwicensis are so congested that the ultimate branching habit is quite obscure, at least on herbarium specimens.\n\nSEEN.-MARQUESAS ISLANDS: Hivaoa, dry crest above Taaoa, SW of village, single tree in head of ravine in secondary scrub forest, 350 m, Sachet 2 / 1 5 (US, holotype; BISH, isotype), Sachet w i t h Decker 1885 (US, BISH, P), Schaj2r & Oliuer 5293 (US, BISH, P, MPU) [all collected from same tree].\n\nLeucas [Burman] R.

Leucas stachyoides Sprengel, Syst., 2:743, 1825.\n\nThis widespread Polynesian species has, by recent authors, e.g., Christophersen, been called L. flaccida R. Brown, under the impression that Brown's epithet has priority, doubtless because most Pacific authors have failed to include Willdenow as parenthetical author. Phlomis decemdentata Willdenow was clearly cited by Smith in the synonymy of his Leucas decemdentata. Furthermore, it is probable, but not certain, that both names were based on the Banks and Solander collection cited below. Brown definitely refers to a Banks collection, but it may have been from Australia (his symbol T) rather than Tahiti or Raiatea (Ulhitea) where Banks had his artist, Parkinson, make an excellent drawing of it.\n\nWe know the species from specimens or reliable records from the Society Islands (Meetia, Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Huahine, and Borabora) ; the Austral Islands (Raivavae) ; Samoa (Savaii, Upolu, and Tau); Cook Islands (Rarotonga); Tonga (Eu'a, Vava'u, and Nomuka); and Fiji (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Ngau). Drake (1890:263) and others refer to it from \"Iles Marquises: Malden (Macrae).\" We have not seen it from the Marquesas and it seems rather unlikely that it grew on Malden, a dry low coral island. We have not looked up the Macrae collection, which may be in either Kew or the British Museum. Drake obviously thought, incorrectly, that Malden Island was in the Marquesas. He also reported this species from Timor, but did not cite a specimen. This record may well refer to one of the known Malesian species. However, material L. linifolia 25 from New Guinea, Brass 28094, 29325 (both US), determined as Leucas javanica Bentham, seems to belong here, so a Timor occurrence is not impossible.\n\nThe impression, originally shared by us, that\n\nL. decemdentata may not be native in eastern Polynesia, based on its sometimes weedy occurrence, seems less likely, since it was collected on Captain Cook's first visit to the Society Islands. Vernacular names in the Society Islands are variants of Niuroaiti.

This widespread south and east Asiatic and Malesian species has generally been known as Leucas lavandulaefolia J. E. Smith. However, in his original publication of this name, Smith cited Leonum indicus L. as a synonym, rendering Lacas lavandulaefolia superfluous and illegitimate, typified by Leonum indzcus L. (ICBN Art 7.1 1). Leon u m indicus cannot be transferred to Leucas because of Leucas indica R. Brown ex Sprengel, based on Phlomis indicus L. In 1942 it was collected in Fiji, Viti Levu, by Greenwood 916, not seen by us but so determined by A. C. Smith. It was again collected in 1970 in Fiji by J . W. Parham I7325 (US) in Nadroga-Navusa, Cuvu Sand Hills. It was found in the Palau Islands, Babeldaob, in 1969 by Carl Sulsedo I64 (US), the first record from Micronesia. Leucas zeylanica (L.) J. E. Smith Leucas ztylanica (L.) J. E. Smith in Rees, Cyclopaedia, 20: Phlumis ztylanica L., Sp. PI., 586, 1753. LEU. 1812.\n\nThis species has previously been known only as far east as the Malay Archipelago and the Philippines. It was collected in the Marquesas in 1838-1840 in \"Nuhiva-Archipel des Marquises,\" by Hombron (P) on the voyage of the Astrolabe and Zelee We have not seen other specimens of it from there. It may have been an early accidental introduction which has not persisted. There is, of course, the possibility of a confusion of labels.\n\nIn spite of the detailed monograph of South Pacific Cyrtandra by the late George W. Gillett (1973), study of recent collections from the Marquesas has yielded a number of new taxa and a reinterpretation of one of the most remarkable already known ones, Cyrtandra jonesii (F. Brown) Gillett. A new key to the known Marquesan taxa of Cyrtandra is presented. Forster, Char. Gen., 5-6, Tab. 3, 1776. Cyrtandruidea F. Brown, Bishop Mus. Bull., 130:323, 1935. Herbs or usually shrubs, rarely small trees or vinelike, often notably pubescent, stems and petioles with a tendency toward fleshiness; leaves generally opposite, simple; inflorescences cymose, usually bracteate, axillary or on old wood or even on roots; flowers usually bisexual; calyx enclosing bud, variously lobed or cut, lobes valvate, sometimes spathe-like; corolla usually zygomorphic, 5lobed and bilabiate, lower lobe generally larger, rarely almost symmetrical, usually white, often thinly fleshy, lobes usually imbricate; stamens usually 2, rarely 4, 5, or 6, often with 1-3 reduced ones or staminodes in addition, filaments inserted on or adnate to corolla tube well below sinuses; ovary subtended by a disk-like nectary, 1-or rarely 2-loculed, placenta 5-parietal or rarely axile, fleshy, ovules many, style one, stigma bilobed or rarely capitate; fruit a soft berry, white or copper-colored to variously greenish, pink or even red; seeds small, many.  2. Stems, petioles, and cymes pubescent 3. Whole plant densely brownish pilose 3. Plant mostly pubescent but not uniformly densely pilose (Cyrtandra\n\nThis species was described by Brown as the basis of a new genus, Cyrtandroidea, which he placed in the Campanulaceae. This genus was transferred by Burtt (1968:217-2 18) to the Gesneriaceae and the species was transferred by Gillett to Cyrtandra. We completely concur with both of these dispositions.\n\nFurther study of the original material of Cyrtan- dru jonesii (F. Brown) Gillett and of subsequent collections referred to this species suggests that two species are involved.\n\nBrown's description of Cyrtandroidea jonesii was based on two fragmentary collections, a flowering specimen from Uahuka (Jones I712 (BISH)) designated as lectotype by Gillett The two collections available to Brown do not look especially alike. There is an enormous discrepancy in the size of the leaves, and the inflorescences were said to have been borne directly on large branches, i.e., cauliflorous, in the Jones specimen from Uahuka. This also has the under surface of the leaves very thinly pubescent, rather glabrate, the margins irregularly dentate or serrate.\n\nFortunately several subsequent collections have been made of the Nukuhiva plant, which has much smaller leaves notably villous beneath, subserrate, the cymes borne among the leaves. The floral details are different, also, from those described by Brown. There appear to be two related species, each confined to a single island. Gillett's description was probably prepared mostly, if not entirely, from his own 2156, an ample collection from Nukuhiva in the same area as the Quayle material, which is similar; hence it applies to the Nukuhiva species if, as we have concluded, two species are included in C. jonesii.\n\nThe following description of Cyrtandra jonesii sensu strict0 is compiled from our notes on the vegetative and inflorescence features of the Jones collection (Uahuka) and from Brown's description of its flowers. It is very inadequate, but cannot be augmented until the plant is recollected.\n\nTree 4-6 m tall; leaves up to 40 X 25 cm, base broadly acute, margin irregularly dentate, blade thick, brittle, somewhat pubescent beneath especially on veins, glabrate, petiole thick, short, 2.5 cm on smaller leaf; inflorescences said by the collector to sprout directly from larger branches, specimen shows 2 detached cyme branches (\"floriferous shoots racemoid\") 10-20 cm long, their nodes with amplexicaul bract scars and large, very prominent, roughly circular pedicel scars, \"shoots. . . simple or bifurcate, according to collector\"; internodes 10-12 mm long, 3-4 mm thick, pubescent when young, glabrate; bracts orbicular-ovate, about 2 cm long, caducous, clasping at base, puberulent; \"flowers sessile or shortly pedicellate, odorless, in dry specimens persistent only at the tip of the floriferous shoot; calyx campanulate, 30-35+ mm long, 15+ mm wide in dry compressed specimens, puberulent on the outer surface, brown when dry, the 5 lobes unequal, triangular acute, 7-14+ mm in length from the base of the sinus; corolla funnel-shaped, up to 5+ cm long, the 5 lobes oblong, obtuse, unequal, 15-20 mm in length, the dorsal slit not extending beyond the middle, the inner and outer surface more or less pubescent, and the tube with a row of glands at the base and, according to the collector, containing 'about a teaspoonful of colorless viscous liquid in appearance like glycerine'; stamens 5, the filaments flattened and united into a glabrous tube 22+ mm long and up to 4+ mm in width (when compressed), the anthers oblong acute, 5+-mm in length, glabrous, not penicillate, free (at least in dry specimens); mature style projecting 7 2 mm beyond the anthers, curved, conspicuously hairy outside, the 2 stigmatic lobes 2+ mm long, puberulent on the outer surface; ovulary superior or nearly so, conical, 2-3+ mm in length, glabrous, 2-locular, the outer walls rather thin, the central axis of the septum, more or less inwardly curved or rolled at the sides.\" The other collection cited by Brown, Quayle I243 from Nukuhiva, and matched by a number of subsequent collections also from Nukuhiva is of quite a different plant, also with 5 stamens. It is here described as Cyrtandra thibaultii.\n\nCyrtandra thibaultii Fosberg and Sachet, new species FIGURE 6 Cyrtandra joneszz sensu Gillett, Cniv. Calif. Pub.

Oournu, 790 m, Gugne 1048 (US, BISH); between Taiohae Bay and Hooumi Bay, above 700 m, Gugnei 1150 (US, BISH).\n\nThis species and the closely related C. jonesii are very onusual in their regular or almost regular corollas, five fully developed stamens, and axile rather than parietal placentation. They differ in the size and pubescence of leaves, position of inflorescences, shape of bracts, length of pedicels, shape of calyces, two narrower corolla lobes of C. thibuultii, length and shape of anthers, and other more minor characters.\n\nWhether or not the above characters that the two have in common, especially the axile placentation, provide suficient ground for maintaining the genus Cyrtandroideu Brown is a question. Gillett (1973:55) says that Cyrtundru rurotongensis Cheeseman, of the Cook Islands, also has axile placentae, and he quotes Burtt as saying that several other species of Cyrtandru do. His description of C. rarotongensis does not suggest a very close relationship with the two Marquesan species. It seems best, until more information is available about placentation of the genus as a whole, to retain Cyrtan- droideu in Cyrtandru, following Gillett.\n\nIncidentally, examination of plate 3, figure f, accompanying the original description of Cyrtandra, shows that the Forsters must have had a species with axile placentation, as the drawing clearly shows two cells with bilobed axile placentae. Unfortunately, the Forsters did not indicate which of their two species, C. bijlora and C. cymosa, was used in drawing the fruit; however, St. John (1966:3-5) showed that the Forsters' illustration portrays Cyrtandra biJora, of Tahiti, which St. John there designates as lectotype species of the genus.\n\nCyrtnndra ootcrrtis F. Brown, Bishop Mus. Bull., 130:273, 1935. This species is not uniform, varying in density of pubescence, density of toothing on leaf margins, length of petiole, in the length and looseness of the inflorescence, and in the width of the corolla. These variations do not correlate very well, but at least four easily perceptible varieties can be sorted out, two of them on Hivaoa, one on Fatuiva and one on Uahuka.\n\nLeaves almost glabrous above, except midrib pubescent when young, sparsely pilose beneath except densely subappressed pilose on veins beneath; cymes densely appressed long-pilose, corolla slender, dilated from 3 mm wide below when pressed to 5 mm near summit, sparsely tomentulose on outer surface, young fruit sparsely hirtellous.\n\nThe type of this species ( F . Brown 96I) has leaves that are much less pubescent and very obscurely serrate in comparison with the other available material. The petioles are also more slender than in most of the other material. Two other specimens cited below seem to belong with\n\nA sterile specimen from Mt. Feani is from a creeping woody stem, rooting at nodes, has leaves much like var. ootensis but practically glabrous.

This doubtless represents an undescribed species, but since the specimens are so nearly sterile it seems best not to name it until flowering or fruiting specimens can be obtained.\n\n17. Nomenclature of Dichrocephala integrifolia (L. f.) 0. Kuntze (Asteraceae) Dichrocephala L'Heritier Dzchrocephala L'Heritier in de Candolle, in Guillemin, Arch. de Botanique, 2:517-518, 1833; in de Candolle, Prodr., 5: 372, 1836.\n\nThis is a small genus of Asteraceae, commonly placed in the tribe Astereae, with a few African and Asiatic species, one of which extends into the Pacific to Polynesia. The name of the widespread species has been the subject of some disagreement. This we discuss below, with records of its occurrence in Polynesia.\n\nThere has been an unusual amount of nomenclatural confusion concerning the small weedy, apparently medicinal, plant most commonly but incorrectly called Dichrocephala latiflia (Lamarck) de Candolle. This species, according to ING is the type (lectotype) of the genus Dichrocephala L'Hdritier, though the parenthetical author is there given erroneously as Persoon, when it should be Desfontaines.\n\nAlthough there now seems to be no doubt that the correct name of this common widespread Indo-Pacific species is Dichrocephala integriffia (L. f.) 0. Kuntze, it seems worthwhile to give in some detail the history of the case so that users of this name will not have to go to the trouble that we have experienced in verifying its correctness.\n\nThe following annotated synonymy is arranged chronologically by first dates of publication of the principal early names involved.\n\nDichrocephala integrifolia (L.f.) 0. Kuntze\n\nCotula bicolor Parkinson, Jour. Voy. Endeavour, 43, 1773 [nomen nudum]. Ethulza paniculata Houttuyn, Nat. Hist., 11, 14:551, t . 67, f.2, 1779.-Merrill, Jour, Am. Arb., 19, 371, 1938. [Non Dichrocephala paniculata Miquel, FI. Ind. Bat. 2:38, 18561. [Miquel's name is sometimes thought to be a transfer of the Houttuyn species, but it was not accompanied by any mention of an earlier publication, nor did Miquel cite Houttuyn's type. Hence, any transfer of E. paniculata to Dichrocephala would create an illegitimate later homonym.] Hippia integrifolia L.f., Suppl. PI., 389, 1781.-Aiton, Hort. Kew., 3:278, 1789. [Specimen 1039.1 in Herb. LINN, London, which can be considered the type of Hippia integrifolia, is, so far as can be determined from a good microfiche photo, the plant ordinarily called Dichrocephala latifolia. The leaves are broadly ovate, coarsely serrate, have up to 8 teeth on a side, with 3 nerves from the base and one more pair just above the base, so it could be called 5-nerved. The inflorescence and heads are correct, racemose-paniculate, discoid. Thus the application of H . integrifolia seems reasonably certain. H. integrifolia therefore apparently provides the earliest available epithet for transfer of this plant to Dichrocephala.] Cotula bicolor Solander ex Forster f., Prodr. 91, 1786 [nomen nudum]. Grungea [ latifolia] Lamarck, Tabl. Encycl., 3:pl. 699, 1796. [This is undoubtedly the plant under discussion, but the plate bears only the name Grungcu, with no specific epithet. This was supplied in the text, which did not appear until 1823. Therefore the plate cannot serve to validate the binomial, G. latifolia.] Cotula bicolor Roth, Catalecta PI., 2: 116, 1800.-Persoon, Syn. PI., 2:464, 1800 (in syn.). [Roth's publication of his binomial is valid and the epithet is available. Merrill (1954:350) states that Roth, when he published this binomial in 1800, knew nothing of the two earlier, invalid uses of the same binomial, but gave no reasons for his belief. In any event, Roth made no reference to any earlier use, so his epithet originated with his 1800 publication.] Grungca latifolia Desfontaines, Tableau de I'Ecole Bot., 95, 1804.-Lamarck in Poiret, Encycl. Meth. Suppl., 2:826, 1812; Tabl. Encycl., 3:276, 1823. [After much search, we conclude that Desfontaines is the earliest author to publish the epithet 1atz'Joliu for this plant, though i t is usually ascribed to Lamarck. Persoon, in his treatment of Colula latifolia (1806, see below) referred to \"grangea latifolia Desf. l.c.,\" which refers back to \"Desf. Cat. H.P. 95.\" This turns out to be a reference to Desfontaines, Tableau de I'Ecole Bot.? 95, 1804. Desfontaines published the name Grangea lat$ofolia with four words of description-\"ia feuill. larges @\"-enough to effect valid publication. The sign 0 was used in older works to indicate that the plant is an annual. Though it is antedated by Ethulia paniculata Houttuyn (1779), Hippia integrifolia L. f (1781), and Cotula bicolor Roth (1800), it is not illegitimate, as would have been either Persoon's or Lamarck's (Poiret's) uses if they had been earliest, as they both cited Cotula bicolor Roth in synonymy, which would have made them superfluous. The parenthetical author for any transfer of this epithet should, however, be Desfontaines, rather than Lamarck or Persoon, both of which have been used. This, of course, is academic, as the earliest available epithet is supplied by Hippia integrifolia L. f. (1 78 1) .] Cotula latifolia (Desfontaines) Persoon, Syn. PI., 2:464, 1806.

[This is the name that has usually been used for the plant under consideration since 1836. Before 1836 it had been, under several specific epithets, referred to several genera, as listed above. Under the \"Kew Rule\" this would have been correct. Under all post-1905 codes of botanical nomenclature the oldest available specific epithet must be used. De Candolle, in his Prodromus treatment (1836) listed a number of binomials, mostly herbarium and manuscript names, in the synonymy of D. latifolia. Since most of these were not validly published we are not listing them here. They are referred to by Index Kewensis as first published \"ex DC. Prodr. V. 372.\" Exceptions are Cotula bicolor Roth (and its derivative Hippia bicolor Smith, see above), and Spilanthus atriplicifolius L., which is a validly published species now referred to another genus, Lipocarpha. Cotula sinapzjiolia Roxburgh may refer to the plant of that name in Roxburgh's Hortus Bengalenris (1814:62), but that is very dubiously published, indeed, besides being later than several other available names listed above.] Dichrocephala bicolor (Roth) Schlechtendal, Linnaea, 25:209, 1852.-Exell, Cat.

[Weibel was the first modern author to use D. integrifolia, merely giving the Kuntze name and its basionym, with no comment. He has been followed by a few of the more critical workers on Asiatic plants.

This plant is found from Africa to the Society Islands and, apparently, Hawaii, though it has not been seen there since David Nelson collected it on Captain James Cook's voyage in 1779. Sydney Parkinson, artist to Joseph Banks, on Captain James Cook's first voyage around the world, in 1769, made an excellent drawing of this species, now in volume 1, no. 48, of the unpublished collection of Parkinson drawings in the British Museum (Natural History). This demonstrates, beyond any doubt, that this species was in Tahiti in the pre-European period. Seemann's record of it from the Marquesas, citing a Barclay specimen, repeated by Drake, seems, with little doubt, to be based on a misidentification of Barclay's specimens of Adenostemma. No Barclay specimen of Dicrocephala was found in the British Museum by J. B. Marshall in his study of the Barclay collection (unpublished). It is reputed to have medicinal properties and is said to have been cultivated in several islands. Its Polynesian distribution is as follows, so far as known.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL RECORDS AND SPECIMENS SEEN.-~OCIETY ISLANDS: Banks and Solander, fide See-  rnann (1866). Drake (1892).

By 1974 it had spread to an alarming extent. Today it has supplanted all other vegetation on certain slopes on the south side of the island, is spreading everywhere in the moist valleys, and is proving to be serious competition for the native vegetation.\n\nIt is a small to medium sized tree, with large ovate to broadly elliptic, strongly trinerved leaves and large panicles of small white flowers. These produce clusters of blue-black fleshy berries about the size of peas. Thus it is penfectly adapted to be spread by frugivorous birds. This is the first record of it, and of the genus Mzconza, from the Pacific islands. It is naturalized and spreading in Jamaica and Ceylon in moist areas. Its native range is from Mexico through Central and South America to Brazil. It appears to be a major threat to the already endangered flora of Tahiti.\n\nThis information was kindly passed on to us by Dr. John Wurdack, who in 1971 established the synonymy given above. The plant is known to the authorities in Tahiti as Miconia magnijica.\n\nCordza lutea Larnarck, Tabl. Encycl., 1:421, 1972. In 1966, we discussed the occurrence of this American species in the Marquesas. It was then thought that this was its western limit. However, a specimen collected in Tonga by the U.S. Exploring Expedition (US), determined as C. rotundifoliu Ruiz & Pavon, is undoubtedly a small-leafed, unusually densely short-hispid form of C. lutea Lamarck.\n\nIt has apparently not been found in western Polynesia since that time. The possibility cannot, of course, be excluded that this specimen was mislabelled."
