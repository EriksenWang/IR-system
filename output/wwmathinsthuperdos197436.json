    "full_text": "1 . Introduction . In 1967 we prepared a collection of unsolved problems for the Set Theory Symposium held at UCLA which finally appeared [6] four years later in the Proceedings of the Symposium in 1971 . However, we distributed a mimeographed version of the paper in 1967 and since then several people worked on some of these problems and obtained solutions . We tried to keep [6] up to date by adding remarks to the page proofs, but we believe it will be more useful if we give a survey of the new results obtained by various people .\n\nWe will use this opportunity to mention some entirely new problems, to announce some of our (as yet) unpublished results concerning the old problems, to give some further explanation about those old problems which were either vaguely or incorrectly stated in [6], and to revise the so-called \"simplest\" forms of these unsolved problems which we are still in touch with and for which partial progress has been made .\n\nThe notation and terminology will be the same as in [6] . A number of the problems here involve Martin's Axiom which is not mentioned in [6] . We denote by MA b the following statement : For every partially ordered set (C, <) satisfying the countable chain condition and for every family F , ~F1 < b, of dense subsets of C, there is G -C such that G is C-generic over J~' . Martin's Axiom-MA-is the assertion that MA, holds for all b < 2& . (For references, see [20] and [27] .) 2 . About the old problems for the ordinary partition relation . We will assume that the reader is familiar with [6] .\n\nThe status of Problems 1-5 concerning the ordinary partition symbol for cardinals did not change . Problem 4 can be stated in the following more comprehensible form : This would be an immediate generalization of the well-known Erdös, Dushnik, Miller theorem (a (a, Ko) 2 for a >= Ko) and by the results of [10] it is true if either a is regular or a is strong limit . (Note that the conditions of the problem are obviously necessary since cxo +-> (c+, K l )2 for c ? Xo and cf(a) +-> (cf(a), d) 2\n\nimplies a -1 + (a, d) 2 for every d and a.)\n\nThere has been considerable progress concerning Problems 6-13, stated in [6, 3 .2, 3 .3] .\n\nWe learned that the theorem of Galvin and Hajnal [6, p . 21] was independently discovered by L . Hadded and G . Sabbagh (see [14]) . A much stronger \"canonicity\" theorem is proved in Chang's paper [3] . For an explicit statement of this theorem see [21] .\n\nProblem 6 as it stands is s olved . w s --> ((0 3 , 6) 2 holds by a remark of E . C . Milner .\n\nHowever, we know of no general results which would make the computation of f (k, n) of Problem 6 practically possible at least for small values of k and n . For a more detailed exposition of problems arising here see [21] .\n\nWe already mentioned in [6] that Problem 7 has been solved by THEOREM (CHANG) . ww --> (co', 3)2 [3] .\n\nChang worked out a very deep method for the proof . It is not known if (b) holds for K > co under the weaker hypothesis a , (a)z .\n\nThe following remains open Is w' P (co\"', n)2 true for n < w, 0 < p < w l ? Galvin remarked that if co\" -( (o 2 , 3) 2 then a is of the form wP if 2 < a < w l . It would be interesting to know whether there is an order type for which\n\nThere are many results relevant to Problem 8, though none of these gives an answer to the problem as it is stated . We know THEOREM (LAVER) . MA N, implies w l , (co, [co, wl])2 . i\n\nThis was generalized in [2] .\n\n1 For typographical reasons we use this notation instead of w l -> (w,, THEOREM (BAUMGARTNER-HAJNAL) . MA . , implies w l -> (co l , [a, co,])' for aC < w l .\n\nIt is reasonable to ask : Does MA. , + 2 m ° _ X 2 imply w l , (co l , w + 2) 2 or w i , (a), a) 2 for a < w l ?\n\nThe following result is relevant to Problem 8 .\n\nTHEOREM (KUNÉN [19 .1]) . Assume a is real valued measurable . Then a (a, a) 2 for a < co, This certainly shows (with reference to a well-known result of Solovay) that 2 K o +-> (2a0, a) 2 cannot be proved for any o + 2 < a < co l without some hypothesis on 2K0 . On the other hand, C .H . w l +i (co,, w + 2) 2 can be slightly generalized . THEOREM (LAVER, UNPUBLISHED) . Assume MA . ., + 2mo = X 2 . Then 602 +4 ((02, w + 2) 2. Laver's proof breaks down for 2 K u = K 3 . The following problem is relevant : Assume MA + 2 1 0 = K3 . Let ~S1 _ X 2 , F -[S] 14 1, Jj <_ 8 2 and assume ~A n BI < K o for every pair A 0 B E . Does F then possess property B(H,)? This is a variant of Problem 39, where we asked the same question for ~S1 ,F1 _ N .+i assuming the G .C .H . Galvin proved w 2 ((o, w + 2) 2 and mentioned to us that w 2 (Col, (o + 3) 2 , w2 _\" ( (OD ((0 + 2) 2 ) 2 and many similar problems remain open if we do not assume G .C .H .\n\nThe following theorems of Baumgartner show further progress in the direction of two previously mentioned results .\n\nCon(ZFC + co, , (stationary subset of (o l , [a, col ])2 ) for a < w, and Con(ZFC + w\" -H (w,,, w + 2)2) for n < w .\n\nProblem 9 stands as it is . This seems to be the case with most of the problems where the underlying set has cardinality X .,, .\n\nAs to the Problems 10, 10/A, 10/B, 11, 11/A, the following was proved :\n\nTHEOREM (BAUMGARTNER-HAJNAL [2]) . Assume (D --)-(co)K o . Then -> (a), , k for a < wl , k < w . This result yields (01 (a)k and íl -~ (a)k for a < co, k < w, and so we have a positive answer to Problem 10 with p = 0, Problem 10/A, Problem 11, 11/A .\n\nThe proof of the above mentioned theorem given in [2] is of a metamathematical character . It is first proved that if MA f ,,, holds, then the theorem is true . Then the result is proved by \"absoluteness\" arguments .\n\nFinally F . Galvin discovered a combinatorial proof of the Baumgartner-Hajnal theorem . He also generalized the theorem for types of partially ordered sets . THEOREM (F . GALVIN) . Let T be a partial order type such that -> (?) )H o . Then (The meaning of the , relations extends to partial order types in a self-explanatory way .) Galvin mentions that he does not know if (m)K o implies 97, (a)k (a < k < co) for partial order types 9) . As to the earlier history, some results are already stated in [6] . The topic was extensively studied by F . Galvin, and it is fair to say that even the general conjecture was due to him .\n\nGalvin's old theorems .\n\n(1) (D-i-> (o))H, ( D+* (co, (o + 1) 2.\n\n(ü) In all the earlier results (stated e .g . in [6]) the conditions w,, coi ~ 4), X01 >_ X 1 can be replaced by\n\n(iv) If 101 = oi l and q) ((0 , a l , . . . , ak ) 2 then col -> (al , . . . , a k)2. Unfortunately, Galvin's nice results remained unpublished for years . The strongest result proved with \"conventional methods\" before Galvin's new proof is due to Prikry . He proved co l , (w 2 + 1, a)2 for a < co, (See p . 272 for his general result .)\n\nAs to the part p > 0 of Problem 10, the situation is quite different . THEOREM (PRIKRY [22]) .\n\nCon(ZFC + G .C .H . + ( w2/ +> c . 1 1 Hi (See the remarks concerning Problem 24 where we will state Prikry's result in greater detail .) With a slight generalization Hajnal proved Con(ZF)\n\nand also Con(ZF)\n\nNow the following would be interesting to see :\n\nIs o02 ->((0l + W)2 or even w 2 ()2 for ~ < cu e consistent with G .C .H . ?\n\nBy the independence results the best possible theorem which still can be true is\n\nWe proved w 2 , ( co, + n)2 for n < w several years ago, but we do not know at present : Does G .C .H . imply o)2 , ( a), + 2)3? (This might be a problem of type D .) Considering the above mentioned negative consistency results the following problem arises : Assume G .C .H . Is it true that for every a < co, there is $ < co, such that (a) We wish to comment on Problem 12 . The problem is vaguely formulated and it really calls for the investigation of the strength of the following assumptions :\n\nGiven ~R, <), typ R(<) _ 0, what is the relation among the assumptions (i) R contains a countable dense subset, IRI > K, .\n\nThis was realized again by F . Galvin . He proved, e .g ., (iv) is equivalent to (iii) V co, _< (D and also gave a number of necessary and sufficient conditions for (iii) and (iv) . These results are unpublished as well .\n\nHe stated the problem if (iv) implies (v), the answer is negative by\n\nThere is 0, 101 = K, which satisfies (iv) but not (v) .\n\n(b ) If V = L then there is a 0, such that j (D I = X, (co}', and T -f-* (W)' for every \" < 0, IT I < K 2 .\n\n(c) Con(ZFC + 3 a weakly compact cardinal)\n\n• The first part of Problem 13 was solved as THEOREM (HAJNAL [i5]) . Assume G .C .H . and that K a is regular, then The first part solves a problem of [7] where we discussed several related problems .\n\nJust as in the case of Problem 8, the following problems (of type D) can be stated : Let a be real valued measurable, K = i2(a) . Does K 2, (K2 , 3) 2 hold? ADDED IN PROOF . Kunen proved that the answer is affirmative . Does MA ., + 2 10 = K2 imply w1-> (cvl, 3) 2 . In [7] we proved C02 (w l a, 3) 2 for a < co, but we do not know if wi , (co l co, 4) 2 .\n\nAnother result of [7] states that assuming C .H . p+-> (cot, 3)2 holds for every p < co2 ; but our proof does not generalize for types corresponding to larger cardinals . The following result is relevant : THEOREM (JEAN LARSON) . If X . is regular then wá+1~( U,á+1~3)2 3 . The old problems for symbol 11. As to Problem 15, we know THEOREM (GALVIN, SHELAH [13]) . (a) 2 1 0 [2~'°]k o (even more generally cf(2'o)-+ [cf(2Ko)]K o and H,4-> [Njax ) • (b) xl [x114-(a) is best possible in the sense that if a carries an N, -saturated a-complete ideal, then a -* [a] a1 . ,, holds . Baumgartner noticed that 2 10+ [ti l ] K o is consistent with 2 K °= anything reasonable (even 210 = real valued measurable) . S . Shelah proved that 2 1 % <_ N,+,, implies xx+nom [xQ+n]x~+n for n < co .\n\nWhen n = 1 this reduces to the old result of [10] . In [10] we claimed G .C .H . w2+-* [w1]3 . We can prove a slightly stronger statement . COROLLARY . Í -[ vl]H x1 1. 4. Symbol III and related problems . Most of the Problems 19-21 were asked and investigated quite independently of our asking them . For the convenience of the reader we quote some results we know of . Problem 19 . K 2 , [K I ] 2 J , ap Is equivalent to X 2 -* [KI]H1 K o , and this is equivalent to Chang's conjecture which is known to be independent . For results and references see Silver's paper [26] . The same applies for Problems 19/A, 19/B . Probem 19/C . J . Baumgartner proved that (it is consistent relative to a large cardinal that) 19/A J> 19/B, i .e . the almost disjoint transversal property does not imply Kurepa's hypothesis . Problem 19/D . A positive answer is obviously consistent . We know of no consistency result from the other direction .\n\nM . Magidor remarked recently that V = L implies : There are 2a almost disjoint stationary subsets of f2(a) for every regular a .\n\nProblem 21/A is discussed in Kunen's thesis [19] .\n\nLet p o = sup{p : there is a sequence fv, v < p satisfying (00) of 21/Al . It is proved in [19] that assuming G .C .H ., po < w 3 , but it is consistent to have po \"arbitrarily large\" . By Silver [26], pp = co t is consistent . Is po > co t true in L? THEOREM (LAVER) . '177 \\ ,\\ ri, . . .,rn 77 ~17 , ~19i (r,+ . . .+r,) 1 . (r,+ . . .+rp n)! +1 As to Problem 20 or rather Problem 20/A, one obtains quite similarly that there is p < w3 such that P [w2 1]K I .K o and that it is consistent to have p+-> [w21]K I , No to arbitrarily large p . We do not know if w22 [w21]x 1 , Ko is consistent . This would follow e .g . from the consistency of the negation of Problem 19/D . 5 . Symbol IV and polarized partition relations . Problem 22 . F . Galvin proved that a -* (b)2 Ro is equivalent to a (b) \"'-No . Problem 24 . We know the theorem of Prikry mentioned, i .e . the consistency of ~X,) [á\\O] 1 Prikry proved that the following is consistent with ZFC + G .C .H . : PRIKRY'S PRINCIPLE . There is f:co t X w l oj l such that for every A E [co 2 ]ao, B E [co i] NI there is a c-A with R(f I ({a} X B)) = w l . THEOREM (JENSEN) . The Prikry principle is true in L . This result probably extends to most generalizations of the Prikry principle we will mention in this paper . Problem 26 . Trivially, MA ( o) H [2' o] u o . ZFC + 2 xo > Kl is very likely consistent with (Hoo) (ó°) \" but we do not know if it has already been proved . The following results might be relevant . THEOREM (BAUMGARTNER) . Both wl) --a ((O)HO and \\co, r~( w)ao are consistent titi•ith ZFC + 2 ao > K 1 . Problem 27 . The consistency of ~xo)Ko is not known . The results of [10] listed on p . 32 of [6] left the following problem open : Does (H2) -~ (H 1)k' hold for 3 <_ k < w? As a corollary of the generalization of the Prikry principle mentioned on p . 272 it is easy to see that the following statements are consistent with G .C .H . : (x) +~( 1)I I and ( X 2) -+-> (`, ,)2) v i\\2, (x1 I. `` 1,1 G .C .H . (Xt) -(N2 v ,, K1) is proved in [10] . On the other hand we have UNSOLVED AND SOLVED PROBLEMS IN SET THEORY 2 7 7 THEOREM (HAJIVAL) . G .C .H . (a) (K2) (K ;l s 1 , (b) (K3/ ( (' 11) , K2) LI ' K 2 KI Hp K2\n\nThe second statement gives an answer to Problem 12(2) of [10] .\n\n6. The rest of the old problems . Problem 29 . Shelah pointed out that the problem as stated is obviously false . The problem we had in mind is the following :\n\nA is said to be weakly-canonical with respect to (S S),~~ if X, Y E [S]r and X ( This was proved independently but later by K . J . Devlin as well in [4] . In [4] there are many interesting and relevant results we do not quote here .\n\nThe most up to date results are now in the preprint of Devlin and Paris [5] .\n\nIf there is an a such that (a, < X, 2) K, then O# exists .\n\n(b) Assume V = L[D] it -here D is a normal ultrafilter on a measurable cardinal .\n\nThen, for all cardinals a and all regular cardinals b, This was realized by many people .\n\n(B) Hajnal remarked that Con(ZF) Con(ZFC + G .C .H . + (Xx.+2, 3, 2)+4 \"k+l) for k < w .\n\nIs it true that (X,, 3, 2) K, is consistent with ZFC + G .C .H .? Is (X, 4, 2)+-* K, consistent with ZFC + G .C .H . ? Problem 35 . The problem was badly stated . In [10,Theorem 49] we already proved that under the conditions of the problem there is a free set of power X . . The real problem is if there is a free set of power 9 .+, , Problem 36 . A positive answer follows from w, (a)2 . However, the following stronger results are true LetP*(z) be the following statement . If typ S(<) = a, then there is ` -[S]\" such that I A n BI< X o for A 0 B E and for all X E [S]w if X is not contained in the union of finitely many members of .F, then there is A c-, with A c X.\n\nBaumgartner proved that if 2`0 = X, then even P*(con) holds for all n < w . Problem 38 . S . Hechler [18] proved THEOREM . If C .H . is true then 38JÁ is false even if f (x) is a sequence with the only limit point x for every x e R . 38/A is independent from ZFC + 2'~a > fit, . If MA is true then 38/C is false even if f (x) is of measure 0 for x c R . Problem 40. Of course MA implies a positive answer . We do not know if the negation is consistent.\n\nADDED IN PROOF. Baumgartner and Laver proved using iterated Sacks forcing that the negation of Problem 40 is consistent with 2`1) _ X 2 .\n\nProblem 42 . (C) A well-known result of Jensen states that in L there is a stationary subset B of a)-limits less than co z such that every section of B is nonstationary . This implies that (C) holds in L .\n\nProblem 46 . The answer is yes . This problem is relevant to the following problem of W . Taylor [28] .\n\nTaylor's problem. Let b be a cardinal . Let m(b) be the minimal cardinal having the following property . For every graph G of chromatic number ?_ m(b) and for every n, there is a graph G n of chromatic number ? n, such that G' G n , jG'j < b implies that G' is isomorphic to a subgraph of G . Is it true that m(N,) = H l ? (The existence of m(b) is obvious for every b .)\n\nA negative answer to Problem 46 would have shown m(N,) > X 1 . We still have a number of special classes of finite graphs for which we can prove the result for K2-chromatic graphs, but not for >_ X,-chromatic graphs . Problem 47. The following is a finite version of the problem . Let 0 < k < co, and let W be a graph of chromatic number > k ; N = {i < there is a circuit of length i contained in 9} . Is it true that\n\nProblem 54 . Folkman's paper appeared in [11] . A positive answer to Problem 54 would be implied by the following . There is an order type (D for which\n\nGraham and Spencer proved (23,5) vT,, k IX Hw+i K,] xw for n < w\n\nHere only (A) seems to be a genuine problem . The rest of the problems not covered by the above remark are of the same type . Problem 58 . A solution is published in [12] . Problems 59, 60, 61 . Yes . See the remarks in [6] . We mention that R . Solovay pointed out to us, in the theorem of Hajnal, (Q + ) --> G)'r' <' [6, p . 42], if a normal measure is given on a, the homogeneous set can be shown to be of measure 1 .\n\nProblem 62 . Note that we do not even know the answer if r = 3 and we change the requirement (2) to (2\") S' c S, IS'I = K, implies that there is Si -S, I Sil = 4, [Si ] 3 -Ti for i < 2 . Problem 63 . In the remark before the problem there is a misprint . We mean b < K o in the equivalence (1) . For b = X, this is false since m+-> (K,) 2 holds for every m while (K o , K,) \"' \" (K o , K,) is trivial . We remark that we do not know if there is an m for which (m, K,) x (K,, K,) holds . Problem 65 . The answer is yes . It follows from (~2) (w2)z' 1 . See [2] . Problem 66 . For the proof for p < w + 1 see [8] . Problem 67 . Yes (Laver) . He also proved THEOREM (LAVER) . Assume T+-* (?) )'s o . Then there is n < m such that Problem 69 . Erdős proved that the complement of a Suslin tree yields a negative answer even if we assume that in everyg'g, Ig'J = K, there is g\" -g', Ig\"I = 2 such that all but K o vertices are adjacent to at least one of them . With this stronger assumption it follows that 9 at least contains a complete [K,, X,] .\n\nProblem 71 . For Shelah's results see [24] . We state some instances of his theorems . (C) Assume JAI = Ka+i , J~ > KQ+i . Then there exists a sequence of type oo~ + 1 which is strongly cut either by or by the family of complements.\n\nShelah asks the following problem . Assume G .C .H . and K,, is regular, I A I = K a , a. > 0, IF 1 = N,,, . Does there exist a sequence of power K,, strongly cut either by or by the family of the complements? By the result of Prikry mentioned after Problem 8 it is consistent that this is false .\n\nProblem 72 . It is easy to see that a Suslin tree yields a counterexample . Problem 73 . The answer is yes . The easy proof will be given in a forthcoming joint paper of ours .\n\nProblem 74 . Shelah [25] proved that the answer is affirmative for every singular strong limit cardinal in place of K,,, .\n\nProblem 75 . Shelah remarked that a positive answer to Problem 75 would imply that every uniform ultrafilter on K u, is N, descendingly incomplete . Problem 77,/A . Jensen pointed out to us that the answer is negative in L . Problem 78 .\n\nCon(ZFC + 2 H o = X l -1-2 -4 1 = anything reasonable + there is a hereditarily separable subspace R of power 2 11, of 2\") .\n\nHere 2\" denotes the topological product of X l discrete spaces of 2 elements and hereditarily separable means that every subspace R' of R contains a denumerable dense subset .\n\nLet 6(R) _ 1{U -R : U is open} . It is an easy corollary of the above result that there is a (very good) Hausdorff space R with or(R) > 2xo such that or(R) is not of the form mx 1 .\n\nOne can conjecture that the following is true (in ZFC) : a(R)Ko = 6(R) for every infinite Hausdorff space .\n\nProblem 79 .\n\nTHEOREM (HAJNAL-JUHASZ) . Con(ZF) Con(ZFC -1-G .C .H . + there is a completely regular, hereditarily LindeMf topological space R, JR1 = X l , such that every countable subspace is closed discrete in R, and every uncountable subspace has weight X 2) .\n\nBoth theorems are generalizations of the Prikry result mentioned on p . 272 . Problem 80 . The problem should have been asked in the form whether a system A,,, exists for ~ < E A, for a stationary subset A of kl(a) . THEOREM (HAJNAL [17]) . The answer is affirmative if a is weakly inaccessible and not w-weakly Mahlo, or a is strongly inaccessible and not a)-strongly Mahlo . It also follows from the result of [17] and from a well-known result of Jensen that if V = L, the answer is affirmative iff a is not weakly compact . A variant of the problem : Let (S, -<) be an ordered set, A = X 2 . Assume S does not contain increasingly or decreasingly well-ordered subsets of type o .)2 .\n\nDoes then there exist Z -S, IZI = K, such that Z does not contain increasingly or decreasingly well-ordered subsets of type w, ?\n\nThis obviously is a \"Kurepa-Chang conjecture\" type problem . ADDED IN PROOF . Devlin proved that the answer is no, provided V = L .\n\nProblem II . Let JSJ = K, . Does there exist a 2-partition I of length 2 of S (i .e . [S] 2 = Ia U I,) such that I establishes I'll ;-) (XI)2i but for every Z c S . IZI _ X, and for i < 2 there are A, B -Z, JAS _ JBI = K, KIM [A, B] c Iz ? ADDED IN PROOF . Both Galvin and Shelah pointed out to us that the answer is obviously yes . See [13] .\n\nThe following should be read knowing the remarks given on pp . 271-274 concerning Problems 10-13 . THEOREM (HAJNAL) . Let K = Q(a+), a ? X, Assume fi --> (x)Z-. Then This is an easy Galvin type generalization of the Erdös-Rado Theorem . Let us now assume G .C .H ., a = X, We do not know if one can prove the possible generalizations of co t , ( co, + 1)K a mentioned on p . 272 . E .g . does fi (w,)Z xa imply fi , (w, + n) 2 for k, n < w ? We make the following DEFINITION I . Let a, b,,, v < 0(c), be cardinals or order types, and c, r cardinals . Assume that each b,, is a cardinal if a is a cardinal .\n\nWe write a (b,)e if the following statement is true . Let S be a set if a is a cardinal and let (S, <) be an ordered set if a is an order type such that ISI = a or typ S( <) = a respectively .\n\nLet J, :v < Q(c)) be an r-partition of type c of S . Then there exist v < ~2(c), e, d, and a subset S' -S such that (i) BSI = e or typ S( <) = e respectively . (ü) e --* (d, b,,)r but b, (d, b,)r .\n\n(iii) For all X -S', IXI = d (typ X( <) = d) [X] r n I,, 54 0 .\n\nIt is obvious that (i), (ü), (iii) imply that there is S\" -S, IS\"I = by (typ S\"( <) _ b v) with [S \" ]r -I,, . Hence a ) (b,.)r, implies a (b v), . We might say that a -R (b,), says that a (b,), holds as a consequence of a partition relation for two classes .\n\nWe did not investigate the general problem very closely but the following special case seems to be interesting . Problem III. Assume G .C .H . Does then X2 go hold? We formulate this special case without using the general notation .\n\n(1) Assume A = X2 . Let [S] 2 = U ., I\" be arbitrary . Does then there exist n < w, S' c S such that Note, that as a generalization of Theorem ( 1), (0) holds with = 0 for every a . For a = 1, fl _ 1, we think that a negative answer will be consistent .\n\nFor a = 2, # = 1, we have no guess . We now list some questions concerning the case ISI = X,, not covered by the given theorems . Some of them might be quite easy to answer . Problem X . We have no counterexample to the following : (1) Assume (Z, f ) -( R, I,) (where (R, Io ) is the Síerpinski partition defined in Theorem (5) and JZ{ < X o (or even IZ{ < X a) . Is it true then that (Z, f) (S, I) holds for every (S, I) establishing X,+-> ([X\" X,]) 2 9\n\n(2) Give the characterization of Theorem (4) assuming S .H . (The characterization is different because of Theorem (2) .)\n\n(3) Assume -iS .H . Give a characterization of countable structures (Z, ~) TV (S, I) for all (S, I) establishing X,+-> (X,)2 .\n\nK 2 +? (K 2 , 3) 2 ."
