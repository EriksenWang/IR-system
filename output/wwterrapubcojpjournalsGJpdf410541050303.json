    "abstract": "The cored sediments sampled by R/V Marion Dufrense are mostly muds consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, illite, chlorite + kaolinite and calcite. Authigenic carbonates mainly composed of aragonite, calcite, dolomite and associated with Fe-montmorillonite and pyrite occur in core samples collected from station MD-052911 (22°15.6′ N, 119°51.0′ E) at 2137-2140 cm and 2237-2240 cm depth which may be formed via sulfate reduction by CH 4 . In general Illite/Quartz intensity ratios of the sediments show little variation with core depth indicating the relatively constant abundance of illite in the source rock on Taiwan. The cored sediments have higher average Al 2 O 3 , ∑FeO and MgO but lower SiO 2 , Na 2 O, and CaO contents when compared with upper continental crust (UCC). High field strength elements (Zr, Hf, Y, Nb and Ta) are also depleted in the cored sediments. CaO, Sr, Mn and Pb in the core samples collected from station MD-052912 (22°21.5′ N, 119°48.5′ E) tend to decrease with depth which may be essentially related to the decrease of biogenic CaCO 3 with core depth. The La/Th, La/Sc, Th/Sc ratios of the cored sediments are similar to those of UCC, however the (La/Yb) N ratios of the cored sediments are higher. The cored sediments display similar REE patterns with LREE enrichment and negative Eu anomaly reflecting a felsic nature of the source rock which can also be identified in the La-Th-Sc plot. The chemistry of the sediments can be deduced using a mixing model involved four end members i.e., shale, greywacke, quartzite and limestone.",
    "full_text": "Taiwan Island located at the junction of the Ryukyu and Luzon Arcs in the northwestern Pacific, was formed by the oblique collision between the Luzon Arc and the Chinese continental margin in Late Cenozoic about 5 Ma (Biq, 1997;Suppe, 1981;Ho, 1988). South of Taiwan, the South China Sea lithosphere is subducting eastward under the Luzon arc. East of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate is subducting northward under the Ryukyu arc. Liu et al. (1997) concluded that the structural grain of the Taiwan mountain belt trends NNE-SSW, forming an arc convex toward the Asian continent. The orogenic structural features are well demonstrated by a series of stacked folds and thrust sheets verging west (Ho, 1982) on Taiwan. These orogenic structural features are believed to extend southward to offshore southwestern Taiwan (e.g., Letouzey and Sage, 1988;Liu et al., 1997). (1984) concluded that the collision, flipping and backarc spreading have been propagating along the continental margin at essentially identical rates since the late Pliocene. The active and relict accretionary wedges on both sides of Luzon are interpreted as resulting from two changes in the direction of subduction by the Luzon arc (Bowin et al., 1978).\n\nTectonically, south of 23°N, including Southern Taiwan and offshore areas are considered in the incipient collision zone. The Pingtung Plain of Taiwan and the Kaoping shelf and slope region are subjected to contraction due to collision between the Luzon arc and the Chinese margin indicated by west-vergent thrust faults and folds. On the other hand, rift-extension dominates in the Chinese margin immediately west of the Kaoping slope as evidenced by the absence of flexural extension normal faults in the Pliocene-Quaternary sediments (Yu and Huang, 2006).\n\nThe rock sequence of Taiwan Island is readily divisible into a pre-Tertiary basement and Cenozoic cover more than 10 km thick. The basement outcrops in the form of a 240-km-long inlier on the eastern flank of the Central Range, and consists mainly of a schist-marble complex with minor amounts of ortho-and paragneisses and amphibolites. The Cenozoic sequence covering the basement can be divided into a Central Range Group and a Foothill Zone Group. The former group is a succession principally of slate and phyllite with subordinate quartzite exposed mainly on the crest and west flank of the Central Range, while the latter group is a late Tertiary and Quaternary record of recurrent marine transgressions and regressions consisting of a marine sandstone-shalemudstone sequence interrupted by three Miocene coalbearing formations.\n\nThe cover succession of western Taiwan is in the form of a prism tapering westward from 8000 m thick in the Foothill Zone, thinning rapidly to only 500 m on the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait (Biq et al., 1985). Previous studies (Covey, 1984;Yu and Chou, 2001;Lin and Watts, 2002) suggested that the foreland basin west of the Taiwan mountain belt was formed during Pliocene as the flexural response to the loading of the Taiwan  (Lee, 1987).\n\norogen on the edge of the eastern Chinese margin.\n\nPliocene-Quaternary sediments more than 5000 m thick derived from the Taiwan orogen have filled the foreland basin (Yu and Chou, 2001). The foreland basin west of Taiwan formed earlier in northern Taiwan and then propagated southward along the spike of the Taiwan orogen, resulting in a mature foredeep in the north and a youthful one in the south (Covey, 1984;Brusset et al., 1999;Chiang et al., 2004).\n\nThe study area is located on the continental slope west of the Kaoping Canyon (Fig. 1) where an active accretionary wedge containing a widely distributed bottom simulating reflector exists. The wide occurrence of BSR together with venting phenomena observed by deep-sea camera using WHOI's TowCam system in October 2005 (Lin, 2006, personal communication) strongly indicate the occurrence of gas hydrates in the study area. High CH 4 contents were found in the pore gas of the obtained core samples in this area which generally increase with core depth (Chuang et al., 2006). The δ 13 C of CH 4 gases range from -54.4 to -95.0‰ and the δ 13 C of CO 2 ranges from -11.6~-29.9‰ (Chuang et al., 2006), indicating that an organic gas source predominates at shallower depth; however some thermogenic gases may be introduced from deeper sources. The δ 13 C of the authigenic carbonates from the core samples collected in this area is between -47‰ to -55‰, indicating the influence of CH 4 (Huang et al., 2006) which is significantly different from the biogenic carbonates found in the same core. In addition, the correlation plot of δ 13 B vs. Cl/B indicates that boron in the pore waters is strongly influenced by desorption of exchangeable boron while bottom water boron is affected by a unknown mechanism which may be related to the presence of gas hydrate (Chao and You, 2006). It should be noted that Lin et al. (2006) concluded that sulfate showed various degree of depletion in the study area with rapid depletion as shallow as about 2 meters below the sediment/water interface.\n\nThe sediments were sampled by the giant corer \"Calypso\" on board R/V Marion Dufrense of the French Polar Research Institute in May, 2005. Cored samples obtained at three stations i.e., MD-052911, MD-052912 and MD-052913 were analyzed in this study. The basic data for the sampling stations including longitude, latitude, water depth, core length and the general descriptions of the cores are given in Table 1.\n\nMineral identification of bulk sediments was carried out by X-ray diffraction on a Philips PW 1830 X-ray diffractometer with Cu radiation and Ni filter. Sediment samples were washed three times with distilled water by a centrifuge to remove sea water and dried in the oven at\n\nStation Core recovery (cm) Latitude Longitude Water depth (m) Description MD052911 2389 22°15.617′ N 119°51.079′ E 1076 Mostly homogeneous grey mud, locally with foram and shell debris, carbon-bearing materials occur below 1000 cm, authigenic carbonates occur at 2100-2200 cm and 2250-2300 cm which contain aragonite, calcite, dolomite, Fe-montmorillonite and pyrite, also with Pogonophora which live in a reducing environment. MD052912 3044 22°21.500′ N 119°48.500′ E 1093 Mostly homogeneous grey mud, locally carbon-bearing materials occur (2050-2100 cm). Compaction seems to be stronger below 1000 cm. MD052913 1268 22°09.156′ N 119°59.284′ E 1095 Mostly homogeneous grey mud, carbon-bearing materials occur at 2050-2100 cm.\n\nTable 1. General description of the cores The precision for all ICP-MS analyses is estimated better than ±5% of the amounts present, based on replicate analyses of BCR-1. SiO 2 was analyzed by NaOH fusion of sam-ple powers followed by ammonium molybdate colorimetry (Shapiro and Brannock, 1962) using a Shimadzu UV1201 spectrophotometer. Replicate analyses of U.S.G.S. standard rock BCR-1 indicated the precision for SiO 2 analysis is better than ±1.5% of the amounts present.\n\nThe cored sediments are mostly muds with >4 phi fractions averaging 97% of the total sediments. Mud content shows little variation with core depths. Major minerals of bulk sediments identified by XRD include quartz, feldspar, illite, chlorite + kaolinite and calcite. In core MD-052911 Feldspar/Quartz intensity ratios are high at certain depths (Fig. 2) which may be related to the mineral components of the source rocks during deposition. In core MD-052912 Calcite/Quartz intensity ratios tend to decrease with core depth due to the decrease of biogenic debris with core depth (Fig. 2).\n\nSpecial effort was made to search for authigenic carbonates by visual and petrographic investigation because distinct δC 13 values (-47~-55‰) of bulk carbonates had been found which implied sulfate reduction by methane which could be derived from gas hydrate (Huang et al., 2006). Authigenic carbonates were found at 2137-2140 cm and 2237-2240 cm depths in core MD-052911; both showed high Calcite/Quartz intensity ratios (Fig. 2c). XRD analysis indicates that the authigenic carbonates contain essentially aragonite, calcite, dolomite and are associated with Fe-montmorillonite and pyrite. On the other hand, in some core samples the high Calcite/Quartz ratios are related to biogenic debris such as foraminifera, for example at 1000 cm and 1500 cm of core MD-052911. The biogenic carbonates in MD-052911 generally have δC 13 about -2‰ to -3‰ (Huang et al., 2006) which are much heavier than the authigenic carbonate found in the Fig. 3. Average major element contents of the cored sediments normalized to upper continental crust (Taylor and McLennan, 1985). Fig. 5. Trace element contents of the cored sediments normalized to upper continental crust (Taylor and McLennan, 1985).   (Sun and McDonough, 1989).\n\nsame core. The clay minerals in the mudstones widely distributed in southern Taiwan generally comprise 60~65% illite, 20~30% chlorite and minor to 15% kaolinite of the total clay minerals (Chen, 1973;Chen et al., 2004). Montmorillornite occurs in trace amounts. A similar clay mineral assemblage was found in the Taiwan Strait shelf sediments (Chen, 1973). In general Illite/Quartz intensity ratios show limited variations with core depth (Fig. 2), indicating relative constant I/Q ratios in the source rocks, however this ratio is high at 1500 cm depth in core MD-052911.\n\nAuthigenic pyrites are commonly found in the cored sediments (Horng et al., 2004). They can fill into the foraminiferal chambers or replace parts of molluscan shells. In addition, authigenic pyrites can form elongated tubes 2~3 cm long and 0.2~0.3 cm wide which are porous in the center (Huang et al., 2006). Pyrite tubes with similar morphology and size rage were also found in the Hydrate Ridge of the Cascadian margin off Oregon where\n\nTable 2. (continued). (A) MD-052911.

It is clear that the cored sediments have higher ∑FeO and TiO 2 , but lower SiO 2 , CaO, Na 2 O, MnO and similar K 2 O contents when compared with UCC. The relatively higher CaO found in MD-052911 cored sediments (compared with MD-052912 and MD-052913) may be due to the occurrence of biogenic debris and authigenic carbonates.\n\nFigure 4 shows the CaO, Sr, Mn, and Pb of the cored sediments tend to decrease with core depths which may be essentially related to the decrease of biogenic CaCO 3 with core depth at MD052912 since Sr, Mn and Pb may  (Sun and McDonough, 1989).\n\nSiO 2 (wt%) 59.38 59.53 59.42 59.20 51.47 60.64 61.07 57.4 Al 2 O 3 16.27 15.76 15.81 16.15 12.66 15.12 15.82 16.7 ∑FeO 5.79 6.13 6.19 6.06 5.23 5.54 5.85 6.2 MgO 2.21 2.56 2.57 2.55 2.66 2.20 2.21 2.5 CaO 3.78 3.23 3.00 3.06 11.07 4.85 4.00 4.2 Na 2 O 1.99 1.91 1.93 1.90 1.43 1.67 1.63 2.0 K 2 O 3.21 3.24 3.25 3.31 2.47 2.93 3.16 3.3 MnO 0.050 0.063 0.064 0.060 0.043 0.049 0.054 0.058 TiO 2 0.59 0.57 0.56 0.56 0.49 0.56 0.56 0.6 P 2 O 5 0.17 0.13 0.16 0.13 0.11 0.11 0.06 0.2 L.O.I. 7.81 7.76 7.60 7.30 12.01 7.08 6.23 7.5 Total 101.234 41.35 41.14 41.08 48.18 40.10 39.57 100.580 Ba (ppm) 453 479 474 475 325 379 450 458 Co 14.3 16.7 16.4 16.1 12.4 13.4 14.6 15.3 Cr 87 88 91 92 70 82 76 91 Cs 11.8 12.7 12.8 13.0 9.9 11.6 13.0 12.1 Hf 1.76 2.59 2.30 2.40 1.63 1.97 1.82 2.12 Li 73 73 75 78 60 68 76 75 Nb 16.8 16.5 15.8 16.6 11.3 16.4 15.2 18.2 Ni 38.4 41.8 41.9 42.9 33.2 35.9 38.8 40.3 Pb 21.3 25.5 24.8 25.0 17.8 21.8 24.7 22.8 Rb 155 161 162 164 106 147 161 158 Sc 14.9 14.7 15.2 15.4 12.1 13.8 14.8 15.4 Sr 197 160 159 161 322 226 206 197 Ta 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 0.9 1.1 1.0 1.1 Th 13.2 14.9 14.4 14.8 11.1 13.3 13.7 14.0 U 2.41 2.41 2.35 2.73 9.94 6.45 2.96 2.98 V 117 117 117 117 100 109 116 121 Y 16.4 21.2 20.1 20.3 14.6 16.7 16.6 18.8 Zn 85 87 88 89 68 81 91 89 Zr 66 89 81 82 60 68 65 78 La 35.4 35.3 34.7 35.0 28.2 34.5 34.1 37.3 Ce 66.6 67.7 66.5 67.7 54.6 66.2 65.8 69.7 Nd 31.0 32.2 32.0 32.4 25.7 31.2 31.0 31.9 Sm 5.7 6.0 5.9 5.9 4.6 5.7 5.7 5.8 Eu 1.06 1.13 1.10 1.11 0.85 1.05 1.06 1.09 Gd 4.16 4.74 4.70 4.74 3.44 4.28 4.23 4.47 Tb 0.52 0.64 0.63 0.63 0.46 0.54 0.54 0.58 Yb 1.75 2.26 2.15 2.22 1.56 1.79 1.78 1.96 Lu 0.21 0.27 0.26 0.27 0.19 0.22 0.21 0.24 Eu/Eu* 0.66 0.65 0.64 0.64 0.65 0.65 0.66 0.65 (La/Yb) N 14.5 11.2 11.6 11.3 12.9 13.8 13.8 13.6\n\nreplace Ca site in the crystal lattice (Li, 2000). For MD-052911 and MD-052913 no regular chemical variation trends were found with core depth (variation diagrams are not shown here).\n\nThe high field strength elements (Zr, Hf, Y, Nb, and Ta) are relatively depleted in the cored sediments (Fig. 5) when compared to UCC (Taylor and McLennan, 1985) which may be related to the abundance of heavy minerals such as rutile and zircon. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the cored sediments are shown in Fig. 6. It is apparent that these sediments have similar patterns with light REE enrichment and negative Eu anomaly. The Eu anomaly may reflect the nature of the source rock (McLennan and Taylor, 1991;Awwiller, 1994;Lee, 2002). The (La/Yb) N and Eu anomaly variations with core depth are shown in Fig. 7. Generally no regular variation trend was found, except that (La/Yb) N ratios tend to increase slightly with core depths at station MD-052912 which may be due to the occurrence of minor montmorillorite at depth (Jiang et al., 2006). The ∑REE contents of the cored sediments are higher than UCC (Table 2). The average (La/Yb) N ratios of the sediments from MD052911, MD052912 and MD052913 ranging from 13.61 to 14.62 (Table 3), are generally higher than the ratio of UCC (9.2). Based on the (La/Yb) N ratio and the negative Eu anomaly it is suggested that the source rocks of the cored sediments may be felsic (Cullers and Graf, 1983;Cullers, 1995). The average La/Sc, La/Th and Th/Sc ratios of the cored sediments are listed in Table 3.\n\nThe corresponding ratios of UCC are also listed for comparison. It is clear that these ratios are similar to UCC. Cullers (1994) and Nyakairu and Koeberl (2001) suggested that the variations of La-Th-Sc can be used to distinguish the source rocks for the sediments. In Fig. 8 it is clear that the cored sediments generally fall within the field of mixed sources close to the felsic end member (E in Fig. 8).\n\nIn the (K 2 O/Na 2 O) vs. SiO 2 plots (Fig. 9) the cored sediments fall within the active continental margin field which is concordant with the conclusion reached by Yu and Song (1993). It is clear that the variation field of the cored sediments shown in Fig. 9 is different from the northern Taiwan Strait shelf sediments (Chao and Chen, 2003) deposited in a passive margin environment defined by Roser and Korsch (1986). The northern Taiwan Strait shelf sediments are SiO 2 rich generally ranging from 70% to 89% but they are Al 2 O 3 poor varying from 4.3 to 12.0%. The MgO, ∑FeO, CaO, Na 2 O and K 2 O contents in the northern Taiwan Strait shelf sediments are also lower than those found in the cored sediments analyzed in the present study. The La/Th ratios of the northern Taiwan Strait shelf sediments vary from 2.8 to 4.8 which are higher than those found in the cored sediments of the present study (Table 3). The La/Sc ratios of the northern Taiwan Strait shelf sediments ranging from 3.2 to 3.9 are also higher than those found in the cored sediments of the present study (Table 3).

As mentioned above, the Foothill Zone of Taiwan consists mainly of sandstone, shale and mudstone with minor amounts of limestone which are the potential source rocks for the cored sediments. Since detailed chemical compositions of these potential source rocks are not available at present, we select four end members i.e., shale, greywacke, quartzite and limestone (Table 5) from the literature (Govindaraju, 1989;Condie, 1993;Meisel et al., 1990) to deduce the percentage of contributions of different source rocks using a mixing model designed by Ho and Chen (1996).\n\nThe computer model was designed to use all constituting elements to find out the percentages of contribution of each end member by linear regression analysis based on the following equation:  (Sun and McDonough, 1989).\n\nAvg.\n\nSiO 2 (wt%) 59.10 60.26 59.66 57.95 58.50 63.95 60.14 57.51 Al 2 O 3 17.33 17.08 18.32 17.69 17.73 15.36 17.20 17.61 ∑FeO 6.10 6.42 6.15 7.14 6.22 5.71 6.17 6.56 MgO 2.33 2.29 2.26 2.21 2.35 2.03 2.24 2.57 CaO 2.63 2.30 1.96 2.66 3.19 2.12 2.53 3.06 Na 2 O 2.14 1.98 2.11 2.01 2.07 1.75 2.02 2.08 K 2 O 3.31 3.28 3.62 3.43 3.40 2.96 3.33 3.49 MnO 0.051 0.058 0.053 0.053 0.056 0.052 0.050 0.063 TiO 2 0.88 0.87 0.67 0.65 0.67 0.60 0.65 0.78 P 2 O 5 0.18 0.16 0.19 0.17 0.16 0.09 0.25 0.19 L.O.I. 6.34 5.89 5.80 5.76 6.90 5.94 6.26 6.60 Total 100.383 100.587 100.786 99.738 101.240 100.554 100.851 100.516 Ba (ppm) 472 461 485 466 464 431 451 496 Co 15.5 15.9 15.8 15.9 15.6 14.1 15.9 16.5 Cr 92 90 97 96 97 83 95 94 Cs 11.5 11.4 13.1 12.5 11.7 10.9 11.6 12.6 Hf 2.30 2.33 1.74 2.22 2.45 2.36 2.21 2.18 Li 73 73 79 79 78 70 76 76 Nb 18.8 18.9 21.5 20.9 21.0 18.0 20.2 18.7 Ni 40.0 40.7 41.0 39.9 41.4 37.9 39.9 42.5 Pb 23.3 23.2 26.2 23.9 22.4 21.3 21.4 26.6 Rb 155 152 172 163 160 147 156 164 Sc 17.0 16.7 16.0 15.7 15.8 13.9 15.3 16.7 Sr 164 153 146 164 180 145 156 169 Ta 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.1 Th 15.1 14.8 14.6 14.6 14.9 14.3 14.1 14.8 U 3.24 3.04 2.12 2.38 2.73 2.66 2.43 2.67 V 128 125 128 126 127 109 123 129 Y 20.2 20.0 16.9 18.7 20.4 18.3 18.7 19.7 Zn 100 95 95 91 95 81 77 101 Zr 90 90 68 83 93 81 85 85 La 43.1 43.0 41.6 41.5 42.5 37.5 40.7 40.5 Ce 84.9 86.4 79.8 82.0 87.6 71.7 81.2 79.8 Nd 34.7 34.8 33.8 33.5 34.1 34.2 33.4 33.9 Sm 6.3 6.5 6.1 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.1 6.3 Eu 1.16 1.15 1.13 1.14 1.16 1.14 1.14 1.12 Gd 4.78 4.90 4.44 4.61 4.82 4.76 4.70 4.80 Tb 0.64 0.65 0.58 0.60 0.61 0.61 0.59 0.65 Yb 2.01 2.05 1.73 2.00 2.10 1.99 1.97 2.03 Lu 0.26 0.26 0.22 0.25 0.26 0.24 0.24 0.26 Eu/Eu* 0.64 0.62 0.66 0.66 0.65 0.63 0.65 0.63 (La/Yb) N 15.3 15.0 17.2 14.9 14.5 13.6 14.8 14.3 S A B C D\n\nWhere S represents elemental concentration of each sample;  (Sun and McDonough, 1989).

It should be mentioned that a single mixing event involving various end members may reach a similar final composition as a polycycling process. For example a polycycling process involving four end members (i.e., shale, greywacke, quartzite and limestone) may generate final sediments which have bulk chemistry similar to those sediments produced by a single mixing event involving these four end members but with different percentages of contributions based on the following assumption:\n\nMD052911 MD052912 MD052913 UCC La/Th 2.66 2.73 2.56 2.80 La/Sc 2.43 2.43 2.37 2.73 Th/Sc 0.91 0.89 0.93 0.97 (La/Yb) N 13.6 14.3 14.6 9.2\n\nTable 3.

The Taiwan strait shelf sediments (Chao and Chen, 2003) are also plotted for comparison. Shale after Govindaraju (1989), greywacke after Condie (1993), quartzite after Meisel et al. (1990), limestone after Govindaraju (1989), mudstone (Erhjenchi) after Chang (1996). Fig. 9. K 2 O/Na 2 O vs. SiO 2 plots for the cored sediments (variation field after Roser and Korsch, 1986). Taiwan Strait shelf sediments from Chao and Chen (2003); mudstone (Erhjenchi and Tzengwenchi) from SW Taiwan after Chang (1996); Fanshan sediments after Lee (1987).\n\nis acceptable. We fully understand that these calculations are not perfect since some data points are a little far away from the 45° slope line. The calculated results show P 2 O 5 , Nb and Ni deficiency but HREE and Zr enrichment, which may be related to the deficiency of apatite, Ti-bearing mineral and olivine and the surplus of zircon in the source rocks. It is clear that the percentages of contributions of these four end members to the cored sediments vary from core to core (Table 5). However, greywacke is the dominant contributor (45.18~61.12%) followed by shale (30.20~41.17%). It should be noted that the present model can not evaluate the variation of clay mineral proportions as related to the distance to Taiwan Island (Jiang et al., 2006), since various source rocks (end members) such as shale and greywacke may contain clay minerals although in different proportions.\n\nTable 4.

The high field strength elements (Zr, Hf, Y, Nb and Ta) are also depleted in the cored sediments when compared with UCC. The sediments display similar chondrite-normalized REE patterns with light REE enrichment [(La/Yb) N ranging from 13.61 to 14.62] and negative Eu anomaly reflecting the felsic nature of the source rocks.\n\nBased on the La-Th-Sc variations the source rocks are deduced to be of \"mixed origin\", close to the felsic end member. The chemistry of the cored sediments can be deduced by mixing models involving 4 end members i.e., shale, greywacke, quartzite and limestone.\n\nThe cored sediments are mostly muds consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, illite chlorite + kaolimite and calcite. In MD-052912 sediments the Calcite/Quartz intensity ratios tend to decrease with core depth due to the decrease of biogenic debris with core depth. Authigenic carbonates consisting mainly of aragonite, calcite and dolomite associated with Fe-montmorillonite and pyrite occur in core MD-052911 which may be formed via sulfate reduction by methane. In general Illite/Quartz intensity ratios of the sediments show limited variations with core depth which may be due to the relatively constant abundance of illite in the source rock on Taiwan. Authigenic pyrites are commonly found in the cored sediments and form small elongated tubes in some cases.\n\nEu/Eu* = Eu n /(Sm n * Gd n ) 1/2 .
