Table 13.2.1: ICD-10-AM codes ..............................................................................................\n\nThe Asian people in Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) are a culturally diverse group with each ethnic group having its own language, customs, traditions and health issues. The aim of this report was to produce a selective Health Needs Assessment (HNA) of the Asian population, including the differences and inequalities in health status between the main Asian ethnic groups living in CMDHB. The definition of 'Asian' used in this report was that developed by Statistics New Zealand and was limited by the data collection methods within the health services. The ethnic groups included were Chinese, Indian, 'Other Asian', 'All Asian' and European. In some instances comparisons were also made with Maaori and Pacific ethnic groups. For most rates, age-standardisation and confidence intervals were provided.\n\nThe Asian people in CMDHB have increased significantly over the last decade; over 18% of the total Counties Manukau (CM) population indicate some Asian ethnicity. Approximately 83,000 people living in CM in 2006 had some Asian ethnicity (ie 'total response' ethnicity), comprising 33,000 Indians, 32,000 Chinese and 18,000 'Other Asians'. Over 20% of all Asians in New Zealand live in CM. The total Asian population in CM is projected to grow by more than 90% over the next 20 years.\n\nThe Asian population is relatively young with a bimodal distribution; 41% being under 24 years age and 33% between 30-49 years age. Three quarters of the Asian people live in Howick, Pakuranga, Manukau and Papatoetoe suburbs of CM. Approximately 65% moved into CM from other regions of New Zealand and from overseas. Asian people are highly educated but with slightly lower incomes and higher unemployment rates compared to Europeans. They are evenly distributed across the deprivation deciles overall, but there were inequalities in socio-economic determinants among the different Asian ethnic groups.\n\nThe Asian population as a whole fared better than Europeans on many indicators including: life expectancy, avoidable mortality and hospitalisation, child health and women's health indicators. No differences were shown in some indicators and they fared worse in indicators such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk and protective factors (obesity, physical activity, and vegetable consumption), and health utilisation (primary care, cancer screening and Chronic Care Management (CCM) programmes in CM).\n\nxii There was immense diversity of health status within the Asian population. Major differences were found in health outcomes, risk factors and health service utilisation among Asian ethnic groups. Indians did worse than Chinese on many indicators, which would result in the problem of 'averaging' if the broad category 'Asian' was considered. 'Other Asians' were generally intermediate between Indian and Chinese, but it was difficult to comment on this group because of small numbers. Further, this ethnic group comprised of several small diverse communities and the pitfall of 'averaging' could not be avoided in this group.\n\nThe main areas of concern for Indians were high rates of newborns with low birth weight (LBW), obesity, diabetes (type 2), and cardiovascular disease. They had high adult and child potentially avoidable hospitalisation (PAH) rates for many conditions; high surgical intervention rates; low prevalence of accessing primary care despite high Primary Health Organisation (PHO) enrolment; increased prevalence of risk factors such as high cholesterol, blood pressure and obesity; decreased prevalence of protective factors such as physical activity and vegetable consumption; lower average age at first and all deliveries, high percentage of assisted deliveries including caesareans, high percentage of deliveries complicated by pre-eclampsia and diabetes; and high termination of pregnancy rates in private setting.\n\nThe Chinese population in general fared better than Europeans on many health indicators: life expectancy, avoidable mortality and hospitalisation, surgical intervention rates, child and women's health. Low primary care utilisation, low physical activity, particularly in women, low uptake of cervical and breast screening, gestational diabetes, and high rates of termination of pregnancy in private setting were the key issues identified in Chinese population.\n\nAlthough the Asian population as a whole fared better than Europeans in many health indicators, there were many inequalities between the Indian ethnic group and Europeans. No major differences were discerned for most of the health indicators analysed, between CM and 'All NZ' for both Asians and Europeans.\n\nThe Asian population has been the fastest growing ethnic group in CM and tremendous diversity exists with respect to health status, health risk and health service utilisation among different Asian ethnic groups.\n\nThe Asian population as a whole fared better than Europeans on many health indicators, particularly, life expectancy and avoidable mortality. However, there were many inequalities between Indians and Europeans. Indians had high utilisation of secondary health services, particularly in relation to diabetes and CVD but low utilisation of preventive and primary health services. Despite the low utilisation of health services, like primary care and cancer screening by the Chinese, their health was generally better than Indians and Europeans.\n\nThe inequalities between the Chinese and Indian population were often large, resulting in 'averaging' of the results when the 'Asian' broad category was considered. Recognising these differences and monitoring the health of Asian people at level 2 ethnicity would assist in identifying and improving their health needs.\n\nThe following recommendations were made to the Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) Chief Funding and Planning Officer:\n\nPriority should be given to reduce the health inequalities in Indians o A strategic approach is needed to address and reduce the high rates of low birth weight, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in this ethnic group o CMDHB's service development and health gain priority areas should also target Indian people in the interventions such as, Let's Beat Diabetes, Youth Health Plan, Chronic Diseases Plan, Primary Care Plan, Child Health Plan o Awareness of the above conditions and the risk factors should be raised in the Indian community through community organisations, PHO's and use of appropriate media o 'Lets Beat Diabetes' five year plan needs to acknowledge Indian as high risk group. Development of community leadership and action should be supported, to empower this community to slow the progression of diabetes o CCM Diabetes and CVD programmes should include Indians in their high risk groups and encourage their enrolment within the programmes o Look for interventions at community level that have been shown to be effective in addressing the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the Indian communities. CMDHB should advocate to include Indians as a priority group in the 'Healthy Eating -Healthy Action' (HEHA) Implementation Plan 2004-2010 2. Improve primary care access and preventive services for Chinese people o The advantage in health of Chinese people is likely to regress with acculturation and as the 'selection' effect wanes. Efforts should be made to monitor the health of this population, learn the positive aspects and encourage health promotion messages in a culturally appropriate manner o Information regarding health system in New Zealand, primary care and cancer screening should be disseminated in a culturally consist manner to improve access 3. Reliable data collection of Asian as an entire group and sub-group o Reliable data collection as entire group and sub groups is essential to better understand the diversity and particular health issues of this population. CMDHB should advocate for consistency in ethnicity classification at national, District Health Board (DHB), PHO and Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) level xiv o Data and information need to be gathered about best practices and lessons learned from health promotion activities and health interventions, particularly at the community level and disseminated widely 4. Future work and research o Further analysis of health indicators such as mental illness, cancer and infectious diseases, not addressed by this HNA should be conducted o Further research into effects of migration and differences between first and second generation Asians is required to understand the effects of acculturation and migrant needs o Further research is required at community and national level to understand the risk factors of CVD in Indians. Community engagement is necessary to design interventions to address these risk factors and for health promotion in a culturally appropriate manner\n\n• The HNA was planned over a short time frame of 4 months. It was difficult to obtain data for many health indicators in this time frame. Data on cancer, mental illness, accidents and infectious disease were not included.\n\n• Detailed ethnicity data was unavailable for Asians over many indicators such as, oral health, cervical screening, and mental health. The 2002/03 New Zealand health survey does not routinely analyse the Asian population at level 2 ethnicity. However, these findings were discussed in the Asian Health Chart Book at a national level and would have similar implications for the Asian people in CM.\n\n• Asians are a diverse group. Although sub-grouping has enabled researchers to make some meaningful conclusions for the Chinese and Indian people, even within these groups significant diversity exists -example Indian migrating from Fiji versus those from India versus those born in NZ. The 'Other Asian' -comprised of several small diverse communities also has the problem of 'averaging'. Furthermore, the relatively small numbers for this population can result in large confidence intervals and skewed data for many of the health indicators.\n\n• The indicators did not take into consideration the duration of residence in New Zealand. This will overlook the impacts of migration, acculturation and settlement on health status.\n\n• No community engagement was undertaken.\n\nxv\n\nThe Asian population as a whole were compared against Europeans and the findings grouped under: 'Fared worse (or more at risk) than Europeans', 'Fared better than Europeans' and 'Similar to Europeans 'sub headings. Findings were from CM and both genders unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n'Fared worse than Europeans'\n\n• Greater proportion of migrant population\n\n• Approximately 17% had English as language barrier • 5% unemployment rates against 3% in Europeans • High proportion with low incomes and low proportion with high incomes • Higher adult hospitalisation rates for angina and stroke • Higher adult hospitalisation rates for asthma and congestive cardiac failure (CCF) in 'All Asian' men • Higher intervention rates for cataract extraction • Lower percentage enrolled with CCM CVD programme • Lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening • Lower prevalence of primary care access and PHO enrolment • Lower prevalence of physical activity and recommended vegetable intake • Higher LBW, infant mortality rate (IMR) and child mortality (0-14 years) from all causes • Higher hospitalisation rates for gastroenteritis in boys and girls, for asthma in boys and for dental conditions in Asian girls • Higher gestational diabetes and higher termination of pregnancy rates in private sector 'Fared better than Europeans' • Higher life expectancy • Lower adult all cause mortality and mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD) • Lower adult potentially avoidable hospitalisation (PAH) rates overall, and particularly from cellulitis and pneumonia • Lower intervention rates for total hip replacement • Lower prevalence of smoking • Lower teenage deliveries and lower termination of pregnancy rates in public sector for women under 19 years age 'Similar to Europeans' • Distribution across the deprivation deciles, education, on benefit • Mortality for stroke and diabetes • Adult hospitalisations for myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes, chronic obstructive respiratory disease (CORD) and kidney/urinary infections • Intervention rates for angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), total knee replacement, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy and prostatectomy • Percentage of known diabetes enrolled with CCM diabetes programme • Child PAH from all causes, immunisation and Well Child coverage • Average age at all deliveries and first delivery, total fertility rate (TFR), caesarean sections, percentage of deliveries complicated by pre-eclampsia, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy prevalence xvi\n\nThe Indian ethnic group was compared with Chinese and the findings discussed under: 'Fared worse (or more at risk) than Chinese', 'Fared better than Chinese', and 'Similar to Chinese' sub headings. Findings were from CM and both genders unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n'Fared worse than Chinese'\n\n• Greater proportion of migrant population • Indians more represented in deprived areas and less in affluent areas • Lower life expectancy and higher adult PAM from all causes • Higher mortality for IHD in Indian men • Higher adult PAH from all causes, angina and chest pain, MI, diabetes, kidney/urinary infections, CHF, cellulitis, and asthma • Higher hospitalisation rates for respiratory infections and CORD in Indian men • Higher prevalence of diabetes in Indians (8.9%) compared to Chinese (2.6%) • Higher intervention rates for angioplasty, CABG, total knee replacement, cataract extraction, and hysterectomy • Lower percentage of Indians with MI in the last 12 months enrolled with CCM CVD programme • Higher prevalence of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity • Higher child PAH from all causes, gastroenteritis and asthma • Higher newborns with LBW • Low average age at first delivery and all deliveries • Higher caesarean section rate, deliveries complicated by pre-eclampsia • Higher pelvic inflammatory disease prevalence and termination of pregnancy rates in public sector 'Fared better than Chinese'\n\n• Approximately 22% of Chinese people had English as language barrier compared to 10% Indians • Low proportion with low incomes and high proportion with high incomes • Higher percentage of known diabetes enrolled with CCM diabetes programme • Higher prevalence of primary care access and PHO enrolment • More likely to be physically active, particularly Indian men • Lower teenage deliveries • Lower termination of pregnancy rates in private sector 'Similar to Chinese'\n\n• Unemployment, secondary school education and percentage on benefit • Adult PAM in women from all causes and IHD • Adult mortality from stroke and diabetes • Adult hospitalisation from stroke, CORD in women; asthma in men • Intervention rates for total hip replacement, cholecystectomy and prostatectomy • Recommended fruit and vegetable intake and breast screening • Smoking prevalence • Immunisation and Well Child coverage • Gestational diabetes and ectopic pregnancy prevalence\n\nAsians are the fastest growing ethnic group in New Zealand and make up almost 8.5% of the total population. This figure is expected to reach 15% of the national population by 2020 (1). The Asian population is diverse and increasing in the Counties Manukau DHB area. They make up the third largest ethnic group (18.2%) after Europeans and Pacific in CMDHB.\n\nThe New Zealand Health Strategy (2) requires District Health Boards (DHB) to conduct health needs assessment (HNA) of their local communities to reduce inequalities in health between ethnic groups and develop frameworks for implementing the national priorities. Health needs assessment is a systematic method for reviewing the health issues facing a population, leading to agreed priorities and resource allocation that will improve health and reduce inequalities (3).\n\nCMDHB has conducted HNA for the Maaori and Pacific populations in their region. The Asian population is the next group to be targeted for a HNA, to review the health issues faced by this population, assist in resource allocation decisions and services to improve their health, and reduce inequalities.\n\nThe definition of 'Asian' used in this report is based on the categories used in the census, developed by Statistics New Zealand in 1996 (SNZ) (4). This group is made up of people with origins in the Asian continent from Afghanistan in the west to Japan in the east and from China in the north to Indonesia in the south. A full listing of the classification can be found in Appendix 1. This is similar to the definition used by the Asian Health Chart Book 2006 (5). It excludes people originating from the Middle East (including Iran and Iraq), Central Asia (except Afghanistan) and Asian Russia. This definition of 'Asian' is unique to New Zealand and differs from many western countries such as the United Kingdom or Australia (6). In USA, Asian people have been often grouped with Pacific peoples as 'Asian/Pacific Islanders', although the most recent census 2000 separates the different Asian and Pacific groups (7). In UK, the term 'Asian' is more commonly associated with people of South Asian origin, particularly Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans (8). In Australia, the census definition is similar to New Zealand. However, it is often used to denote peoples from Southeast and East Asia.\n\nThere is increasing use of the SNZ definition of 'Asian' in the New Zealand health sector, particularly in all the major reports on Asian health in New Zealand available to date (5,(9)(10)(11). In contrast to the SNZ definition, colloquial use of the term 'Asian', as reflected in the media, often describes Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people, and excludes Indians and other peoples with origins in the Indian subcontinent (6,12).\n\nThere is limited information on the health status of Asian people in New Zealand. Prior to 1996, SNZ did not incorporate an 'Asian' ethnic category and Asians were included in the 'Other' category. However, the growing Asian population, particularly in Auckland and increasing concern regarding their health, has resulted in publication of a number of reports in the recent past.\n\n• Asian Public Health Project Report(10) • Asian Health in Aotearoa: An analysis of the 2002-2003 New Zealand Health Survey(13) • A Health Profile of Young Asian New Zealanders: Findings from Youth 2000 (a National Secondary School Youth Survey)(14) • Asian Health Chart Book 2006(5)\n\nThe key issues identified in these reports include: low birth weight, obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease among Indian people; low utilisation of health services, particularly by Chinese people; low levels of physical activity and mental health concerns, particularly in young people. These reports also concluded that recent or first-generation migrants do better than long-standing migrants or the New Zealand born across most health indicators. This positive health effect is largely a 'healthy migrant' effect (15) and is expected to abate over time (5).\n\nMost reports have focused on 'Asian' as a category or Indian and Chinese as subgroupings. The report 'Asian Health in Aotearoa' looked at ethnic sub-groups -Chinese, South-Asian, Korean and South-East Asians. These reports have shown similarities and diversity in health status among Asian peoples. Further, the reports have highlighted the drawbacks of 'averaging'. When the whole Asian ethnic group is considered, it obscures the prevalence of some diseases which certain ethnic groups are more prone to such as high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in people from the Indian subcontinent.\n\nInternationally, there is growing concern amongst health professionals and policy makers of increasing health inequalities in South Asians. In the UK, the mortality from CVD is 46% higher for men and 51% higher for women of South Asian origin than the general population (16). They are approximately 50% more likely to die prematurely than the general population (17).The increased susceptibility to CVD in South Asian migrants is well established not only in the UK, but also in South Africa, the United States, the Caribbean, Singapore and urban India (18). This disparity is increasing as the death rate from CVD is not falling as fast for South Asians as it is for the rest of the population. The incidence of type 2 diabetes in the UK is 6 times higher for South Asians than for white people (19), increasing the CVD risk in this population. The growing CVD epidemic has generated a lot of action in policy and health services to address the issue in this susceptible population.\n\nEthnicity is the ethnic group or groups that people identify with or feel they belong to. Ethnicity is a measure of cultural affiliation, as opposed to race, ancestry, nationality or citizenship (20). Ethnicity is self perceived and people can belong to more than one ethnic group. There are ethnicity data collection standards to maintain consistency in data collection from census and health and disability Sector.\n\nThe Statistics New Zealand Ethnicity Classification is a hierarchical structure with four levels (Appendix 1: Table 13.1.2 to 13.1.5). Individual ethnic group information are aggregated into progressively broader ethnic groups from level three-four to level one, according to geographic location or origin, or cultural similarities.\n\nChinese, Indian, Southeast Asian and Other Asian are the Asian categories at level 2 codes. All Asian ethnic groups can be aggregated under them. The Chinese and Indian communities are the two largest groups with long histories of settlement in New Zealand (21,22). The 'Other Asian' category includes several smaller Asian communities and risks the problem of averaging.\n\nThis report follows the same stratification as the Asian Health Chart Book -Chinese, Indian, and 'Other Asian'. However, 'All Asian' as a group is also analysed and compared with the Europeans. In some instances comparison is made also with Maaori and Pacific groups. This will enable the identification of the possible differences or similarities between the different Asian ethnic groups, the Asian group as a whole, and avoid the pitfall of averaging.\n\nThe sub-categories of East Asians, South Asians and Southeast Asians would have been ideal for stratification and would result in more meaningful comparisons. For example the South Asian category would include people from the Indian subcontinent -India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Fiji Indians. However, this was not possible as hospital data is not available at level 4 ethnicity. The 'Other Asian' category comprises of diverse Asian groups, varying widely in language, culture and health issues. These have been grouped under the one ethnic group rather than being completely excluded. This may result in skewed data because of the small numbers and may also be prone to the problems of averaging.\n\nThe high levels of CVD and diabetes in South Asians has future implications for planning and service provision by the health sector. In CM, the South Asian population is approximately 5% more than the Indian population (Census 2006, Usually Resident population). Therefore, assuming similar prevalence rates, for planning purposes one might increase the mortality, morbidity and health utilisation numbers in the Indian population by 5% to give approximate figures for the South Asian population.\n\nIt is also worth noting that even within the Chinese and Indian groups significant diversity exists -example Indian migrating from Fiji compared to those from India compared to those born in New Zealand.\n\nThe aim of this report was to produce a selective health needs assessment of the Asian population, including the differences and inequalities in health status between the different Asian ethnic groups living in CM at level 2 ethnicity.\n\n• To describe the demography of Asian population in CM • To identify any significant differences or inequalities in health status amongst the three Asian groups -Indian, Chinese and other Asian • To compare these differences, where possible with Pakeha, Pacific and Maaori populations • To Inform the CMDHB of the priority areas for intervention and service design, to improve Asian health and reduce any inequalities • To highlight potential areas for future research 3 Methodology\n\nThe selection of indicators was to inform regarding the health of Asian people, the socioeconomic determinants, risk factors, health outcomes, health service access and utilisation. Consideration was given to the identification of key issues in the Asian population, the similarities and differences amongst the different Asian subgroups, and comparison with the European population. Where possible, the indicators were aligned with those selected for health monitoring by the DHB and Ministry, at a national level.\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10-AM) has been used to code diseases/conditions for reporting mortality and hospitalisations. For the ICD-10-AM codes used, please refer to Appendix 2 (Table 13.2.1). This HNA was initially planned as a preliminary assessment to identify health concerns which could be followed by a more detailed assessment at a later stage if required. The availability of data at level 2 ethnicity has limited the analysis of many salient indicators that could affect health.\n\nData presented in this report was collated from multiple sources. The following table lists the data sources used for the indicators.\n\nTable 3.2.1: Data sources Data source Indicator Year Statistics New Zealand Census 2006 Demography, socioeconomic determinants, smoking prevalence for adults aged 15+ years 2006 New Zealand Health Information Service (NZHIS) Mortality collection Dataset National Minimum Dataset (NMDS) Mortality Hospitalisations 2001-2004 2004-2006 Kidslink -CMDHB Immunisation Well Child Check 2005 Chronic Care Management Database -CMDHB CCM diabetes programme CCM CVD programme 2006 2006 Breast screening -CMDHB Breast screening 2005-2007 Lets Beat Diabetes Survey Fruit and vegetable intake Physical activity Smoking prevalence for adults aged 16+ years Diabetes prevalence 2007 Epsom Day Unit Dataset Public termination of pregnancies 2004-2006 Auckland Medical Aid Centre Limited (AMAC) Dataset Private termination of pregnancies 2004-2006 Primary Care team -CMDHB Primary Health Organisation (PHO) enrolment 2006-2007 New Zealand Health Survey (NZHS) Risk and protective factors 2002-2003\n\nRates were calculated as the proportion of the population associated with the indicators compared to the population of interest. Rates were expressed per 100 (percent), per 1000 or per 100,000 (23). The denominators used for calculating the rates were derived from census population data for the same years as the numerator year.\n\nRates were not calculated for counts that were less than 5 (New Zealand Health Information Service data) or less than 10 (New Zealand Health Survey 2002/03 data). For most rates, age-standardisation and 95% confidence intervals were provided. Standardisation is a commonly used analytical technique for controlling confounding factors (such as the age dependency of mortality) when making comparisons between population groups and/or over time (24). This enables a valid comparison between populations with different size and age structures.\n\nCensus usually resident population (UR) is a count of all people who usually live in New Zealand, or in an area of New Zealand, and are present in New Zealand on a given census night. This excludes visitors from overseas and residents who are temporarily overseas on census night. Some of the Census data is analysed with UR data.\n\nCensus estimated resident population (ER) is an estimate of people who usually live in New Zealand, or in an area of New Zealand, at a given date. Adjustments are made to census night population counts to include residents who are missed or are temporarily overseas. Adjustments are also made for births, deaths and net migration of residents during the period between census night and the given date. The ER population is the best fit with health data and for health planning purposes, and is used throughout this report unless otherwise noted.\n\nConfidence intervals give an indication of the margin of error -95% confidence intervals were calculated where possible throughout the report. When the 95% CIs of two rates do not overlap, the difference in rates between the groups is statistically significant with 95% confidence. If the two confidence intervals do overlap any difference is more likely to be due to chance, and is generally considered to be not statistically significant (25).\n\nThe data in this HNA is presented with the aim and objectives in mind. The ethnic groups included were Chinese, Indian, 'Other Asian', 'All Asian' and European. In some instances, comparisons have been made with the Maaori and Pacific ethnic groups. CM data was compared with 'All NZ' data where possible. Most data was aggregated for 3 years (2004-2006) to increase the numbers and reliability. However, some data have been presented for the years available and mentioned in the table 3.2.1.\n\nThe indicators were presented with breakdown into gender, age and ethnicity as proved useful. Children have been defined as 0-14 years and adults as 15+ years of age. Within the child health data infants (0-1 year age) and the 0-4 year age group were also examined.\n\n'Total response' output was used to categorise ethnicity in most instances unless noted. The demography section shows the difference with the prioritised format (eg Table 4.1.1, page 77). 'Total response' records all ethnicity responses and results can exceed the total population if people have reported more than one ethnicity. This classification allows for the representation of all those people who identify with any group (24). In the 'prioritisation' classification, each respondent is assigned to a single ethnic group using the priority system, in the following order: Maaori, Pacific, Asian, European/Other group. The process ensures that the total number of responses equals the total population. However, the size of each ethnic group will be under-estimated with the exception of Maaori ethnic group (24). Although 'total response', does appear to overestimate population totals it does allow representation of all those people which identify with any given ethnic group.\n\n• The HNA was planned over a short time frame of 4 months. It was difficult to obtain data for many health indicators in this time frame. Data on cancer, mental illness, accidents and infectious disease were not included.\n\n• Detailed ethnicity data was unavailable for Asians over many indicators such as, oral health, cervical screening, and mental health. The 2002/03 New Zealand health survey does not routinely analyse the Asian population at level 2 ethnicity. However, these findings were discussed in the Asian Health Chart Book at a national level and would have similar implications for the Asian people in CM.\n\n• Asians are a diverse group. Although sub-grouping has enabled researchers to make some meaningful conclusions for the Chinese and Indian people, even within these groups significant diversity exists -example Indian migrating from Fiji versus those from India versus those born in NZ. The 'Other Asian' -comprised of several small diverse communities also has the problem of 'averaging'. Furthermore, the relatively small numbers for this population can result in large confidence intervals and skewed data for many of the health indicators.\n\n• The indicators did not take into consideration the duration of residence in New Zealand. This will overlook the impacts of migration, acculturation and settlement on health status.\n\n• No community engagement was undertaken.\n\nThis section presents data on the following:\n\n• Population characteristics, size and growth projections to 2026 by ethnic group\n\n• Age and gender structure of the Asian population in CM • Asian population in CM by NZ Dep2006 • Socioeconomic determinants of the Asian population All data presented were from the Census 2006. The data in this section uses 'estimated resident' population for demography and population projections, and 'usually resident' for socioeconomic determinants as noted. 'Total response' ethnicity classification had been used throughout this report to maintain consistency. However, 'prioritised' ethnicity numbers were also illustrated in the demography data for comparison purposes.\n\nThe Asian population in CM is increasing progressively. Approximately 20% of Asian people in New Zealand live in CM. They make up 9% of the population nationally and 16.1% of the CM population by prioritised ethnicity, the fourth largest ethnic grouping. However Asian forms the third largest ethnic group (at 18%) in CM when 'total response' is considered.\n\nTable 4.1-1 and 4.1-2 present population data for 'All Asian' and the ethnic subgroups at level 2 ethnicity, in CM in 2006. The ethnic populations at level 1 were compared with national data.\n\nTable 4.1.1: Asian ethnic group distribution in CM, 2006 census usually resident and estimated resident population Usually resident population Estimated resident population Total response Prioritised Total response Prioritised Chinese 28,100 25,600 31,900 29,300 Indian 29,700 28,600 33,800 32,800 Other Asian 15,900 15,500 17,600 11,200 All Asian 73,700 69,700 82,800 73,200 As % all CMDHB 18.2% 16.1% Table 4.1.2: Population by ethnicity, CM and New Zealand, 2006 census estimated resident, prioritised Counties Manukau All New Zealand Ethnicity Count Percent Count Percent Maaori 76,100 16.7 624,300 14.9 Pacific 87,100 19.1 226,900 6.1 Asian 73,200 16.1 356,000 8.5 European/Other 218,700 48.1 2,946,900 70.4 Total 455,100 100 4,154,100 100 Figure 4.1.1: Population demography, 2006 census estimated resident, prioritised CM New Zealand Maori 17% Pacific 19% Asian 16% European+ other 48% Maori 15% Pacific 6% Asian 9% European+ other 70% Figure 4.1.2 shows the different ethnic composition of Asian people in CM. The Indian community was the largest in CM (44.8%), followed by Chinese (40%), Southeast Asians (8%) and 'Other Asian' (7.2%), consisting of several small communities. According to Census 2006, nationally, the Chinese community was the largest, approximately 148,000 and comprising over 40% of the Asian ethnic grouping, while the Indian community numbers were approximately 105,000 (29% of the grouping), and the 'Other Asian' were approximately 105,000 (30% of the grouping) 1 . Figure 4.1.2 Percentage of the Asian population in CM, level 2 ethnicity (2006), estimated resident, prioritised Chinese 40.0% Indian 44.8% S E Asian 8.0% Other Asian 7.2% Population projection Table 4.1-3 shows future growth of all populations in the CM region based on SNZ's medium projection, updated for the 2006 Census and updated for the recently published national ethnic-specific projections released by SNZ (2 April 2008). New Zealand's Asian population is projected to reach 780,000 by 2026, an increase of 384,000 or 95% over the 2006 figure. Three quarters of this growth is expected to occur in the four cities of Auckland (26). Assuming CMDHB has an even share of this growth then applying the 95% to the total Asian population (extrapolating within CMDHB's overall medium projection) gives growth figures as shown in Table 4.1.3. The 95% growth over the next 20 years compares to an expected growth of only 26% for the other population groups in CMDHB. This projected growth is very dependent on future migration policy and therefore is hard to quantify. The Asian groupings are shown for indicative purposes only by assuming they will stay in the same proportion as existed in 2006. All population projections are speculative -given the extraordinary changes seen in CM over the past 10 years we make no special claims for this one!

The Asian population was a relatively young population with 23% between the ages of 0-14 years and 18% between the ages of 15-24 years respectively. Furthermore, an increase in the 30-49 years age group was found, probably representing the migrant population. Chinese and the 'Other Asian' ethnic group show this bimodal distribution well. This was less prominent in the Indian population where the age group 30-44 years is larger than the younger age groups. The proportion of males and females in all three ethnic groups were relatively similar. Approximately 5% of the Asian population in CM were elderly (65 years or older) compared to approximately 15% in the European population.

The Asian population had grown steadily from 1996 to 2006. In particular, the growth for the Indian and the 'Other Asian' ethnic groups in CM was substantial.  36% 17% 4% 7% 12% 7% 8% 5% 4% How ick Pakuranga Papatoetoe Otara Clevdon Manukau Mangere Manurew a Papkura Franklin The figure below shows the distribution of the three Asian ethnic groups across CM's region. The Chinese and the 'Other Asian\" population were concentrated in the Howick -Pakuranga region (57% & 32% respectively) compared to the Indian population in Papatoetoe, Howick -Pakuranga and Manukau regions (60%). 4.4.2: Percentage of each Asian ethnic group living in Counties Manukau suburbs (2006), usually resident, total response Chinese 57% 8% 5% 9% 7% 4% 4% 3% 3% Indians 16% 28% 3% 5% 16% 9% 12% 6% 5% Other Asians 32% 12% 5% 8% 14% 8% 11% 6% 4% How ick Pakuranga Papatoetoe Otara Clevdon Manukau Mangere Manurew a Papkura Franklin\n\nThe figure below shows the population movement into CM from other places in New Zealand and overseas (migration) in the last five years. Greater mobility was seen into the CM region for all ethnic groups from other places in New Zealand.\n\nThe Chinese population had an approximately equal proportion of local people (people who have been living in CM for more than 5 years), mobility from other places in New Zealand, and overseas migration. The Indian and 'Other Asian' population comprised of approximately 20% local people when compared to 80% mobility from outside CM region. Both these groups consisted of high proportion of recent migrants (40% and 36% respectively). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Mäori Pacific Percentage (%) of people Living in CM Elsewhere in NZ Overseas\n\nApproximately two thirds of the Asian population could speak another language, which was most probably the language they are associated with geographically and culturally (figure 4.6.1). Approximately 17% of the Asian people in CM could not speak English. The percentage of Chinese and 'Other Asian' (22% & 20%) unable to speak English language were higher compared to the Indians (10%) as shown in figure 4.6.2. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European P ercentage (% ) of people English English & other No English 0 5 10 15 20 25 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori Percentage (%) of people\n\nThis has implications for the DHB in terms of access to health services for this population. Providing interpreting services to this population and use of translated material for communicating information regarding NZ healthcare systems, services and entitlements could improve access to health services for this culturally diverse population.\n\nDeprivation is an important factor to consider as it impacts upon health negatively. The NZDep06 ( 27) is a small area-based index of deprivation, combining nine variables: income, receiving benefit, transport, home ownership, living space, employment status, qualifications, support and access to telephone from census 2006 (Appendix 3: Table 13.3.1). The deprivation scores apply to areas rather than individual people. The NZDep06 index of deprivation is usually presented as ordinal scale ranges from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the 10% of areas in NZ with the least deprived scores and 10 the 10% of areas with the most deprived scores (27). The CM Asian population as a whole is fairly evenly distributed across the deprivation deciles, similar to the European population. However, there were significant differences between the Asian sub-groups as shown in the figure below.\n\nChinese people were moderately over-represented in the affluent areas (decile1 & 2 -39%) and under-represented in the most deprived areas (decile 9 & 10 -13%). Indian population follow the opposite pattern, 16% in the two most affluent areas and 40% in the two most deprived areas respectively. The 'Other Asian' group had 29% in the two most affluent areas and 28% in the two most deprived areas respectively. 0 5 10 15 20 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Percentage (%) of People Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian Non Asian/Non-Maori/Non-Pacific\n\nThe unemployment rate at approximately 5% was similar across all CM Asian ethnic groups and higher than the European population (3%). Approximately 55% of the Indian population were employed full time and 28% not in labour force * , similar to that found in European population. Approximately 37% of the Chinese population was employed full time and 45% not in labour force. The figures for the 'Other Asian' group were 41% and 42% respectively. * 'Not in labour force' includes any person in the working-age population who is neither employed nor unemployed. Example -retired, disability, looking after children at home.\n\nEmployed Full-time Employed Part-time Unemployed Not in the Labour force Percentage (%) of People Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European\n\nThe CM Asians were highly educated; approximately 75% or higher had secondary school or higher education. This was similar to the CM European population. Indians were more likely to have a tertiary qualification (42%), compared to the Chinese (36%), 'Other Asian' (31%) and European (37%) populations. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 No Qualification Percentage (%) of people 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Any Secondary School Education Percentage (%) of People Tertiary Education Percentage (%) of People Chinese Indian Other Asian Total Asian European\n\nThe CM Asians as a whole had a higher percentage of people (55%) on low incomes (< $20,000) compared to the European population (36%).

Approximately 9% of CM Asians earned high incomes in comparison to 24% of CM Europeans. Chinese and 'Other Asians' (8% each respectively) were less likely to earn high incomes annually in comparison to Indians (12%).\n\nA lower percentage of CM Asian people (9.3%) received any form of means-tested benefit (unemployment, sickness, domestic purpose and invalids), compared to the CM average. This is similar to the European population (8%). The 'Other Asians' (12.2%) were more likely to receive some form of benefit when compared to the Chinese (8%) and Indian (9.4%) populations.

Note that death counts for 2005 and 2006 are still considered provisional. All data presented in this section is 'total response' ethnicity.\n\nLife expectancy is a summary indicator of a population health, reflecting mortality across all ages from all causes. Life expectancy at birth indicates the total number of years a person could expect to live, based on the mortality rates of the population at each age in a given year or period (28). Figures were collated over three years to improve stability of the estimates, but CM figures are still based on relatively small numbers within each age group, and would be prone to change with a small movement in death numbers.\n\nTable 5.1.1: Life expectancy at birth (in years) in CM and 'All NZ', by gender and ethnicity, 2004-2006, total response CM All NZ Ethnicity Female Male Gap Female Male Gap Chinese 93.8 82.8 11.1 90.0 84.6 5.4 Indian 86.9 81.7 5.1 85.4 81.3 4.1 Other Asian 83.8 81.2 2.6 87.3 83.2 4.0 All Asian 91.2 81.4 9.8 88.3 83.1 5.3 European 84.2 79.6 4.7 83.1 79.1 4.0 Maaori 74.9 69.3 5.6 75.0 70.5 4.5 Pacific 77.9 73.2 4.7 77.8 72.8 5.1\n\nIn CM, the life expectancy of 'All Asian' (male 81.4 and female 91.2 years) was higher than the European population (male 79.6 and female 84.2 years). There was no significant difference in life expectancy between the Indians, 'Other Asians' and the Europeans. The gap between male and female life expectancy in 'All Asian' (9.8 Years) was approximately twice that of Europeans (4.7 years).\n\nChinese females had the highest life expectancy, approximately 9.6 years higher than their counterpart Europeans. No significant gender differences were shown among the Europeans, Indians and 'Other Asians'. The higher life expectancy of the Asian people, particularly the Chinese population may reflect selection processes, the healthy migrant effect and can also be explained by the young demography of this population.\n\nThe life expectancy of 'All NZ' Asians and Europeans were comparable with CM. However, the gender gap in the 'All NZ' Chinese population (5.4 years) was considerably less than CM Chinese population (11.2 years). The above findings are shown in the Figure 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.\n\n, 2004-2006, total response 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Life expectancy at birth in years Fem ale Male Figure 5.1.2: Life expectancy at birth (in years) in All NZ, by gender and ethnicity, 2004-2006, total response 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Life expectancy at birth in years Female Male\n\nThe CM Asians overall had lower adult all cause mortality rates (female and male rates, 400 and 600 per 100,000 respectively) than the European population (680 and 920). The adult all cause mortality rate for Indian males (830) and 'Other Asian' males (700) were considerably higher than the Chinese population but lower than the European population.\n\nEuropean males had significantly higher all cause mortality than females. Although, males had higher adult all cause mortality in the Asian ethnic groups, the gender difference was not statistically significant. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Motality rate (per 100,000) Female Male\n\nThe adult all-cause mortality for 'All NZ' Asian people showed a similar pattern to CMDHB, being lower than the European population as shown in the Figure 5.2.2.\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Motality rate (per 100,000) Females Males\n\nPotentially avoidable mortality (PAM) includes deaths occurring under the age of 75 years that could have potentially been avoided through population-based interventions, or through preventive and curative interventions at an individual level (29). It includes death due to injuries. This gives an indication of the conditions that are avoidable and the interventions that could be targeted to improve life expectancy and the health of the population.\n\nThe top 5 causes, instead of top 10 causes of PAM are discussed below, because of small numbers of mortality at level 2 ethnicity. The top five causes of PAM in descending order for CM 'All Asian' people were ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive respiratory disease and lung cancer. A similar distribution was seen in 'All NZ' Asian people except lung cancer and chronic obstructive respiratory disease were top fourth and fifth causes respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of PAM, followed by stroke for both CM Asians and Europeans. The Chinese and the European population had lower rates of PAM from diabetes when compared to the Indian and the 'Other Asian' population.\n\nAll Asian Chinese Indian Other Asian European Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Ischaemic heart disease 1 106 1 77 1 189 1 88 1 186 Stroke 2 60 2 52 2 82 2 67 2 78 Diabetes 3 38 5 18 3 80 4 45 7 15 Chronic obstructive respiratory disease 4 27 3 27 4 26 5 34 3 53 Lung cancer 5 22 4 22 8 12 3 48 4 40\n\nThe PAM rates were fairly similar in CM and 'All NZ' for the Asian ethnic groups and the European population as shown in Table 5.3.2.\n\nTable 5.3.2: Age-standardised potentially avoidable mortality rate (per 100,000) in 'All NZ' for top 5 causes, 15-74 year olds, males and females combined, 2001-2004, total response All Asian Chinese Indian Other Asian European Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Rank Mortality rate Ischaemic heart Disease 1 107 1 74 1 178 1 113 1 193 Stroke 2 69 2 72 2 73 2 58 2 87 Diabetes 3 37 4 23 3 76 3 33 7 19 Lung cancer 4 27 3 33 4 29 5 17 3 52 Chronic obstructive respiratory disease 5 19 3 33 8 12 4 30 4 43\n\nThe avoidable ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in males and females for CM Asians (153 and 66 per 100,000 respectively) were significantly lower than the CM European population (229 and 150). The avoidable IHD mortality for the CM Indians was significantly higher than the Chinese population.\n\nThe avoidable IHD mortality rate in the Indian male population (306 per 100,000) was approximately similar to the Pacific and Maaori male population and considerably higher than the European males but not statistically significant. It is difficult to comment on the 'Other Asian' group because of small numbers and wide confidence intervals.\n\n.3.1: Age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000) in CM for ischaemic heart disease, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, 2001-2004, total response 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori Mortality rate (per 100,000) Female Male Statistically significant gender differences (male avoidable IHD mortality higher than female) were shown for CM Asians as a whole and in the European population but not at level 2 Asian ethnic groups.

The avoidable IHD mortality for Indian male and female populations were significantly higher than the Chinese population.\n\nNo statistically significant difference was seen in avoidable stroke mortality rate between the Asian and the European population in CM. No significant gender difference was seen in avoidable stroke mortality in all ethnic groups.

No significant gender difference was seen in avoidable diabetes mortality in all ethnic groups. Chinese people in CM had similar diabetes mortality rates to the European population, with lower rates than Indian people.

The CCM CVD programme data was for last one year and the CCM diabetes programme data was for all people enrolled up to date in the programme. The breast screening data was for 2 years (Nov 2005-Oct 2007) and the PHO data was for the year 2006. All data presented in this section is 'total response' ethnicity.\n\nPotentially avoidable hospitalisations (PAH) are admissions to hospital that might be considered to be avoidable and consist of (30):\n\n• Preventable hospitalisations -hospitalisations resulting from diseases that may be prevented through population-based health promotion strategies (e.g. tobacco tax and smoke free laws, exercise, good diet) • Ambulatory sensitive hospitalisations -hospitalisations resulting from disease able to be looked after in a primary health care setting (e.g. vaccine preventable diseases, diabetes control, asthma prevention)\n\nAn age threshold of 75 years is applied because of high prevalence of co-morbidity at older ages. It also excludes hospitalisations due to injury, for which different preventive strategies apply.\n\nIn CM, 'All Asian' males and females had significantly lower PAH rates for all causes (3800 and 3000 per 100,000 respectively) than their European counterparts (4500 and 3700). The Indian male and female PAH rates for all causes (6400 and 5300) were significantly higher than the Chinese (1800 and 1400) and the European population. The 'Other Asian' ethnic group had PAH hospitalisation rates higher than the Chinese but lower than the Indian population.\n\nIn CM, the Asian (except the 'Other Asian') and European males had significantly higher PAH rates compared to the females. See  1: Age-standardised potentially avoidable hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) in CM for all causes, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, 2004-2006, total response 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Hospitalisation rate (per 100,000)\n\nThe distribution of the PAH rates in the Asian and European populations in 'All NZ' was similar to CM. 'All Asian' males and females had significantly lower PAH rates for all causes (3100 and 2600 per 100,000 respectively) than their European counterparts (4100 and 3400). The Indian male and female PAH rates for all causes (5500 and 4500) were significantly higher than the Chinese (1900 and 1600) and the European population. The 'Other Asian' ethnic group had PAH rates higher than the Chinese but lower than the Indian population.\n\nIn 'All NZ' males had significantly higher PAH rates compared to the females across all ethnic groups. The overall pattern mirrored the CM experience -see Figure 6.1.2. Figure 6.1.2: Age-standardised potentially avoidable hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) in 'All NZ' for all causes, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, 2004-2006, total response 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) Females Males Angina and chest pain 1 897 1 263 1 1794 1 786 1 Myocardial infarction 2 333 4 98 2 711 2 304 3 Diabetes 3 223 8 66 3 465 4 226 9 Stroke 4 220 2 153 5 301 3 292 10 CORD 5 169 3 101 6 295 8 146 5 Kidney/urinary infection 6 155 7 72 7 251 7 172 8 Congestive heart failure 7 153 10 59 4 389 23 32 7 Pneumonia 8 139 6 80 9 204 5 196 6 Asthma 9 103 18 26 8 209 11 95 13 Cellulitis 10 97 14 47 11 142 10 131 4\n\nThe 'All Asian' male population in CM had significantly higher PAH for angina and chest pain (1100 per 100,000) than the European population (900). The male and female PAH for angina and chest pain were highest for the Indian population (2100 and 1400 per 100,000) and lowest for the Chinese population (270 and 250) when all ethnic groups (including Maaori and Pacific) were considered.\n\nA significant gender difference existed amongst most ethnic groups, with males having higher rates compared to females, except in Chinese and 'Other Asian' groups where they were comparable, and Maaori where female had higher rates than male. See Figure 6.2.1. Figure 6.2.1: Age-standardised hospitalisation rates (per 100,000) for angina and chest pain, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, for CM, 2004-2006, total response 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori Hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) Female Male\n\nIn CM no statistically significant difference were seen in the PAH rates for myocardial infarction between 'All Asians' and Europeans. However, the PAH rates for myocardial infarction were significantly high in the male and female Indian population (980 and 430 per 100,000 respectively) compared to Chinese population (140 and 60). The low rates of myocardial infarction in the Chinese population averaged out the high rates in the Indian population, when the broad category 'Asian' was used.\n\nThe rates of PAH for myocardial infarction in Indian males were considerably higher than the Pacific and Maaori males. A significant gender difference existed for myocardial infarction, male hospitalisations being higher than the female for most ethnic groups except Chinese, 'Other Asian' and Maaori. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori Hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) Female Male\n\nIn CM, no statistically significant difference were seen in the PAH rates for diabetes between 'All Asians' and Europeans. However, hospitalisation rates for diabetes were significantly higher in the Indian population compared to the European and Chinese populations. The low rates of diabetes in the Chinese population averaged out the high rates in the Indian population when the broad category 'Asian' was used.\n\nThe PAH rates for diabetes in Indians, while higher than Chinese or European were lower than the Maaori and Pacific populations. A significant gender difference was present in the PAH rates for diabetes in Europeans but not among the Asian ethnic groups. There are many reasons why people are admitted to hospital. The high hospitalisation rates for Maori and Pacific compared to Indian comes despite a relatively similar prevalence of disease (see next section). This has been interpreted in various ways -lower use of primary care; poorer diabetes control, more severe disease -further work is underway to ascertain the burden of diabetes in these populations. At this stage it does not appear to be a relative under-use of hospital care by Indian people with diabetes. 6.2.3: Age-standardised hospitalisation rates (per 100,000) for diabetes, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, for CM, 2004-2006, total response 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori H ospitalisation rate (per 100,000) Female Male Diabetes prevalence Figure 6.2.4: Age-standardised prevalence (% of adult population 16+ years of age) of self reported diabetes in CM, by gender and ethnicity, (LBD Survey 2007), total response 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacif ic P revalence (% ) of diabetes\n\nMales Total\n\nThe Lets Beat Diabetes (LBD) survey showed the prevalence of diabetes in CM. The diabetes prevalence in Indians (8%) was significantly higher than the Chinese (5%), 'Other Asian (5.1%) and the European population (5.6%). In all ethnic groups, females had higher rates of diabetes than males. See Figure 6.2.4.\n\nThe self-reported doctor-diagnosed diabetes, obtained from 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey (NZHS) showed that prevalence of diabetes in 'All NZ' in Indians (9.4%) was significantly higher than the Chinese (3.4%), 'Other Asians' (5.7%) and the European population (4.1%) (5,30). Although, there were some differences, the LBD survey results were quite comparable with the NZHS 2002/03. 6.2.5: Diabetes prevalence (% of adult population 15+ years of age) in CM, by ethnicity (estimate from multiple databases), total response 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacific Prevalence (%) of diabetes\n\nAn estimate of people with diagnosed diabetes living in CMDHB was enumerated by 'Known Diabetes' project from multiple data bases, such as CMDHB inpatients and outpatients, CMDHB diabetes waitlist, diabetes referrals (in PIMS), diabetes CCM enrolees, Get Checked enrolees and retinal screening patients. Prevalence of diabetes in adult Indians (8.9%) was significantly higher than the Chinese (2.6%) and European (4.7%) populations. The prevalence was averaged to 5.5% when 'All Asian' population was considered, highlighting the importance of analysing data at level 2 ethnicity. See Figure 6.2.5. The Known Diabetes project results are very consistent with the LBD survey and NZHS results, pointing to a significant health concern for the Indian community. Based on these figures around 2300-2500 Indian people had diagnosed diabetes in CM in 2007, with perhaps 600-800 more currently undiagnosedfoot_2 .\n\nIn CM, the PAH rates for stroke in 'All Asian' population were significantly higher compared to European population. Although, the rates were higher for the Indian and the 'Other Asian' population when compared to the Chinese, they were not statistically significant because of wide confidence intervals. Significant gender difference, rates higher in males than females were shown for the European population but not amongst the Asian population.

The PAH rates for CORD were significantly higher in the Indian males (490 per 100,000) and lower in Chinese males (120), compared to European male population (320).\n\nThe European and the Indian population showed significant gender difference with much higher rates in males than females, presumably reflecting past smoking rates in those populations. See Figure 6.2.7.\n\nNo statistically significant difference were shown in the PAH rates for kidney/urinary infections between 'All Asians' and the Europeans. However, both male and female rates PAH rates for kidney/urinary infections were significantly lower in the Chinese population compared to the Indian and European population. See Figure 6.2.8.

The PAH rate for CHF was highest in Indian females, significantly higher than the rates in all Asian ethnic groups and Europeans (both sexes). The Chinese and the 'Other Asian' numbers were very low. See Figure 6.2.9.\n\nIn CM the PAH rates for cellulitis were significantly lower (approximately three times) in 'All Asian' male and female population when compared to the European population. Among the Asian ethnic groups, the rates (both male and female) were significantly lower in the Chinese population when compared to the Indian population. See Figure 6.2.10. 6.2.10: Age-standardised hospitalisation rates (per 100,000) for cellulitis, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, for CM, 2004-2006, total response 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Hospita;isation rate (per 100,000) Female Male\n\nIn CM, the PAH rates for asthma in 'All Asian' males were significantly higher than the European males.

The Indian males had significantly higher rates when compared to Chinese males. Significant gender difference, higher rates in males than females was seen in European population but not among all the Asian ethnic groups. See Figure 6.2.12. 6.2.12: Age-standardised potentially avoidable hospitalisation rates (per 100,000) for pneumonia, 15-74 year olds, by gender and ethnicity, for CM, 2004-2006, total response 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European hospitalisation rate (per 100,000) Female Male\n\nIn this section, a range of relatively high-cost, high-volume surgical procedures were selected for use as indicators. The surgical intervention rates over three years (2004-06) in CM were compared with national rates by ethnicity (total response).\n\nAngioplasty (or more properly percutaneous coronary intervention), is a therapeutic procedure, usually non-invasive, to treat the narrowed coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease. In CM no statistically significant difference was shown in intervention rates for angioplasty between 'All Asian' (114 per 100,000) and European (135) population. However, the CM Indians (230) had significantly higher intervention rates for angioplasty than all Asian ethnic groups, Europeans, Pacific and Maaori population (Figure 6.3.1). The angioplasty rate ratio of Indian to European was in proportion to their IHD hospitalisation rates, and higher than the mortality differential, probably indicating good access to services. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacific Surgery rate per 100,000\n\nThe CM Chinese (45 per 100,000) had significantly lower intervention rates than the Indians, Europeans, Pacific and Maaori population. Again this appears to in proportion to their mortality and IHD hospitalisation rates. The intervention rates for angioplasty in CM Indians were approximately five times that of the Chinese population.\n\nIn 'All NZ' the picture was similar to that seen in CM, as seen in Figure 6.3.2. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacific Surgery rate per 100,000\n\nIn CABG surgery arteries or veins from elsewhere in the patient's body are grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass atherosclerotic narrowing. For CM patients this surgery is usually performed at Auckland City Hospital. For CM residents no statistically significant differences were shown in intervention rates for CABG between 'All Asians' and Europeans. Indians (84 per 100,000) had significantly higher CABG when compared to the Europeans (43) and Chinese (26) populations, in proportion to the angioplasty rates noted above. The CABG rates for Indian males were highest (132). See  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacific Surgery rate per 100,000\n\nThe CABG intervention rates nationally were similar to CM. No significant differences were shown between 'All Asians' and Europeans but the rates were significantly higher for the Indians and lower for the Chinese people (Figure 6.3.4).\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Maori Pacific Surgery rate per 100,000\n\nTotal hip joint replacement Hip joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted to relieve arthritis restrictions and pain or to fix severe physical joint damage as part of hip fracture treatment. In CM the intervention rate for total hip replacement was significantly higher in the European population (110 per 100,000) when compared to the 'All Asian' population (15). See Figure 6.3.5. This is in contrast to knee replacement (below) where there is a smaller excess -maybe 50% higher. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Surgery rate (per 100,000)\n\nOne could speculate whether the height difference in the current older generation of Europeans and Asians create a mechanical increased risk of hip fracture 3 4 . It does not seem likely that osteoarthritis prevalence differences would match this 10-fold differential as that would show in knee replacement rates. No statistically significant differences were shown for total hip replacement between any of the level 2 Asian ethnic groups for CM, and the all New Zealand rates follow the same pattern.

In CM no statistically significant differences were shown in intervention rates for total knee replacement between 'All Asians' and the Europeans. See Figure 6.3.7. Among the Asians, Indians (150 per 100,000) had significantly higher rates than the Chinese (30) population, and are likely to have a higher rate than Europeans. The intervention rates for total knee replacement were similar for 'All NZ' and CM. No statistically significant differences were shown between the 'All Asian' and the European population. The Indian rates (140 per 100,000) were significantly higher than the Chinese (16) and European (87) population.

It is mainly carried out laparoscopically. In CM no statistically significant differences were shown in intervention rates for cholecystectomy between any of the level 2 Asian ethnic groups, or between the 'All Asian' and the European population. See Figure 6.3.9. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Surgery rate (per 100,000)\n\nThe intervention rates for cholecystectomy in 'All NZ' followed a different pattern compared to CM. 'All Asians' had significantly lower rates (73 per 100,000) than Europeans (113) population. Among the Asians, the Indians had significantly higher rates (93) than the Chinese (55) population. See Figure 6.3.10. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Surgery rate (per 100,000)\n\nRemoval of cataracts is the most common ophthalmologic procedure. Cataracts are opacities that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope, and are the most common cause of blindness across the world. In CM the intervention rates for cataract extraction were significantly higher in 'All Asian' (350 per 100,000) than the European (170) population. The Indian rates were significantly higher (575 per 100,000) than the Chinese (175 per 100,000) population.

The rates were significantly higher in 'All Asian' (340 per 100,000) compared to European (207) population.. Amongst the Asians, the Indians had significantly higher rates (550) than the Chinese (230). See Figure 6.3.12.\n\nThe intervention rates for cataract extraction were highest in the Pacific population followed by the Indians, both in CM and 'All NZ', probably reflecting the high rates of diabetes and its complications in these populations. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Surgery rate (per 100,000)\n\nA prostatectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of the prostate gland, usually due to abnormalities of the prostate such as a tumour or other enlargement. The procedure can be either open or more usually transurethral. In CM no statistically significant differences were shown in intervention rates for prostatectomy between any of the level 2 Asian ethnic groups, or between the 'All Asian' and the European population. See Figure 6.3.13.

Amongst the Asians, more number of Indians were enrolled than other Asian ethnic groups. However, these numbers were proportionately lower compared to Europeans, Maaori and Pacific populations -less than a half on a population basis, and considering the high burden of cardiovascular disease in the Indian population possibly a quarter or what might have been expected. See Table 6\n\nPeople could be enrolled on the CCM CVD programme for a year, with many being enrolled following a specific cardiac event. Table 6.4.4 compares the percentage of people enrolled with the CVD programme with the number of people hospitalised with MI in the last year. Having a heart attack in the last year is a fundamental marker of cardiovascular disease and should be very clear motivation for both the patient and their physician to be involved in the CVD programme.\n\nThe percentage of 'All Asians' enrolled were lower than the Europeans. Although the Indian population had high CVD risk the percentage enrolled in CVD CCM was lower than the European rate. The percentage of Maaori enrolled was greater than 100%, probably because the CCM programme has been targeting the Maaori population. Many Maaori people were enrolled in both CCM diabetes and CVD programme, as they had high CVD risk but had not necessarily had an MI in the last year.\n\nTable 6.4.4: Percentage of people with myocardial infarction hospitalisation enrolled in the CCM CVD programme in CM, by ethnicity (2006), total response Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maaori MI hosp annually 15 93 14 121 692 177 128 Enrolled 8 43 14 65 448 119 209 % enrolled 54.5 46.2 97.7 53.7 64.7 67.2 163.7\n\nScreening for breast cancer via mammography is one of the few preventive interventions proven to be effective in reducing female breast cancer mortality. In CM the percentage of women 45-69 years age receiving mammogram in the last two years was lower for 'All Asians'(42%) compared to Europeans (50%). No significant differences were shown amongst the Asians at level 2 ethnicity. See Figure 6.5.1.\n\nAccording to the NZHS 2002/03 the percentage of self reported mammogram in the last 3 years for women aged 50-64 years was significantly lower for Asians compared to Europeans (31). Although the CM data is more limited, it is similar and comparable to the national data. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Percentage of women (45-69 years) received mamogram\n\nNo data for cervical screening was available for CM Asians. According to the NZHS 2002/03, the percentage of cervical smears in women 20-69 years (who had not had a hysterectomy) was significantly higher for European women (approximately 75%) when compared to Asians (approximately 40%) (31). No significant differences were shown amongst the Asians at level 2 ethnicity (5).\n\nThis section presents the PHO enrolment by age and ethnicity; and data on the frequency of use of primary care, obtained from the LBD survey.\n\nPrimary Health Organisations (PHOs) have been the main vehicles through which the Primary Health Care Strategy (32) has been implemented. PHOs are the local structures for delivering and co-coordinating primary health care services. Enrolment with a PHO means that the person enrolling intends to use a PHO provider (general practice or health service) as their normal provider of ongoing first level services.\n\nPrimary Health Organisation (PHO) enrolment  30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Pacific Maori Percentage (%) of people enrolled\n\nTable 6.7.1: Age-standardised percentage of people enrolled with a PHO in CM, by age and ethnicity as at December 2006, total response 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 65+ Total Chinese 47 49 42 49 53 56 49 Indian 88 87 78 90 93 125 89 Other Asian 91 98 80 97 114 181 99 All Asian 76 77 65 77 80 94 76 European 66 74 83 83 88 93 83 Pacific 85 91 87 102 97 109 94 Maaori 81 87 90 95 92 90 90 Table 6.7.1 shows the percentage of enrolled population by age bands and ethnicity.\n\nChinese people across all age bands were significantly less likely to utilise primary care services, which was similar to that shown in the Asian Health Chart Book (5).\n\nThe percentage of people enrolled with the PHO includes the population domiciled in CM and enrolled with CMDHB PHOs. Omitted were those that were enrolled in PHOs from other DHB regions, although living in CM region. There is a possibility that Chinese people use either complementary or alternative providers; or utilise primary care services from services in other DHBs.\n\nThe percentage of people who had seen their general practitioner (GP) or nurse was identified from the LBD survey 2007 (Figure 6.7.2). The Chinese were less likely to see their GP or nurse in the last 12 months when compared to Indians and 'Other Asians'. 'All Asians' had a lower prevalence of reporting seeing a GP or nurse in the previous 12 months. Females were more likely to report seeing their GP or nurse among Asians and Europeans.

No significant difference was present among the Asian ethnic groups • According to the NZHS the rates of cervical screening were significantly higher for European women than Asian women. No statistically significant difference was shown among the Asian ethnic groups Primary health care access • 'All Asians', particularly the Chinese had a lower prevalence of seeing a GP or nurse in the previous 12 months compared to the Europeans. • The percentage of Asian people enrolled with the PHOs was lower than the Europeans, with the enrolment of Chinese people across all age bands particularly lower 7 Risk and protective factors This section presents results on risk and protective factors, obtained from the LBD survey 2007. Data on smoking prevalence was also obtained from Census 2006. Results of physiological risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, overweight and obesity; obtained from the NZHS 2002/03 were summarised from the Asian Health Chart Book.\n\nThe Census 2006 is the best source of data on smoking prevalence and identified regular smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers. The definition of a regular smoker used for the census is someone who smokes cigarettes regularly, ie one or more cigarettes a day. An ex-smoker is defined as someone who used to smoke regularly, but no longer does. The definition for never smoked regularly is people who have never been regular smokers. Smoking of pipes, cigars and cigarillos, other smoked substances such as marijuana and tobacco used for chewing are not included in these definitions (33). In contrast the LBD survey identified only current smokers with a single question.\n\nThe smoking prevalence in all Asian ethnic groups was significantly lower than European. The percentage of ex-smokers was significantly lower and never smokers significantly higher among the Asian population than the European population. See  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Current smoker Ex Smoker Never Smoker Percentage (%) of People Chinese Indian Other Asian Table 7.1.1 and Figure 7.1.2 shows the age-standardised prevalence of smoking by gender and ethnicity from the LBD survey. 'All Asian' males and females were significantly less likely to be smokers compared to Europeans. No statistically significant difference was seen in the prevalence of smoking among the Asian ethnic groups. The smoking prevalence was significantly low among women in all Asian ethnic groups, particularly among Indian women. Table 7.1.1: Age-standardised prevalence (% of adult population 16+ years of age) of current smoking in CM, by gender and ethnicity, LBD Survey 2007, total response Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Female 5.2% 1.5% 4.5% 3.8% 16.7% Male 17.5% 17.6% 24.3% 19.4% 21.1% Total 11.0% 9.6% 13.3% 11.3% 18.8% Figure 7.1.2: Age-standardised prevalence (% of adult population 16+ ) of current smoking in CM, LBD Survey 2007, total response 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Prevalence (%) of current smokers Females Males\n\nThe LBD survey showed slightly higher prevalence of smoking for the Asian population and lower prevalence for the European population but the findings were comparable with smoking prevalence from Census.

Women in all ethnic groups, Asian and European were more likely to meet the recommendation of vegetable intake. The recommended vegetable intake was most prevalent amongst Indian men (15%) followed by Chinese (11%) and 'Other Asians' (9%) respectively.\n\nThe results from the LBD survey were quite different to those from the NZHS 2002/03. According to the NZHS, overall, two-thirds adults ate the recommended three or more servings of vegetables per day (31). The intake of recommended vegetables for Asians (approximately 50%) was significantly lower than Europeans. Although the LBD survey showed low vegetable consumption among Asians and Europeans, the differences in vegetable intake between Asians and Europeans was similar in both surveys.\n\nAccording to the Asian Health Chart Book, Indians and 'Other Asians' were significantly less likely to consume the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables (5+ a day) than the Europeans (5).\n\nThe results for this risk factor were obtained from the NZHS 2002/03, described in the Asian Health Chart Book. Although the data was national, similar prevalence would be expected in the Asian population of CM.\n\n• No statistically significant association for self-reported high cholesterol was seen between Asian ethnic groups and Europeans, except the Indians.\n\nThe results for this risk factor were obtained from the NZHS 2002/03, described in the Asian Health Chart Book. Although the data was national, similar prevalence would be expected in the Asian population of CM.\n\n• Chinese and 'Other Asians were less likely to self-report high blood pressure than Europeans. However, longer the duration of residence in New Zealand, more the likelihood of self-reported high blood pressure\n\nThe results for this risk factor were obtained from the NZHS 2002/03, described in the Asian Health Chart Book. Although the data was national, similar prevalence would be expected in the Asian population of CM.\n\nThe ethnic specific BMI cut-points for Asians as suggested by WHO(36) are: overweight (23.0-24.9)and obesity (25.0) respectively.\n\n• Using the ethnic specific BMI cut-points, Chinese and 'Other Asians' males had a significantly lower prevalence of overweight than the total population\n\n• Indians (both sexes) had a significantly lower prevalence of overweight than the total population\n\n• Chinese and 'Other Asian' females had a higher prevalence of overweight than their male counterparts (although the difference is not statistically significant)\n\n• Indians had a higher prevalence of obesity than Europeans. Duration of residence increases the likelihood of being obese.\n\nThis section presents data on the following:\n\n• Infant mortality -all cause in CM and 'All NZ' by ethnicity\n\n• Child mortality -all cause in CM and 'All NZ' by ethnicity • Percentage of births that are low birth weight in CM and 'All NZ' • Child (0-14 years) PAH for all causes in CM and 'All NZ' by gender and ethnicity • Top 10 causes of Child PAH in CM, by ethnicity • Immunisation and Well Child coverage in CM All data were obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service for years 2004 -2006. Immunisation and Well Child coverage was obtained from Kidslink for birth cohorts 05 to 08 at a specific point (01.01.2005) of time. It would have been preferable to get more up to date data from the National Immunisation Register (NIR), but this was not available in a useful format. All data presented in this section is 'total response' ethnicity.\n\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths in the first year of life per 1000 live births. It is a most common indicator of child health status and is used to compare health and well-being of populations across and within countries.\n\nAs the numbers were small, both the actual numbers of infant deaths along with the rates are presented in Table 8.1.1. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results as one extra death in the population can significantly influence the rate, which can be a variation due to chance alone(24). 1.1: Infant mortality rate (per 1,000) in CM and 'All NZ' for all causes, by ethnicity (2004-2006), total response 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Mortality rate (per 1,000) CMDHB All NZ\n\nThe age standardised child mortality rates in CM and 'All NZ' were higher for the Asian population as a whole than the European population. The Chinese child mortality rates were higher in CM, difficult to comment because of small numbers and lack of confidence intervals. The Indian IMR was higher than the Europeans in both CM and 'All NZ'. See Table 8\n\nLow birth weight is defined as a birth weight less than 2500 grams, caused by prematurity or to intrauterine growth retardation (small for gestational age). Low birth weight is correlated with higher neonatal morbidity and mortality and it has also been suggested that babies who are growth restricted at birth have a greater risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes in later life (37). 3.1: Percentage of births LBW (<2500g), by ethnicity in CM and 'All NZ', 2004-2006, total response 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European Percentage of LBW (<2500g) CMDHB All NZ\n\nThe main determinants of small for gestational age are poor maternal nutrition, smoking, hypertension, while the main determinants for preterm births are genital tract infection, multiple birth, pregnancy induced hypertension and obstetric problems. Therefore, preventive measures differ between the two aetiologies and include smoking cessation, prenatal care (primary prevention), antenatal care (secondary prevention) and specialist obstetric and neonatal care (tertiary services).\n\nThere were significant differences in mean birth weights between different ethnic groups. A study from National women's Hospital database from 1993-2000, showed that the mean birth weights for European and Indian babies were 3521 and 3192 grams respectively (38). Although, caution should be exercised when using 2500 grams as the LBW cut-point for Indian babies, there is sufficient research proposing 7.1: Percentage of children having Well Child checks completed by 1 Jan 2005 in CM, birth cohorts 05-08 combined, by ethnicity 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 6 week 3 month 5 month 9 month 15 month Well child check event % Having Well child check completed Chinese Indian Other Asian All Asian European 9 Women's/maternal health This section presents data on the following: • Number of deliveries and average maternal age for first and all deliveries in CM • Total fertility rate (15-44years) in CM by ethnicity • Teenage deliveries in CM and 'All NZ' by ethnicity • Percentage of assisted deliveries, caesarean sections, deliveries complicated by pre-eclampsia and diabetes in CM and ''All NZ'' by ethnicity • Age-standardised hospitalisation rates for pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy per 100,000 women in CM and 'All NZ' by ethnicity • Age-standardised rates for termination of pregnancy per 1,000 women, public (Epsom Day Unit) and private (Auckland Medical Aid Centre) settings All data, except the termination of pregnancy data were obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service for years 2004-2006 and is 'total response' ethnicity.

Recognising these differences and monitoring the health of Asian people at level 2 ethnicity would assist in identifying and improving their health needs.\n\nThe following recommendations were made to the Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) Chief Funding and Planning Officer:\n\n1. Priority should be given to reduce the health inequalities in Indians o A strategic approach is needed to address and reduce the high rates of low birth weight, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in this ethnic group\n\no CMDHB's service development and health gain priority areas should also target Indian people in the interventions such as, Let's Beat Diabetes, Youth Health Plan, Chronic Diseases Plan, Primary Care Plan, Child Health Plan o Awareness of the above conditions and the risk factors should be raised in the Indian community through community organisations, PHO's and use of appropriate media o 'Lets Beat Diabetes' five year plan needs to acknowledge Indian as high risk group. Development of community leadership and action should be supported, to empower this community to slow the progression of diabetes o CCM Diabetes and CVD programmes should include Indians in their high risk groups and encourage their enrolment within the programmes o Look for interventions at community level that have been shown to be effective in addressing the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the Indian communities. CMDHB should advocate to include Indians as a priority group in the 'Healthy Eating -Healthy Action' (HEHA) Implementation Plan 2004-2010 2. Improve primary care access and preventive services for Chinese people o The advantage in health of Chinese people is likely to regress with acculturation and as the 'selection' effect wanes. Efforts should be made to monitor the health of this population, learn the positive aspects and encourage health promotion messages in a culturally appropriate manner o Information regarding health system in New Zealand, primary care and cancer screening should be disseminated in a culturally consist manner to improve access 3. Reliable data collection of Asian as an entire group and sub-group o Reliable data collection as entire group and sub groups is essential to better understand the diversity and particular health issues of this population. CMDHB should advocate for consistency in ethnicity classification at national, District Health Board (DHB), PHO and Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) level o Data and information need to be gathered about best practices and lessons learned from health promotion activities and health interventions, particularly at the community level and disseminated widely 4. Future work and research o Further analysis of health indicators such as mental illness, cancer and infectious diseases, not addressed by this HNA should be conducted o Further research into effects of migration and differences between first and second generation Asians is required to understand the effects of acculturation and migrant needs o Further research is required at community and national level to understand the risk factors of CVD in Indians.
