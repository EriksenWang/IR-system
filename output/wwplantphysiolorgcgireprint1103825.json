    "abstract": "Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that occur widely among plants. Lectins of plant vegetative tissues are less well characterized than those of seeds. Previously, a protein of soybean (Clycine max [L.] Merr.) leaves was shown to possess properties similar to the seed lectin. Here we show that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein shares 63% identity with the seed lectin. lmmunoblot analysis indicated that the protein occurs in leaves, petioles, stems, and cotyledons of seedlings but not in seeds. These observations prompted designation of the protein as a soybean vegetative lectin (SVL). lmmunohistochemical localization in leaves indicated that SVL was localized to the vacuoles of bundlesheath and paraveinal mesophyll cells. Removal of sink tissues or exposure to atmospheric methyl jasmonate caused increased levels of SVL in leaves and cotyledons. Co-precipitation of SVL and the soybean vegetative storage protein (VSP) during purification sug- gested an interaction between these proteins. SVL-horseradish peroxidase conjugate bound to dot blots of VSP or SVL, and binding was inhibited by porcine stomach mucin and heparin but not simple carbohydrates. Binding between SVL and VSP and similarities in localization and regulation support a possible in vivo interaction between these proteins.\nAbbreviations: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; SBA, soybean agglutinin; SVL, soybean vegetative lectin; VSP, soybean vegetative storage protein.",
    "full_text": "Lectins are abundant carbohydrate-binding proteins that are widely distributed but of uncertain function in plants (Etzler, 1986;Goldstein and Poretz, 1986;Kijne et al., 1986;Pusztai, 1991). Lectins of leguminous seeds are among the most extensively studied of the plant lectins. The lectins found in legume seeds make up a family of related proteins sharing structural and amino acid sequence homologies (Strosberg et al., 1986;Sharon and Lis, 1990). Typically, these lectins are glycoproteins consisting of subunits with molecular masses in a range of 25 to 35 kD arranged as dimers or tetramers. Lectins are particularly abundant in the seeds of legumes, making up as much as 10% of the total seed protein (Etzler, 1986). The seed lectins accumulate in protein storage vacuoles of cotyledons and are degraded during seed germination and maturation of the seedling (Pusztai, 1991). Lectins also occur in vegetative organs including leaves, stem, roots, and bark (Borrebaeck, 1984;Etzler, 1986;Van Damme and Peumans, 1990;Ho Pak et al., 1992). In general, vegetative lectins are present at much lower levels than those of seeds and have not been as\n\nThis material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. DCB-9104525.

Although some vegetative lectins possess strong homologies with seed lectins, others display unusual carbohydrate-binding characteristics and an inability to agglutinate erythrocytes (Etzler, 1986(Etzler, , 1994a;;Pusztai, 1991).\n\nA protein found in leaves of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) plants was shown to possess structural and immunological similarities to SBA, the major lectin of soybean seeds (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). Like SBA, the soybean leaf protein is a 120-kD glycoprotein with a tetrameric arrangement of subunits. The subunits of the leaf protein have molecular masses of 28 and 33 kD and react with antibodies raised against the seed lectin (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). In this investigation we provide further evidence that the leaf protein, henceforth referred to as a SVL, is widely distributed in soybean plants and is a member of the legume lectin family.\n\nDespite their ubiquity, the specific functions of vegetative lectins are unresolved. A variety of studies have supported the hypothesis that lectins found in roots of some plants may be involved in symbiotic interactions between the plants and microorganisms (Pueppke et al., 1978;Pusztai, 1991). However, functions suggested for lectins in other vegetative tissues are based largely on conjecture. Roles suggested for these lectins relate to plant defense and stress physiology, carbohydrate metabolism, and packaging of storage proteins (Rudiger, 1984;Etzler, 1986;Kijne et al., 1986).\n\nThe physiological functions of plant lectins will not be fully understood until the identity and biological function of endogenous receptors are elucidated (Kijne et al., 1986). No such receptors have been unequivocally identified for plant lectins. Previously, we reported that SVL and the soybean VSP co-precipitate during purification of SVL from leaf homogenate and suggested a possible interaction between these two proteins (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). VSP is a dimeric glycoprotein comprising subunits with molecular masses of approximately 27 and 29 kD (Wittenbach, 1983) arranged as homo-and heterodimers (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). VSP is widely distributed among plant tissues, including stems, flowers, seed pods, and cotyledons (Mason et al., 1988;Staswick, 1989), where it is believed to provide temporary storage for nitrogen and photoassimilates (Wittenbach, 1983;Staswick, 1990). In Plant Physiol. Vol. 110,1996 leaves VSP is stored in the vacuoles of bundle-sheath and paraveinal mesophyll cells (Franceschi et al., 1983), a tissue specialized for synthesis, storage, and remobilization of photoassimilates (Franceschi and Giaquinta, 1983). Re-mova1 of seed pods, phloem girdling, and other treatments that disrupt the transport of photoassimilates to sink organs induce an accumulation of VSP (Wittenbach, 1983;Staswick, 1990). SVL in leaves also increases in sinkdeprived plants (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989), although other factors that may regulate SVL have not been investigated. One such factor is methyl jasmonate, a natural substance that occurs widely among plants. Methyl jasmonate has been shown to induce gene expression and accumulation of VSP and other proteins in soybean plants (Anderson et al., 1989;Franceschi and Grimes, 1991;Staswick et al., 1991; for review, see Staswick, 1992).\n\nIn this paper we report further characterization of SVL. We show that SVL and VSP are co-localized at the organ and cellular levels and display similar responses to sink tissue deprivation and methyl jasmonate. Furthermore, we have used SVL conjugated with HSP to demonstrate binding between SVL and VSP.\n\nSoybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr. var FFR-343) plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber under a 14-h photoperiod in Sunshine I11 potting mix (Sungrow Horticulture, Bellevue, WA). Plants were fertilized weekly with a nutrient solution (Streeter, 1978) containing 20 mM NH,NO,. In some experiments leaves were harvested from plants at anthesis. Other plants were allowed to set seed normally (control) or their seed pods were removed daily (depodded plants), and tissues were harvested 30 d postanthesis. In other experiments, seedlings were allowed to grow normally (control) or, beginning 4 d postemergence, their epicotyl and axillary shoots were removed (sink deprived). Cotyledons were harvested from seedlings 10 d postemergence. Seed pods and seeds designated \"immature\" were harvested 20 d postanthesis from plants allowed otherwise to set seed normally. Dry seeds were designated '\"ature.\"\n\nA11 procedures were carried out at 4\"C, and a11 centrifugations were performed at 12,OOOg. A11 protein chromatography procedures were performed using a Pharmacia Fast Protein Liquid Chromatograph. Protein fractions were concentrated using an ultrafiltration cell with a PM-30 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). A11 percentage concentrations given below are weights/volume.\n\nPlant tissues were homogenized in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) containing 30 mM ascorbic acid, 28 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.03 g/mL insoluble PVP (20 g tissue/100 mL buffer) with a mortar and pestle or an Ultra-Turrax T-25 homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) for large sample volumes. Crude ho-mogenates were passed through two layers of cheesecloth and then centrifuged.\n\nPurification of SVL SVL and VSP were purified from leaves of depodded plants. Ammonium sulfate was added sequentially to centrifuged leaf homogenate to final concentration:, of 25, 45, 55, and 75% saturation, with each precipitate removed by centrifugation. The 55% ammonium sulfate precipitate was resolubilized in buffer A plus 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed overnight against 2 X 500 mL of this buffer. The precipitate that formed during dialysis wa:j collected by centrifugation, washed twice with buffer A, and redissolved in buffer A plus 1 M NaC1. This fraction is referred to as the \"dialysis precipitate.\" Dialysis precipiteite (200-pL volumes) was chromatographed through a Superose HR-12 10/30 column equilibrated in buffer A plus 1 M NaCl and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min-'. Fractions containing SVL were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -80°C. When necessary, SVL samples were rechromatographed to remove remaining traces of VSP.\n\nThe 75% ammonium sulfate fraction was redissolved in buffer B (100 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 500 II~M NaC1, 1 mM CaCI,, 1 mM MgCl,, 1 mM MnC1,) and dialyzed overnight against 2 X 500 mL of the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was applied to a column containing Con-A Sepharose 48 (25-mL bed volume) pre-equilibrated in buffer B. Nonbinding protein was eluted by washing the column with approximately 5 column volumes of buffer B, and bound protein was subsequently eluted by washing the column with buffer B plus 500 mM a-methyl-D-mannopyranoside. Fractions containing bound protein were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 2 X 500 mL of buffer A. The dialysate was applied to a Mono-Q HR 5 / 5 column pre-equilibrated in buffer A, and the column was washed with buffer A until the A,,, approached zero. EIound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient (15 mM NaCl mL-', 0.5 mL min-'). Fractions containing the VSP peak eluting at approximately 100 mM NaCl were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -80°C.\n\nCentrifuged leaf homogenate (100 pL) was applied to a Superose 12-HR 10/30 column pre-equilibrated in buffer A plus 50 mM NaCl and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The column fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. The column was calibrated using the following protein standards: ferritin (450 kD), catalase (240 kD), aldolase (158 kD), BSA (68 kD), ovalbumin (45 kD), chymotrypsinogen-A (25 kD), and Cyt c (12.5 kD). The void volume was determined using blue dextran.\n\nRabbit antibodies to SVL and VSP were prepared commercially (Lampire Biologicals, Inc., Pipersville, PA). Dial-ysis precipitate (100 pg) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant was injected into New Zealand White rabbits at O, 1,2, and 4 weeks, and antiserum was collected 3 weeks after the final injection.\n\nAntibodies specific to the peptide portion of SVL or VSp were affinity purified as follows. Dialysis precipitate (10 pg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane as described below. The regions of the nitrocellulose membrane containing VSP or SVL peptides were excised and treated to remove carbohydrate epitopes (Woodward et al., 1985). The membrane strip wa's incubated for 24 h in 20 mL of a solution containing 50 mM sodium acetate and 20 mM p-eriodic acid, pH 4.5. It was then washed three times with 20 mL of 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and incubated for 30 min in 20 mL of PBS containing 50 mM sodium borohydride. The membrane strip was washed three times with 20 mL of PBS, blocked in PBS plus 1% BSA overnight, and stored at -20°C. The membrane strip was used to affinity purify antibody as previously described (Smith and Fisher, 1984).\n\nProtein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) using acrylamide concentrations of 11.5% in the resolving gel and 4.5% in the stacking gel. Protein molecular mass standards used in SDS-PAGE were BSA (66 kD), ovalbumin (45 kD), glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (36 kD), trypsinogen (24 kD), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kD), and a-lactalbumin (14.2 kD). Proteins were electroblotted from gels to nitrocellulose according to the method of Towbin et al. (1979) using a TE-50 electroblotting apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h. Blotted membranes were either stained with amido black or analyzed as immunoblots (Burnette, 1981) by probing with anti-VSP or anti-SVL antibodies. Locations of antigenic proteins were visualized by incubating the membranes with goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate and staining with diaminobenzidine reagent.\n\nN-terminal amino acid of SVL subunits was determined by automated Edman degradation. Sample preparation, electrophoresis, and electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were performed according to the methods of Tranbarger et al. (1991). Microsequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 470 protein sequencer by the Laboratory for Biotechnology and Bioanalysis, Biochemistry, and Biophysics Department (Washington State University, Pullman).\n\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as previously described by Tranbarger et al. (1991) with the following modifications. The tissue was incubated overnight with gentle shaking in fixative containing 1.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 2% (v/v) formaldehyde, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, and 2 mM CaCI, and then washed three times with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.3. Tissue was embedded in LR White resin and sections (1.5 pm) were cut using a 2065 microtome (Richert Jung, Heidelberg, Germany). After mounting on microscope slides, the sections were probed with either anti-VSP antibody (diluted 1:100) or anti-SVL antibody (diluted 1:10) for 1 or 16 h, respectively, and then with colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Auroprobe-LM GAR, Amersham). Sections were silver enhanced using lntense-M (Amersham) and counterstained with safranin.\n\nSeedlings were exposed to gaseous methyl jasmonate essentially as previously described (Franceschi and Grimes, 1991). Seedlings at 10 d postgermination were exposed to atmospheric methyl jasmonate (Bedoukian Research, Danbury, CT) in sealed 10-gallon glass aquaria. After seedlings were exposed for 5 d, they were harvested, homogenized, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and SVL was determined on immunoblots.\n\nSVL-HSP was prepared by incubating 0.5 mg of purified SVL with 1.25 mg of HRP (Sigma catalog No. P-6782) for 15 h at 4°C in a solution containing 10 mM NaH,PO,, 500 mM NaCI, and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The conjugate was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCI plus 500 mM NaCl and stored at -80°C. As a control, fetuin-HRP was prepared using the same procedure.\n\nThe conjugates were used to probe protein samples (1.0 pg) dot blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Dot blots were either allowed to first air dry or immediately blocked in 50 mM NaH,PO, plus 1% BSA, pH 6.0, for 1 h. The membranes were incubated for 3 h with conjugates diluted 1:500 in 50 mM NaH2P0, plus 0.1% BSA, pH 6.0. In inhibition experiments, carbohydrates or glycoproteins were included as indicated in \"Results.\" After the incubation period, the membranes were then washed five times with 50 mM NaH,PO, containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0, and stained with diaminobenzidine reagent.\n\nStructural similarities had suggested that SVL was a member of the legume lectin family (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). We sought further evidence for this relationship by determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence of SVL. The sequences for the 21 N-terminal amino acids of the 29-and 33-kD subunits were the same, and a comparison of this sequence with those of other lectins is shown in Figure 1. Highest sequence identity occurred with SBA (63%) and the pea seed lectin (48%). Lesser homologies occurred between SVL and other legume lectins and generally involved residues highly conserved among most leguminous lectins: Ser5, Phe6, Phe', Phe\", Leu2', and GlnZ1. As previously noted for other lectins (Strosberg et al., 1986), greatest homology is found when the N terminus\n\nL 62 48 38 38 38 38 38 38 35 Figure 1.

Homologies between SVL and other vegetative lectins were similar to those observed between SVL and most seed lectins.\n\nOur preliminary experiments confirmed that preimmune serum did not react with any soybean proteins but that the crude antiserum reacted extensively with many leaf glycoproteins (data not shown). Nonspecific reaction with glycoproteins was eliminated by affinity purifying antibodies against the peptide portions of either VSP or SVL, and the reaction of these antibodies is shown in Figure 2. Staining with amido black for total protein shows the two SVL peptides and 27-kD VSP in the dialysis precipitate (lane 3).\n\nAnti-SVL antibodies reacted with SVL in the dialysis precipitate and homogenate from depodded leaves (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). We also saw a weak reaction with two minor bands that may be proteolytic products of SVL. We routinely used antibody that was affinity purified against both SVL subunits; however, if only the 33-kD SVL subunit was used for affinity purification, the antibodies still reacted with both SVL subunits (data not shown), indicating a close structural relationship between these subunits. Antigenic similarity between SVL and SBA had been previously noted (Spilatro and Anderson, 1989), and we see further evidence for this relationship in the reaction of anti-SVL antibody with SBA (lane 7).\n\nAnti-VSP antibodies identified the 27-kD VSP peptide in the dialysis precipitate (lane 1) and both VSP peptides in homogenate from depodded leaves (lane 2). The anti-VSP antibody tended to react more strongly with the smaller VSP peptide, although in many samples this peptide occurred in greater abundance.\n\nSince the presence of SVL in plant organs other than leaves has not been previously examined, we compared\n\n29-Kd VSP-' 27-Kd VSP-Kd -66.0 -14.2 1 5 6 7\n\nFigure 2. Reaction of affinity-purified anti-VSP and anti-SVL antibodies. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, which were stained with amido black for total protein (lanes 3 and 4) or probed with either anti-SVL antibody (lanes 5, 6, and 7) or anti-VSP antibody (lanes 1 and 2). Lanes 1, 3, and 5 contain dialysis precipitate (10 /xg); lanes 2, 4, and 6 contain leaf homogenate from depodded plants (100 jig of protein). Lane 7 contains SBA (10 jxg).\n\ndistributions of SVL and VSP. Tissue homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either anti-SVL (Fig. 3, top) or anti-VSP (Fig. 3, bottom) antibodies. The relative levels of SVL approximately paralleled those of VSP in the different tissues, although VSP was consistently present at much higher levels than SVL. In depodded plants, VSP and SVL were present in stems and petioles and at lower levels in roots. Both proteins were present in relatively low levels in cotyledons and seed pods, but neither SVL nor VSP was found in immature or mature seeds. A weak reaction of anti-SVL antibody with SBA was observed in seed homogenates. Copyright © 1996 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Thus, it was of interest to examine the cellular location of SVL in leaves. Sections of leaf tissue from plants at anthesis were embedded in LR White resin and probed with anti-SVL or anti-VSP antibodies. The location of bound antibodies was visualized with colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody and silver enhancement. No staining occurred on leaf sections probed with preimmune serum (Fig. 4A). For leaf sections probed with anti-SVL (Fig. 4B) or anti-VSP (Fig. 4C), silver staining occurred extensively in the vacuole of bundle-sheath and paraveinal mesophyll cells. Neither VSP nor SVL was detected in the palisade mesophyll or spongy mesophyll. Both antibodies reacted sporadically with cells of the epidermis, an observation previously reported for VSP (Huang et al., 1991).\n\nSeveral types of plant treatments that disrupt the normal transport of photoassimilates to sink tissues have been shown to cause an accumulation of VSP in leaves (Wittenbach, 1983). We compared the responses of SVL (Fig. 5, top) and VSP (Fig. 5, bottom) in leaves and cotyledons to the removal of sink tissues. Both proteins were present in leaves at anthesis. The amount of SVL was lower in plants allowed to set seed normally and higher in plants subjected to pod removal. This response pattern was very similar to that observed for VSP; the level of VSP in leaves was highest in depodded plants and lowest in plants allowed to set seed normally, as previous observed (Wittenbach, 1983).\n\nFigure 5 also shows the effects of sink deprivation on levels of SVL and VSP in cotyledons. VSP and SVL were present in the cotyledons of seedings allowed to develop normally for 10 d postemergence. In seedlings, the developing shoot and leaflets represent major sink tissues for nutrient reserves stored in the cotyledons. When the developing shoot and axial buds of seedlings were removed shortly after seed germination, the levels of VSP and SVL in the cotyledons were higher than in controls after the same growth period.\n\nPreviously it was shown that the plant growth regulator methyl jasmonate causes induction of VSP gene expression and accumulation of VSP proteins (Anderson et al., 1989;Franceschi and Grimes, 1991;Staswick et al., 1991). Figure 6 shows extracts of leaves, cotyledons, and stems of seedlings exposed to different concentrations of atmospheric methyl jasmonate. SVL levels were elevated in seedlings exposed to methyl jasmonate as low as 4 ju,L L\" 1 , although in stems a slightly stronger response occurred at 8 /nL L\" 1 . The amount of SVL began to diminish in plants exposed to 12 ju,L L\" 1 methyl jasmonate, which may be due to the 33-Kd SVL-28-Kd SVL-. 29-Kd VSP -27-Kd VSP^K d '-36.0 -24.0 S -36.0 -24.0 Leaf Cotyl Figure 5. Effects of sink deprivation (Sink Depr) on accumulation of SVL and VSP. SVL and VSP were detected by subjecting tissue homogenates (100 jug of protein) to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The presence of SVL and VSP was determined by probing nitrocellulose membranes with either anti-SVL antibody (top) or anti-VSP antibody (bottom).

We examined whether high-molecular-weight aggregates of SVL or VSP were present in homogenates prior to ammonium sulfate treatment. Crude leaf homogenates were subjected to gel-permeation chromatography, and the composition of the column fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The proteins eluted from the column as a series of broad peaks (Fig. 7A).

However, SVL was found only in the void volume fractions (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2). The void volume also contained the 27-kD VSP (lanes 1 and 3) and peptides that correlated in molecular mass with the large (55 kD) and small (14 kD) subunits of Rubisco. Since the largest molecular mass resolved on a Superose 12-HR resin is approximately 300 kD, proteins in the void volume have molecular masses equal to or greater than 300 kD. The results presented above suggest that SVL and VSP exist in higher-molecular-weight aggregates before treatment of the proteins with ammonium sulfate but do not resolve whether they form homogenous or heterogenous aggregates. We found that purified SVL rapidly precipitates out of solution in the absence of VSP, apparently through self-association. However, we did not observe high-molecular-weight aggregates of VSP when purified VSP was subjected to gel-permeation chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, we did not find that precipitates formed in solutions of purified VSP at concentra- The fractions from the void volume were pooled, and a sample (20 jitg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The electroblotted samples were stained for total protein with amido black (lane 1) or probed for antigenic proteins with either anti-SVL antibody (lane 2) or anti-VSP antibody (lane 3).\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from\n\nCopyright © 1996 American Society of Plant Biologists.

These observations suggest that occurrence of VSP in the dialysis precipitate is dependent on the presence of SVL.\n\nTo test for direct binding between SVL and VSP, SVL-HRP was prepared and used to probe VSP and other proteins dot blotted on nitrocellulose. As shown in Figure 8A, SVL-HRP reacted with both VSP and SVL. When dot blots were not allowed to dry during the probing procedure, the conjugate reacted more strongly with SVL than VSP. Binding to VSP was greatly enhanced, however, if the protein blots were allowed to air dry prior to the blocking step.\n\nA number of controls were run to examine the specificity of the SVL-HRP reactions. The absence of background staining on the immunoblots showed that SVL-HRP did not react with nondried BSA, a nonglycosylated protein used as the blocking agent (Figs. 8 and 9). SVL-HRP also did not react with the glycoproteins fetuin and ovalbumin on dried or nondried blots, and unconjugated HRP did not react with SVL or VSP (data not shown). Fetuin-HRP did not react detectably with nondried VSP or SVL, although a slight reaction with dried VSP blots was observed (Fig. 8A).\n\nDrying of the blots probably caused protein denaturation, possibly exposing hydrophobic sites to which the conjugate bound. The role of hydrophobic sites was examined by probing heat-denatured BSA, a protein that does not possess bound carbohydrates. As noted above, SVL-HRP did not bind to untreated BSA used as a blocking agent. However, when BSA was heat treated and then blotted, binding of SVL-HRP was observed (Fig. 8B).\n\nInhibition of the reaction of SVL-HRP with VSP and SVL was tested using a range of carbohydrates and glycoproteins. Figure 9A shows that binding was not affected by the presence of Glc, Man, a-methyl-D-mannopyranoside, Gal, N-acetylgalactose-amine, N-acetylglucose-amine, or Fuc at 10 mM. These carbohydrates had no effect whether or not VSP blots were dried.

In the experiment shown, protein blots were allowed to dry before blocking, although similar results were obtained when blots were not allowed to dry. Partial inhibition of binding to VSP was detected at concentrations of mucin and heparin as low as 1 jiig/mL. Higher concentrations of these substances were required to inhibit binding of SVL-HRP to SVL, possibly reflecting a stronger affinity of SVL for itself than for the inhibitors. The effect of N-desulfated heparin (Sigma catalog No. D-4776) was similar to that of heparin.\n\nA number of other proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of SVL-HRP to blots. Binding was not inhibited when BSA, ovalbumin, fetuin, or bovine submaxillary gland mucin were present at 1 mg/mL (data not shown).\n\nA comparison of the N-terminal sequences of SVL and SBA indicates that these proteins are products of distinct, yet closely related, genes. Along with previously reported structural and immunological relationships (Spilatro andPlant Physiol. Vol. 110, 1996 Anderson, 1989), the sequence data strongly suggest that SVL is a member of the legume family of plant lectins. Sequence similarity varies widely between seed and vegetative lectins within legume species; for example, the seed and vegetative lectins of Dolickos biflorus and Sopkora japonica are nearly identical in primary structure (Hankins et al., 1988;Schnell and Etzler, 1988;Harada et al., 1990), whereas the pea lectins are only 38% identical (Ho Pak et al., 1992). No significant sequence homology with lectins from nonleguminous plants was observed, suggesting that SVL is not related to lectins in other plant families. Identity in N-terminal sequence between SVL subunits is similar to that reported for Dolickos lectins, which differ only at the C terminus (Etzler, 1994b).\n\nThe results of this investigation show that SVL occurs widely throughout the plant. Wide distribution among plant organs has been observed for vegetative lectins in certain other plants, such as D. biflorus and Pkaseolus vulgaris (Borrebaeck, 1984;Etzler, 1986;Pusztai, 1991). Lectins with diverse properties have been isolated from various organs of soybean plants (Pusztai, 1991), although SVL is more widely distributed than other soybean lectins. A vegetative protein of soybean plants that shares some properties with SVL and forms a complex with Rubisco has recently been described (Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 1994). This protein is widely distributed in the vegetative tissues, occurs as a tetramer of 30-kD subunits, and increases in amount when seed pods are removed. However, unlike SVL, the Rubsico-binding protein reportedly occurs in the cytosol (Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 1994).\n\nMany properties of SVL suggest that this protein is a lectin; however, neither specific carbohydrate-binding nor hemagglutination has been demonstrated. Results reported in this paper could explain why hemagglutination activity has not been observed for soluble extracts of soybean vegetative tissues or purified SVL (Pueppke et al., 1978;Bowles and Marcus, 1981;Spilatro and Anderson, 1989). For example, since SVL appears to exist in a high-molecular-mass aggregate in crude homogenates, hemagglutination activity of SVL may be masked through binding to VSP or self-association. Alternatively, SVL may be monovalent and unable to cross-link blood cells.\n\nThe ability of heparin and porcine mucin, but not simple carbohydrates, to inhibit binding of SVL-HRP to VSP and SVL suggests that SVL binds to an oligosaccharide. Many legume lectins display a higher affinity for oligosaccharides than for monosaccharides, and some seed and vegetative lectins are only known to bind to oligosaccharides (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986;Sharon and Lis, 1990). Lectins, such as those of P. vulgaris, that display a high affinity for a complex oligosaccharide structure are not readily inhibited by simple carbohydrates (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986). The vegetative lectin of D. biforus, DB58, binds to the blood group A + H substance, but not to simple carbohydrates, and does not agglutinate erythrocytes (Etzler, 1994a). SVL may not bind to the oligosaccharides exposed on the erythrocytes used in agglutination tests. Lectins from some plants agglutinate only specific types of erythrocytes (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986). This includes a lectin from tulip bulbs, which agglutinates only mouse and rat erythrocytes and cannot be inhibited by simple sugars (Oda et al., 1987) and many legume lectins (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986).\n\nEnhanced binding of SVL-HRP to dried protein blots suggests that binding of SVL to proteins involves hydrophobic interactions. Other lectins also appear to possess hydrophobic sites, as evidenced by stronger binding to hydrophobic glycosides than simple carbohydrates (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986;Strosberg et al., 1986;Sharon and Lis, 1990). These hydrophobic sites are likely to be important to the function of lectins (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986); however, little is known about the role of hydrophobic sites in the binding of plant lectins to glycoprotein receptors or the conditions that inhibit these interactions. Involvement of hydrophobic sites in the binding of SVL-HRP to VSP could explain why simple carbohydrates and oligosaccharides alone are not inhibitory. Properties unique to each of the VSP peptides might explain why only the 27-kD VSP occurs in the dialysis precipitate. VSP peptides differ in pI (Mason et al., 1988), enzymatic activity (DeWald et al., 1992), and possibly in bound carbohydrates or exposed hydrophobic sites. Binding characteristics of lectins are affected by many other factors, including the presence of ions, ionic strength, and pH (Etzler, 1986;Goldstein and Poretz, 1986), and such factors would be important to the physicochemical properties of SVL in vivo.\n\nSevera1 lines of evidence suggest that SVL and VSP may interact in vivo. Both proteins are widely distributed among the vegetative organs of the plant and accumulate in the vacuolar compartment. SVL responds to signals that are similar to those that regulate VSP. The response of VSP to sink deprivation is believed to reflect its role as a storage site for nitrogen and photosynthates (Wittenbach, 1983;Staswick, 1990). Levels of SVL are much lower than those of VSP under a11 conditions investigated, arguing against a similar function for SVL. SVL is the first lectin shown to be regulated by methyl jasmonate, which has previously been shown to regulate expression of VSP genes (Franceschi and Grimes, 1991;Mason et al., 1992). Methyl jasrnonate has been implicated in plant responses to physiological stresses such as wounding, herbivory, and water deficit (Staswick, 1992), suggesting that SVL may serve a function relating to these responses.\n\nHowever, immunohistochemical data that show that SVL occurs principally in the bundle-sheath and paraveinal mesophyll cells of leaves argue that SVL relates to the specialized function of these cells. The paraveinal mesophyll and associated bundle sheath make up a specialized tissue believed to play an important role in the storage and transfer of photoassimilates (Franceschi and Giaquinta, 1983). It has been suggested that lectins may function in the packaging or remobilization of storage proteinis, and seed lectins have been shown to form complexes with some seed storage proteins (Clarke et al., 1975;Bowles and Marcus, 1981;Einhoff et al., 1986). Conceivably, SVL could contribute to the packaging of VSP in vacuoles. It will be necessary to further characterize the binding properties of SVL and covalently bound carbohydrates of VSP to evaluate this possibility .\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1996 American Society of Plant Biologists.
