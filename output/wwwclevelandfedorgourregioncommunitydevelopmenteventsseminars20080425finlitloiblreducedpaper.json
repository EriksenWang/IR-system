There was a much lower percentage who answered none/one question or six to nine questions correctly.\n\nix Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nBusiness Education teachers were more likely to teach elective courses, to teach tax-related topics, and to have a higher percentage of male students in their personal finance classes. On the other hand, their courses were less likely to be limited to one semester and they used less classroom time to teach personal finance compared to the other academic content areas. They were less likely to teach goal setting and limited-resource topics, and were most likely to score high on the personal finance quiz. They were curious about learning personal finance and attached great significance to teaching these topics.\n\nTheir main barrier to teaching personal finance topics was their school's administration. None of the subject-matter barriers were pertinent for this content area. In fact, Business Education teachers were even less likely to cite curriculum needs and student ignorance as challenges for teaching personal finance compared to the other academic content areas. Those teaching personal finance were less likely to be female and to participate in continuing education courses, but were more likely to have taken college courses on personal finance.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were more likely to teach credit, budgeting, and goal-setting, while they avoided the investment topic. They were most likely to be teaching personal finance in an elective course offered on a onesemester schedule with ample time spent on this topic. Their audience was less likely to be male. These teachers expressed high diligence in researching personal finance topics and were highly likely to belong to either the high or moderateinformation search types of teachers. Surprisingly, they tended to score low on the knowledge quiz and to dislike the Internet as a source of information on personal finance topics.\n\nTheir main challenges in teaching personal finance were a lack of curricula that fit their teaching needs and the lack of student interest. School administration and classroom materials were less likely to present barriers to this content area. Overall, they attached less significance to teaching these topics than did Business Education or Science teachers.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were most likely to be female, older, and living in households with a higher household income. Most likely, they had been teaching personal finance for a number of years supported by continuing education courses. This group of teachers was less likely to hold a Masters' degree.\n\nSocial Studies teachers were most likely to teach investment, tax, and limited-resources topics. They stayed away from teaching budgeting and interest-related topics. They were more likely to teach a large number of students in Grade 12, to devote significant time to these topics, and to follow a onesemester course schedule. Their courses were least likely to be elective compared to the other academic content areas.\n\nThis group of teachers attached little significance to teaching personal finance topics and the group members were less likely to diligently research personal finance topics. They were unlikely to belong to the high-or moderate-search types of teachers for personal finance information. They did indicate that they like to talk to colleagues to prepare for teaching these topics and that their main challenges were classroom materials and classroom time to properly teach these topics.\n\nSocial Studies teachers who were teaching personal finance were least likely to be located in rural school locations, to be female, and to participate in continuing education on personal finance topics. They also reported fewer years teaching personal finance.\n\nThe group of \"Science\" teachers was more likely to focus on budgeting and to avoid teaching limited-resource related topics. While Science teachers were more likely to have a higher number of male students, their personal finance instruction was characterized by fewer students in Grade 10, the topics being spread out over fewer courses, and generally less time reserved for teaching personal finance topics.\n\nMajor survey findings by academic content area\n\nx Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nSimilar to Business Education teachers, their courses were less likely to be limited to one semester. These Science teachers attached the highest level of significance to teaching personal finance topics among the four academic content areas. While they were less likely to practice high-information search efforts to learn about personal finance, they were most likely to talk to others to prepare for teaching these topics.\n\nTheir greatest reported challenge was the feeling that teaching personal finance often seems tedious.\n\nClassroom time, in particular, was of little concern to this group. They were less likely to teach personal finance at public schools, to be female, and to hold a Masters' degree.\n\nThey reported fewer years teaching personal finance topics and were less likely to have taken college-level coursework in this area. However, they did indicate that they participate in continuing education courses.\n\nIn addition to the survey of high school teachers, a comparison of state statutes' attempts to provide high school students with financial literacy instruction was conducted.\n\nSeventeen states and one United States territory have some form of legislation concerning financial literacy in public schools.\n\n-Nine actually require financial literacy education, either as a separate course or to be integrated into existing courses.\n\n-Rather than mandating the inclusion of financial literacy, six states encourage school districts to provide financial education by requiring the state's education agency to set academic standards, create financial literacy curricula, or provide resources for disseminating financial education.\n\n-Finally, three states have enacted laws that merely require the state's education board to accumulate information on financial literacy programs or require an entity to conduct studies about need for financial literacy instruction.\n\n- Major findings of a comparison of state statutes' attempts to provide students with financial literacy instruction\n\nFollowing Greenspan (2005), we argue that financial education should be a necessary part of the high school curriculum, given the increasing sophistication of, and technological changes in, the financial industry, as well as the abundance of financial products and services available to consumers. Consumers can only avail themselves of the many products and opportunities offered in financial markets if they have the ability to research and understand the products, and the ability to take advantage of the existing technologies.\n\nHaving this knowledge protects consumers from predatory and illegal practices and also empowers them in financial decision-making.\n\nDespite the importance generally assigned to financial education in high schools (see, e.g., 126th Ohio General Assembly, 2006a, , 2006b, , 2006c, , 2006d, , 2006e;Greenspan, 2005) no information is available about the extent of personal finance instruction in Ohio. By demonstrating the scope and determinants of personal finance instruction in Ohio high schools via survey research and a comparison of legislative initiatives and financial literacy programs via a literature review and scenario analysis, the current study increases the understanding of personal finance education in Ohio.\n\nIn particular, this study furthers financial literacy research, aids school administrators and teachers interested in expanding the scope of personal finance topics offered in schools, and buttresses legislative efforts to require personal finance instruction in Ohio schools.\n\nThis project has three specific objectives:\n\n1. Determine what personal finance topics are taught at Ohio high schools, which teachers are teaching it, and which students attend the classes (Objective 1).\n\n2. Determine the personal finance education and knowledge of high school teachers and their sources of information (Objective 2). The method for achieving Objective 3a consisted of a metaanalysis of existing laws and proposed legislation in the United States which mandate or require personal financial literacy topics be incorporated in P to 12 schools. The findings of the legislative analysis are presented in Part II of this report.\n\nThe current report represents a unique collaboration among faculty members from five OSU academic units. The six project members have special expertise and extensive experience in studying financial education. With the ultimate goal of providing insight on the scope and determinants of personal finance education in Ohio high schools, this project is consistent with the P to12 Project's mission to \"assist in the improvement of Ohio's schools\" and its goals to \"initiate, incubate, and support projects closely aligned with school improvement\" and to \"develop and sustain an ongoing relationship with the thirteen university-area schools . \"\n\nFinancial education should be a necessary part of the high school curriculum.\n\nDeliverables and outcomes from this project include the here presented report providing:\n\n-Quantitative information about the when, where, who, and how of personal finance instruction in Ohio high schools;\n\n-Quantitative information about the student population attending personal finance courses;\n\n-Knowledge of Ohio high school teachers' personal finance knowledge and the sources they use to stay informed of personal finance topics;\n\n-A comprehensive manual of financial literacy programs used by high school teachers in Ohio and organizations which offer train-the-teacher programs across Ohio; and -Knowledge of the key actors and status of legislative efforts to achieve legislation mandating effective financial education in schools.\n\nThe present findings are currently in preparation for conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nPart I\n\nPart I:\n\nSurvey of High School Teachers in Ohio Schools By Cäzilia Loibl, Assistant Professor Department of Consumer Sciences, The Ohio State University\n\nThis study presents a response to the call for financial education in high schools by examining the current state of instruction in Ohio high schools. Specifically, the study objectives were to provide:\n\n1. Quantitative information about the when, where, who, and how of personal finance instruction in Ohio high schools;\n\n2. Quantitative information about the student population attending personal finance courses;\n\n3. Knowledge of Ohio high school teachers' personal finance knowledge and the sources they use to stay informed of personal finance topics; and 4. A manual of financial literacy programs used by high school teachers in Ohio and the organizations which offer train-the-teacher programs across Ohio.\n\nThe\n\nWe used the maximum likelihood estimation\n\n(MLE) procedure to replace missing values in the data set. This method, implemented by the EM algorithm, applies MLE to the task of imputing missing data values without recourse to the simulation involved in multiple imputation. MLE makes fewer demands of the data in terms of statistical assumptions and is generally considered superior to imputation by multiple regression. This is now the most common method of imputation. The MLE method assumes that missing values are \"missing at random\". Number of survey responses 0 200 400 600 800 Taught in 2006/2007 Did not teach in 2006/2007 (invalid) Postcard 1 Postcard 2 (day 6) and Press Release Postcard 3 (day 23) The results section presents the analyses of the survey data and summarizes the findings for four academic content areas. This section consists of six parts: 1. Description of the teachers and their students in personal finance courses, 2. Factor analyses to identify the personal finance topics taught in class and teachers' attitudes toward teaching personal finance, 3. Cluster analysis to identify teachers' efforts in staying informed about personal finance topics, 4. Financial knowledge score compiled of respondents' answers to the nine quiz questions 5. Regression analysis to identify the influence of the measures defined in Parts 1 to 4 on personal finance instruction in four academic content areas, and 6. Academic content area scores for the main measures as identified in Parts 1 to 4. Survey participants provided us with a wealth of comments and suggestions in an open-ended question at the end of the survey. This feedback is presented in Appendix 3.\n\nA detailed descriptive analysis of the survey findings is presented in Appendix 5.\n\nThe data collection focused on teachers who are teaching\n\n(1) business education, (2) family and consumer sciences, and (3) social studies in one or more four high school grades. A total of 63 respondents taught in other academic content areas. Of those teachers, 40 were somewhat similar in that they taught \"science\" courses, including teachers in the following sections: Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Agricultural Sciences. We included this group as an additional academic content area into our analysis. Although the group is small, with only 40 teachers, we felt that they provide an additional perspective in the analysis of personal finance instruction in Ohio.\n\nThe remaining 23 responses came from teachers in the remaining academic content areas (e.g., Fine Arts, English Language) and from teachers in counseling, elementary education, and vocational education. This group was too diverse to allow for useful interpretation. As a result, these 23 responses were excluded from the analyses. Therefore, the working sample for the current analyses consisted of 687 teachers; the total responses were 710 (see Figure 2).\n\nThe titles of the courses in which these teachers wereteaching personal finance topics are summarized in Appendix 1.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we describe the characteristics of the student population (Table 1), the specifics of personal\n\nDescription of teachers and their students in personal finance courses Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nfinance instruction in high schools (Table 2), and the school and teacher demographics (Table 3). We present the descriptive data divided into the four academic content areas.\n\nA number of differences emerged, which we describe in detail in the following sections.\n\nTwo important differences emerge between the four academic content areas with respect to the student population enrolled in their personal finance courses.\n\nSpecifically, the questionnaire inquired for the number of student in personal finance classes at each grade level.\n\nTeachers were asked to add up the number of students for each grade level if they taught more than one personal finance class at one grade level. The results are presented in\n\nTable 1. Our major finding was that Social Studies teachers instructed, by far, the largest classes in Grades 11 and 12 in personal finance. They taught, on average, 20 juniors and 36 seniors compared to the overall average across the four academic content areas of 13 and 15, respectively. In Grade 10, Family and Consumer Sciences teachers had larger classes (12 students on average), while Social Science teachers had the second largest classes (9 students on average). Second, the number of male students differed among the academic content areas. The number of male students was highest in the Science area (55% on average) and lowest in Family and Consumer Sciences courses (39% on average).\n\nThe academic content areas did not differ with respect to minority students (14% on average), student grades (93% will attain a \"C\" on average), ESL/ELL students (5% on average), nor with respect to teacher expectations about how many of their personal finance students will graduate with a high school diploma (94% on average) or will enter college (62% on average).\n\nAcademic Content Areas of the Sample (N=710)\n\nThe majority of personal finance instruction was offered by three academic content areas: Family and Consumer Sciences, Business Education, and Social Studies .\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Agricultural Sciences Social Studies Other Business Education 6% 20% 33% 3% 38% Results Table 1 Sample characteristics: Student population Significant differences among academic content areas are shadowed .

The questionnaire inquired about conditions related to the number of courses taught with personal finance content, the course layout, teachers' course preparation, and the challenges of teaching personal finance. The findings are summarized in Table 2. Overall, Family and Consumer Sciences teachers taught personal finance topics in the most number of courses (1.8 courses; overall sample average: 1.7), while Business Education teachers invested the most instruction time on personal finance topics (61% of their courses; average: 59%). In most schools, personal finance was an elective, one-semester long course. This was particularly true for the Family and Consumer Sciences academic content area, with 88 percent elective (opposite end: Social Studies: 31%) and 77 percent one-semester coursework (opposite end: Science: 25%). The academic content areas did not differ with respect to teaching personal finance in a traditional course schedule (average: 81%) or in the frequency of class meetings (average: 4.8 times per week). When teachers prepared for their personal finance courses, they differed in their sources of information they preferred to gather information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance. About 45 percent of Science teachers' reported the Internet as their preferred source of information (average: 38%), while they spent the least amount of time searching the Internet on personal finance topics to prepare for one class period (19.5 min.; average: 29.1 min.). Just the contrary was true for Family and Consumer Sciences teachers. They spent the most time searching the Internet to prepare, on average, for one class period of their personal finance courses (32.1 min.), and were least likely to choose the Internet as their preferred source for gathering information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance (32%). Family and Consumer Sciences teachers also spent the most time talking to others about personal finance topics (15.0 min.; average: 10.5 min.; tied with Science teachers) and on assembling materials to prepare for one class period (40.2 min.; average: 32.7 min.). The academic content areas exhibited similar patterns with respect to reading publications about personal finance (average: 20.4 min. per class period). Asked about what they felt were the major challenges when teaching personal finance, differences between the academic content areas emerged for seven of the nine presented challenges. Business education teachers were most likely to cite a disinterest of the school administration (26%; average: 18%), and were least likely to report about lacking subjectmatter knowledge (6%; average: 16%), curricula needs (12%, average: 20%), classroom materials (29%, average: 39%), and student interest (20%; average: 27%). They were least likely to consider teaching personal finance to be a \"tedious task\" (12%; average: 18%). Family and Consumer Sciences teachers reported the highest concerns for not having enough subject-matter knowledge (21%) and suitable curricula (26%), and had the strongest concerns about student interest in the topic (35%). Social Studies teachers were most likely to mention a lack of classroom materials (51%) and classroom time (56%; average: 42%) to properly teach personal finance topics. Finally, the\n\nScience teachers were the most likely to consider teaching personal finance to be a \"tedious task\" (25%) and were more likely to report a lack of suitable curricula (25%) and classroom materials (50%). They were least likely to report lacking classroom time (23%) and inferences of their school's administration (13%) as major challenges.\n\nInterestingly, the academic content areas expressed equal concerns about the information overload (average: 29%) and a lack of time available to stay current with changes in personal finance (average: 30%).\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the three major challenges across the four academic content areas were: (1) the lack of classroom time to properly teach personal finance topics (average: 42%),\n\n(2) the lack of classroom materials, such as lesson plans and student handouts (average: 39%), and (3) the lack of time to stay current with changes in personal finance (average: 30%).\n\nThe survey instrument inquired about survey respondents' school demographics, teaching experience, and their demographic characteristics. The school and teacher demographic variables differed significantly for the four academic content areas (see\n\nTable 3). Business Education teachers had the highest level of formal education (73% Masters; average: 67%) and reported the highest number of college courses taken on personal finance (2.7 courses; average: 2.3 courses). They were second in line, behind Family and Consumer Sciences teachers, with respect to teaching at public schools (93%), being female (62%), and slightly older (44 yrs.). They reported the second-highest annual household income ($71,600) and the second-longest career teaching personal finance (12.5 yrs.). Family and Consumer Sciences teachers were most likely to be located in public schools (94%; average 90%) and in rural school locations (57%; average 53%). A teacher in the Family and Consumer Sciences academic content area was most likely to be female (99%; average: 67%). This group was the oldest, on average (48 years; average: 45 years), with the highest annual household income ($80,400; average: $72,800)\n\nand the longest time teaching personal finance (17.0 years; average: 13.2 years). They were the most likely to report having taken CEU courses (84%; average: 63%).\n\nTeachers teaching personal finance in the Social Studies content area were least likely to teach in rural school locations (42%) and to be female (26%). They were the youngest group (40.2 yrs.). Social Studies teachers had lower educational backgrounds (61% Masters), lower annual household income ($63,400), fewer years teaching personal finance (9.2 yrs.), and were less likely to have taken college-level courses (1.9 courses). In addition, they collected the fewest CEUs (37%).\n\nThe group of Science teachers, while more likely to teach in rural locations (55%) and to collect CEUs (58%), was least likely to teach personal finance in public schools (76%), and had the lowest level of formal education (53% Masters) and household income ($63,200). These teachers had the shortest history of teaching personal finance (6.6 yrs.) and had taken the fewest college-level courses (1.6 courses) compared to teachers in the three other content areas. They were also less likely to be female (33%) and were younger (41.3 yrs.).\n\nThe four academic content areas participated in a multitude of continuing education courses to stay current on personal finance topics and teaching methods. The content of their continuing education courses on personal finance and the institutions used for continuing education in personal finance are summarized in Appendix 4.\n\nSurvey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools The four academic content areas differed significantly by school demographics, teacher experience in teaching personal finance topics, and teacher demographic characteristics . Significant differences among the four academic content areas are shadowed .\n\nFactor analysis was used to develop measures for two sections of the questionnaire: (1) the personal finance topics taught by survey respondents, and (2) their attitudes toward teaching personal finance. Eight factors were obtained for the most common topics taught in personal finance courses and four factors were obtained for teacher attitudes toward teaching personal finance.\n\nThe survey instrument included a list of 58 personal finance topics adapted from the NEFE High School Financial Planning\n\nProgram (National Endowment for Financial Education, 2007).\n\nThe topics addressed the following five themes in personal finance instruction: (1) financial planning, goal setting, and decision making; (2) budgeting;\n\n(3) savings and investments;\n\n(4) consumer credit; and (5) insurance.\n\nAll single 58 topics, measured on a 1 = \"do cover\", 0 = \"do not cover\" scale, were factor analyzed to verify the stability of the five original themes. To this end, we employed principal components method and the Varimax rotation. Item loadings under each factor in the rotated component matrix were then examined for reliability using Cronbach's alpha. Separate reliability analyses were conducted for each topic factor for each of the four academic content areas. Unsatisfactory items were removed and the factor analysis then repeated with the remaining items. The procedure was repeated four times, after which the final factor solution emerged. It included 38 of the original 58 items.\n\nAs presented in Table 4, a total of eight factors were obtained.\n\nThis result extends and rearranges the original five themes to a total of eight. A new label was developed for each of the eight factors based on the mix of the items that loaded on the said factor. Eigenvalues for the independent factors were all greater than one and all item loadings were in excess of the 0.50 threshold. Three-quarters of the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients were greater than 0.70, but one was below the 0.60 threshold.\n\nThe eight themes that emerged via factor analysis reflect the following themes and are composed of the following specific items:\n\n-Credit:\n\nComparing credit offers; Grace period; Benefits of credit; Credit report, history, score; Balance transfers on credit cards; Types of loans; Credit cards, fees, and charges; APR; Minimum balances, charges, fees at financial institutions; Identity theft; -Investing: Growth investments; Diversification of a portfolio; Fixed-income investments; Risk and return of investments; Impact of inflation and taxes on return; Stock market simulation games; -Insurance: Deductible; Insurance premium; Auto insurance types of coverage; Factors affecting costs of auto policies; Future insurance needs; Concept of insurance; -Taxes: Federal income tax, State income tax; Social Security tax, Medicare tax; Forms W-4, W-2, 1040; Payroll deductions; -Budget: Record keeping; Tracking money, spending record; Building a budget; Transaction services; -Goals: Short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals; Setting goals; Needs vs. wants; -Interest: Compounding interest; Earned interest; Rate of return; -Limited-Resources: Living with limited resources; Delayed gratification.\n\nSurvey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 4 Factors for topic-related variables\n\nEight commonly taught themes emerged from the factor analysis of 58 single personal finance topics .\n\nFactors, reliabilities a (all groups; 1, 2, 3, 4) b , items Factor loadings Credit ( .906;.916,.879,.904,.885)\n\ncredit offers .784 Grace period .750 Benefits of credit .719 Credit report, history, score .707 Balance transfers on credit cards .668 Types of loans .627 Credit cards, fees and charges .658 APR .583 Minimum balances, charges, fees at financial institutions .570 Identity theft .544 Investing ( .874; .870, .842, .827, .859) Growth investments .837 Diversification of a portfolio .819 Fixed-income investments .765 Risk and return of investments .758 Impact of inflation and taxes on return .676 Stock market simulation games .619 Insurance ( .929; .942, .931, .900, .921) Deductible .837 Insurance premium .823 Auto insurance types of coverage .811 Factors affecting costs of auto policies .788 Future insurance needs .737 Concept of insurance .716 Taxes ( .851; .883, .858, .789, .862) Federal income tax, State income tax .855 Social Security tax, Medicare tax .867 Forms W-4, W-2, 1040 .732 Payroll deductions .693 Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools Results Factors, reliabilities a (all groups; 1, 2, 3, 4) b , items Factor loadings Budget ( .739; .645, .688, .758, .491) Record keeping .756 Tracking money, spending record .703 Building a budget .556 Transaction services .521 Goals ( .700; 742, .641, .603, .827) Short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals .805 Setting goals .803 Needs vs. wants .557 Interest ( .832; .857, .807, .796, .900) Compounding interest .718 Earned interest .680 Rate of return .588 Limited-Resources ( .607; .692, .577, .452, .688) Living with limited resources .808 Delayed gratification .713 N = 687; All items measured on a 1 = \"do cover\", 0 = \"do not cover\" scale, Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis; Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization; Rotation converged in 7 iterations; Total variance explained: 66.154%; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy: .933; Bartlett's Test of Sphericity: Table 4 Factors for topic-related variables\n\nEight commonly taught themes emerged from the factor analysis of 58 single personal finance topics .\n\nTable 5 and Figure 4 present the differences among the four academic content areas in teaching the eight personal finance themes that emerged from the factor analysis.\n\nBusiness Education teachers reported highest scores in teaching insurance, taxes, and interest-related topics compared to the other three academic content areas.

A total of 28 attitudinal statements, measured on a 1 = \"strongly disagree\" to 5 = \"strongly agree\" scale, were factor analyzed using the same procedure as described for the topic factors.\n\nThe procedure was repeated five times, after which the final factor solution emerged. It included 18 of the original 28 items.\n\nAs presented in Table 6, four factors were obtained. A label was developed for each factor based on the mix of the items that loaded on the said factor. Eigenvalues for the independent factors were all greater than one and all item loadings were in excess of the 0.60 threshold. All but one of the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients were greater than the 0.70 threshold.\n\nThe four factors that emerged via factor analysis reflect the following themes and are composed of the following specific items:\n\n- Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 6 Factors for attitudinal variables Factors, reliabilities a (groups 1, 2, 3, 4) b , items Factor loadings Curiosity ( .795, .826, .866, .772) When I am looking for information or classroom materials for my personal finance course(s), I search a lot. .784 I spend a lot of time comparing information and classroom materials from different sources. .780 I regularly change the sources of information and classroom materials I use for my personal finance course(s). .710 I use many information sources for my personal finance course(s). .691 I enjoy searching for information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance. .668 I enjoy exploring new places for information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance. .618 Overload ( .866, .799, .832, .886) Deciding which financial information and classroom materials to use is overwhelming. .831 I often feel confused by all the information available on personal finance. .823 The more I get into teaching personal finance, the harder it seems to choose the best information and classroom materials. .782 There are too many different sources to consider for gathering information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance. .748 Deciding which information and classroom materials to use requires a great deal of thought. .672 Significance ( .758, .773, .789, .857) For me, teaching personal finance topics is satisfying. .845 For me, teaching personal finance topics is enjoyable. .804 For me, teaching personal finance topics is important. .739 Diligence ( .760, .704, .671, .895) It pays to select the best source of information and classroom materials for teaching personal finance. .856 The process of selecting an information source and classroom materials for my personal finance course(s) is important to me. .775 N = 687; All items measured on 5-point scales, anchored by 1=strongly agree, 5=strongly disagree; Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis; Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization; Rotation converged in 5 iterations; Total variance explained: 64.328%; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy: .850; Bartlett's Test of Sphericity: Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 7 and Figure 5 illustrate the four academic content areas' attitudes toward teaching personal finance. Using the four attitudes that emerged from the factor analysis, we found that the four areas differed significantly for all but the \"information overload\" measure. Business Education teacher scored highest with respect to all four attitudes. However, the trend line is clear: Teachers scored highest with respect to their diligence in researching personal finance topics for class, they attached relatively high significance to this topic, and were somewhat curious about it. The feeling of information overload was low and not significant for the four groups.\n\nTable 7 Strength of teacher attitudes toward teaching personal finance\n\nThe four academic content areas differed significantly in their curiosity toward teaching personal finance, the significance they attached to these topics, and the diligence in researching them .

These patterns served as the dependent measures in the regression analyses in the subsequent sections of the current study. A total of 38 information-source variables were used to build the clusters.\n\nUsage of the sources was measured with the question, \"How frequently do you use each of the following to stay informed about personal finance topics?\" Responses were rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = \"never\" to 5 = \"very often\".\n\nInformation sources included:\n\n-Eight mass-media sources, -Fourteen Internet-based sources, -Twelve interpersonal sources, and -Four professional sources.\n\nFor the cluster analysis, we employed the k-means clustering technique with the software SPSS 14.0 for Windows. This is considered the most robust clustering technique in a review of different clustering applications (Punj & Stewart, 1983). Our process was facilitated by the survey design, which measured these variables on the same five-point Likert scale (anchored by 1 = \"never\", 5 = \"always\").\n\nFollowing a procedure described in Schneider and Roberts (2004), we employed a multi-step cluster analysis process.\n\nStarting the cluster analysis with a two-cluster solution, we one-by-one increased the number of clusters to eight. At each step of our analysis, we observed the indicators for valid and reliable cluster solutions, including quantitative indicators, such as iteration history, distance between cluster centers, and analysis of variance, to seek high and statistically significant F values, as well as qualitative indicators, such as the structural meaning of constructs within clusters (Aldenderfer & Blashfield, 1984;Henry, Tolan, & Gorman-Smith, 2005).\n\nThe three-cluster solution proved to be the best solution. It included statistically significant, high F values in the ANOVA, satisfying distances between final cluster centers ranging from 1.95 to 2.99, and an iteration history reaching an endpoint at the 13th iteration. The cluster centers and the ANOVA results are presented in Table 8. The three information clusters differ in how often they used the information sources, from a high of 2.99 (Cluster 1) to a low of 1.95 (Cluster 3) and the number of sources used, ranging from all 38 sources (Cluster 1), 37 sources (Cluster 2), to 27 sources (Cluster 3).\n\nSurvey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 8 Cluster centers and ANOVA results for teacher information sources 38 sources of personal finance information and the frequency of their usage were clustered to identify high-, moderate-, and lowinformation strategies among teachers .\n\nCluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 F Statistics a Mass-media sources Television programs 4 3 39.395 Radio programs 3 3 11.026 Books 3 3 37.801 Personal finance textbooks 4 3 18.950 General newspapers 4 3 30.814 Financial newspapers 3 2 113.810 Financial planning magazines 3 2 132.530 General interest magazines 3 3 30.706 Internet-based sources Email newsletters 2 2 85.825 Information-sharing email listservs 2 2 81.803 Browser searches 4 4 69.844 Blogs 2 1 38.526 Teacher-focused financial Web sites 3 2 118.056 Curriculum clearinghouses 3 2 100.336 Investment firms' and brokerage houses 3 2 210.555 Market watch Web sites 3 2 213.302 Personalized financial Web sites 3 2 215.557 Youth-focused Web sites 3 2 160.849 Web sites that provide access to financial 4 3 166.605 Personal finance web portals and directories 3 2 178.545 Online games and simulations 3 2 118.460 Online financial tools 4 3 172.786 Interpersonal sources Spouse 3 3 17.224 Parents 3 2 27.273 Friends and extended family 3 3 42.819 Colleagues 3 3 47.732 Workplace financial education 3 3 53.966 Investment clubs 2 2 56.785 Financial advisors 3 3 51.310 Bankers, credit union associates 3 3 88.813 Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools Results Information sources Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 F Statistics a Business leaders 3 3 2 111.566 Civic or religious leaders 2 2 1 55.934 Personal experiences 4 4 4 21.228 Stock broker 3 2 2 71.548 Professional sources Professional conferences 3 3 1 109.325 Other continuing education events 3 3 2 121.209 Jumpstart trainings and resources 2 2 1 75.880 NCEE sponsored workshops 2 2 1 53.070 Frequency of sources (SD) 2.99 2.52 1.95 Number of sources (= 38) 38 37 27 N (= 687) 260 (37.8%) 221 (32.2%) 206 30.0% Note: Variables were coded on a five-point scale: never=1, seldom=2, sometimes=3, often=4, very often=5; a) All F statistics were significant at the p < 0.001 level\n\nTable 8, continued Cluster centers and ANOVA results for teacher information sources\n\n38 sources of personal finance information and the frequency of their usage were clustered to identify high-, moderate-, and lowinformation strategies among teachers .\n\nFollowing the terminology of previous research (Claxton, Fry, & Portis, 1974;Furse, Punj, & Stewart, 1984;Kiel & Layton, 1981;Klein & Ford, 2003), we used the distances between the mean frequency of source usage to classify the following (see 1. Cluster 1 (260 respondents; 37.8 percent of the survey respondents): the high information search type of teachers practicing a multi-source, high-information strategy. These teachers were highly information-driven and use a diversified information strategy. The cluster's mean information gathering score is 2.99. 2. Cluster 2 (221 respondents; 32.2 percent of the respondents): the moderate information search type of teachers practicing a multi-source, but less frequent, information search strategy. The cluster's mean information gathering score is 2.52. 3. Cluster 3 (206 respondents; 30.0 percent of the respondents): the low information search type of teachers practicing a low-information strategy. Their major information source is personal experience. The cluster's mean information gathering score is 1.95, the lowest of the three clusters.\n\nInformation search strategies among teachers\n\nTeachers practiced high-, moderate-, and low-search strategies to stay current on personal finance topics .\n\nIn order to study the interaction between teacher knowledge and personal finance instruction, each participant was given a nine-question financial literacy exam at the end of the survey. The questions in the exam were taken directly, or were adapted, from questions asked in nationally-representative consumer surveys. We chose nine questions from seven sources to test the five personal finance themes that we also used to assess teaching priorities. Due to the comprehensive range of topics, no single questionnaire tested in the literature was available for the current survey. The knowledge quiz questions and their sources were as follows. First, only three of the nine questions were answered correctly by a majority of the teachers. In total, 86 percent of the sample knew the correct amount of FDIC insured deposits, the question with the highest number of correct answers. About half of the sample knew the amount one is responsible for when a credit card is lost (55.4%), the type of car insurance (54.4%), credit report time frames (48.6%), the current personal savings rate (46.8%), and average returns of investment products (42.6%). Only about one quarter of respondents understood the relationship between bonds and interest rates (26.6%) and the nature of index funds (24.3%). A low percentage knew about the average credit score (9.3%), the question with the lowest number of correct answers.\n\nSecondly, the academic content areas differed significantly in the number of correct answers given. Rank 1, the highest number of correct answers for a question, was achieved four times by Business Education (Questions 2, 6, 8, 9) and Social Studies teachers (Questions 1, 3, 4, 5). Family and Consumer Sciences teachers scored lowest on four of the nine questions (Questions 2, 3, 5, 8) and second-lowest on three more questions (Questions 1, 4, 9). Science teachers were ranked third place for five of the nine questions (Questions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8).\n\nThe most significant differences in correct answers among the academic content areas were observed for the lost credit card (Question 7, F=25.063), average investment return (Question 3, F=16.262), and index fund (Question 5, F=12.287) questions.\n\nSummary of quiz questions and percentage of participants who answered each question correctly.\n\nThe number of correct answers differed most significantly for, in order, Questions 7, 3, and 5 .

There was a much lower number who answered none/one question or six to nine questions correctly. With respect to the full sample, most respondents answered four questions correctly (21.1%).

We conducted four separate binary logistic regression analyses to identify the measures that influence the instruction of personal finance in each of the four academic content areas (= dependent variables). The binary logistic regression analyses allow us to predict the variance in the dependent variables explained by the independent measures, to rank the relative importance of the independent measures, and to assess interaction effects.\n\nTable 12 summarizes the results for the regression analyses that were conducted for each academic content area. A complete breakdown of the regression results for each academic content area appears in Appendix 2. In order to facilitate comparisons among the four academic content areas, the regression values of the odd ratios are expressed as positive and negative signs to indicate strength and direction of the relationship with the dependent variables. For each academic content area, the variables have been grouped into three sets: instruction [i], preparation [p], and demographics [d]. Concerning the underlying determinants of teaching personal finance in Ohio high schools, the four academic content areas exhibit differences with respect to the actual number of determinants. The Family and Consumer Sciences academic content area was found to have the highest number, with a total of 24 determinants, while the Social Studies content area had 21, the Business Education content area had 19, and the Science content area had 18 determinants. The ensuing sections describe the effects of the significant antecedent variables on teaching personal finance, with a focus on comparing the four academic content areas.\n\nWith respect to the presence and sign direction of significant predictor variables, there were few similarities among the four academic content areas. Business education teachers were more likely to teach elective courses, to teach tax topics, and to have a higher percentage of male students in their personal finance classes. On the other hand, their courses were less likely to be limited to one semester and they used less classroom time to teach personal finance. In addition, they were less likely to teach goal setting and limited-resource topics.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were more likely to teach credit, budgeting, and goal-setting but avoided the investment topic. They were most likely teaching personal finance in an elective course offered on a one-semester schedule with ample time spent on instructing it. Their audience was less likely to be male.\n\nSocial Studies teachers were most likely to teach investment, tax, and limited-resources topics. They stayed away from teaching budgeting and interest-related topics. They were more likely to teach a large number of students in Grade 12, to devote significant time to these topics, and to follow a onesemester course schedule. Their courses were least likely to be elective.\n\nSimilar to Family and Consumer Sciences teachers, Science teachers were more likely to focus on budgeting and avoided teaching limited-resource related topics. While Science teachers were more likely to have a higher number of male students, their personal finance instruction was characterized by fewer students attending personal finance courses in Grade 10, topics spread out over fewer courses, and generally had less time reserved for teaching personal finance topics.\n\nSimilar to Business Education teachers, their personal finance instruction was less likely limited to one semester.\n\nAs with the case of the instruction of personal finance, few predictor variables commonly affected class preparation among the four academic content areas. Business Education\n\nSurvey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nteachers were most likely to score high on the personal finance quiz, were curious about learning personal finance, and attached great significance to teaching these topics.\n\nTheir main barrier to teaching personal finance topics was their school's administration. None of the subject-matter barriers were pertinent for this content area. In fact, Business Education teachers were even less likely to cite curriculum needs and student ignorance as challenges for teaching personal finance compared to the other academic content areas.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers expressed high diligence in researching personal finance topics and were Science teachers attached the highest level of significance to teaching personal finance topics. While they were less likely to practice high-information search efforts to learn about personal finance, they were most likely to talk to others to prepare for teaching these topics. Their greatest challenge was the feeling that teaching personal finance often seems tedious. They were not likely to cite any of the other challenges. Classroom time, in particular, was of little concern to this group.\n\nA selected number of demographics characterize teachers' involvement in teaching personal finance. Business Education teachers were less likely to be female and to participate in continuing education courses, but were more likely to have taken college courses on personal finance.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were most likely to be female, older, and living in households with a higher household income. Most likely, they had been teaching personal finance for a number of years, supported by continuing education courses. This group was less likely to hold a Masters' degree.\n\nSocial Studies teachers who teach personal finance were least likely to be located in rural school locations, to be female, and to participate in continuing education on personal finance topics. They reported fewer years teaching personal finance.\n\nScience teachers who teach personal finance, finally, were less likely to teach personal finance at public schools, to be female, and to hold a Masters' degree. They, too, reported fewer years teaching personal finance topics and were less likely to have taken college-level coursework in this area. However, they did indicate that they participate in continuing education courses.\n\nSurvey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 12 Antecedent variable effects among academic content areas (direction of coefficient)\n\nThe red-shadowed fields indicate significantly positive relationships with the academic content area; blue indicates negative relationships .\n\nEducation Family & Consumer Sciences Social Studies Mathematics, Science, Technology, Ag Exp(B) Exp(B) Exp(B) Exp(B) [i] Teaching credit n .s . + + a) n .s . n .s .\n\n[i] Teaching investment n .s .\n\n--a) + + a) n .s .\n\n[i] Teaching tax + c) n .s . + + b) n .s .\n\n[i] Teaching budgeting n .s . + + a) --a) + + a)\n\n[i] Teaching goal setting --b) + + a) n .s . n .s .\n\n[i] Teaching interest-related n .s . n .s .\n\n--c) n .s .\n\n[i] Teaching resources topics --b) n .s .\n\n[i] Elective course + + a) + + c) --a) n .s .\n\n[i] One-semester course --a) + + a) + + a) --a)\n\n[p] Curiosity in topics + c) n .s . n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Significance of topics\n\n[p] Diligence in researching topics -c) + + a) --b) n .s .\n\n[p] High-information search n .s .\n\n[p] Moderate-information search n .s .\n\n[p] Low-information search omitted omitted omitted omitted\n\n[p] Financial knowledge quiz score + + c) --a) n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Preferred source is Internet n .s .\n\n--a) n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Talking to others -a) n .s .\n\n[p] Barrier: Classroom materials n .s .\n\n--b) + + b) n .s .\n\n[p] Barrier: Classroom time n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Barrier: School admin + b) --a) n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Barrier: Student interest -b) + + c) n .s . n .s .\n\n[p] Barrier:\n\nTedious task n .s . n .s . n .s . + + c) Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools Results Independent variables Business Education Family & Consumer Sciences Social Studies Mathematics, Science, Technology, Ag Exp(B) Exp(B) Exp(B) Exp(B) [d] Rural school location n .s . n .s . --b) n .s .

The average mean scores analysis presents a scoring tool to summarize the influence of the major measures of our analyses on teaching personal finance in the four academic content areas.\n\nTo assess the mean scores for each academic content area on the dependent variables, several MANCOVAs were conducted (Table 13). Since between-sample differences were determined for 28 variables, these variables were entered into the MANCOVA as covariates. As shown in\n\nTable 13 and Figures 9 and 10, significant differences emerged with respect to the mean average scores for all three information search types, financial knowledge scores, the topics of credit, investment, budgeting, goal-setting, and limited resources, as well as the significance and diligence attributed to teaching personal finance. Figure 9 illustrates the main effects of academic content area on reported search behaviors and financial knowledge. With respect to information search strategies, the largest group of Business Education teachers practiced a high-information strategy. Family and Consumer Sciences teachers were equally found to practice a high and moderate-search strategy. The largest group of Social Studies and Science teachers practiced a low-information strategy. Surprisingly, despite the lower search efforts, Social Studies and Business Education teachers achieved the highest scores in the financial knowledge quiz.\n\nAcademic content area scores for teaching personal finance Survey of Financial Education in Ohio's High Schools\n\nTable 13 Academic content area scores for teaching personal finance\n\nThe four academic content areas scores vary widely for the main antecedent measures of personal finance instruction .

The significance levels of these tests are designed to be more conservative than other tests in the sense that larger differences between the means are required for significance. As shown in Table 14, -Business education teacher reported higher scores in the high-information search strategy and the knowledge quiz than the three other academic content areas.\n\n-Family and Consumer Sciences teachers were less likely to teach investing and were more likely to teach goal-setting than the other three groups. Social Studies teachers were less likely to teach budgeting than the other three groups.\n\n-Business Education teachers attached higher significance to teaching personal finance than the other three groups. Games-Howell method was used to account for unequal variances (p<.050).\n\nThis research contributes to the understanding of the scope and determinants of financial education in Ohio high schools.\n\nIt was conducted at the time when the legislative body in Concerning personal finance topics taught within the four academic content areas, Family and Consumer Sciences teachers reported the highest scores for teaching goal setting, budgeting, and credit. They were least likely to teach investing among all four groups. Social Studies teachers reported the highest scores for teaching about limited resources and investing, and the lowest scores for teaching budgeting.\n\nBusiness Education teachers were most likely to cover all of the topics equally. Science teachers were least likely to teach credit, goal setting, and limited resources topics, and scored high on budgeting topics.\n\nBusiness education teachers were more likely to teach elective courses, to teach tax-related topics, and to have a higher percentage of male students in their personal finance classes. On the other hand, their courses were less likely to be limited to one semester and they used less classroom time\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were more likely to teach credit, budgeting, and goal-setting, while they avoided the investment topic. They were most likely to be teaching personal finance in an elective course offered on a onesemester schedule with ample time spent on this topic. Their audience was less likely to be male. These teachers expressed high diligence in researching personal finance topics and were highly likely to belong to either the high or moderateinformation search types of teachers. Surprisingly, they tended to score low on the knowledge quiz and to dislike the Internet as a source of information on personal finance topics.\n\nTheir main challenges in teaching personal finance were a lack of curricula that fit their teaching needs and the lack of student interest. School administration and classroom materials were less likely to present barriers to this content area. Overall, they attached less significance to teaching these topics than did Business Education or Science teachers.\n\nFamily and Consumer Sciences teachers were most likely to be female, older, and living in households with a higher household income. Most likely, they had been teaching personal finance for a number of years supported by continuing education courses. This group of teachers was less likely to hold a Masters' degree.\n\nSocial Studies teachers were most likely to teach investment, tax, and limited-resources topics. They stayed away from teaching budgeting and interest-related topics. They were more likely to teach a large number of students in Grade 12, to devote significant time to these topics, and to follow a onesemester course schedule. Their courses were least likely to be elective compared to the other academic content areas.\n\nThis group of teachers attached little significance to teaching personal finance topics and the group members were less likely to diligently research personal finance topics. They were unlikely to belong to the high-or moderate-search types of teachers for personal finance information. They did indicate that they like to talk to colleagues to prepare for teaching these topics and that their main challenges were classroom materials and classroom time to properly teach these topics.\n\nSocial Studies teachers who were teaching personal finance were least likely to be located in rural school locations, to be female, and to participate in continuing education on personal finance topics. They also reported fewer years teaching personal finance.\n\nScience teachers were more likely to focus on budgeting and to avoid teaching limited-resource related topics. While Science teachers were more likely to have a higher number of male students, their personal finance instruction was characterized by fewer students in Grade 10, the topics being spread out over fewer courses, and generally less time reserved for teaching personal finance topics. Similar to Business Education teachers, their courses were less likely to be limited to one semester. These Science teachers attached the highest level of significance to teaching personal finance topics among the four academic content areas. While they were less likely to practice high-information search efforts to learn about personal finance, they were most likely to talk to others to prepare for teaching these topics. Their greatest reported challenge was the feeling that teaching personal finance often seems tedious. They were not likely to cite any of the other barriers. Classroom time, in particular, was of little concern to this group. They were less likely to teach personal finance at public schools, to be female, and to hold a Masters' degree. They reported fewer years teaching personal finance topics and were less likely to have taken college-level coursework in this area.

I believe that it is probably one of if not the most important class many students will take. Unlike some other classes that teach \"core\"\n\nA lot of the students lack real interest because financial literacy is not relative to them at this point. They hear and do the exercises but don't seem to take the information as being what they need to know now.\n\nAfter reading the questions, I don't know as much as I should.\n\nAs a FCS teacher I have to create lessons for everything I teach -I have no textbooks that cover topics deeply or thoroughly.\n\nHowever, my class is required. I don't feel as much an expert as she is, so I stay away from topics that I don't know enough about such as the stock market.\n\nFinancial literacy is something that needs to be taught.\n\nStudents do not see the value in it unfortunately. We have to do a better job of showing them how important it is to know and to make it interesting at the same time.\n\nHaving some banking experience, I see a need for \"experts\"\n\nin the field to share what works & what doesn't work when it comes to investing. It is difficult to encourage kids to save money when the interest rates at the bank are so poor. I am in search of funds to attend a National Financial Literacy conference to be held this June in Arizona. I did apply for a grant through the University of Arizona. Unfortunately, they were overwhelmed with applications and I did not receive a grant. I believe that financial literacy education is imperative to America's future financial health. Though I feel prepared to teach the basics, I feel unprepared for the \"big\" questions students may have. I definitely need more financial literacy education! I definitely should be teaching it for a longer period of time (and updating my info). I do the best I can with what time I have to plan and prepare my 6 preps a day. I have a brief amount of time and background to teach financial ed. I bring in speakers to cover banking, investments, insurance, real estate, etc. I have never received proper personal finance education and have made major mistakes. Most of what I teach is in regards to economic standards from the state of Ohio. I need to continue to get more education in the area but I feel it is very important for all students to learn...it should be a required course (in the FCS) department. I need to learn more about stocks, but our Econ course teaches that part of curriculum. I'd like a summer course on teaching finances to High School students. I realize that I don't really know enough about finance and credit. Maybe we need actual college courses in these areas. I teach at an alternative high school which is barely funded and all teaching staff perform multiple functions. While I enjoy teaching financial literacy, I have little time to prepare. My administration is moving to change the focus of my social studies. I think it is important in the high school, but our school just made it an elective from required in our school for next year. In another year of two they are eliminating my position and we will have one section taught by the business teacher and finance education. I was completely SHOCKED at just how LITTLE students know about BASICS --like writing checks & balancing a checkbook for example! would like to attend financial and economic workshops or classes if they were offered. I think they need to help us with the topics that we should cover. There are too many people establishing standards. We should have one standard to follow. It is sad that students don't see the importance of learning it if they still live at home. It seems that they only learn it when they seem to need it and by then it really is too late. It is very important, my students need to learn about it, but I don't know where to start. Kids know very little about personal finance...parents do very little in explaining needs and wants and the basics of managing money. Materialism seems to dominate. Also, I notice a lack of knowledge from the general population about I need to learn more. \" \" We need professional development for faculty to stay current, as well as, on-going, required courses for juniors and seniors in high school. What a challenge it is time-wise and resource-wise to keep up to date. Family Consumer Science needs to keep teaching personal finance in our curriculum because we are the only department that deals with the family. With the new (in 2010) requirements, more professional development needs to be made available for educators who will be required to teach it. Most teachers find the concepts confusing and frightening for their own money, let alone the responsibility of… Would LOVE to have something basic and comprehensive to use, to generate some interest in lower functioning students! Would really appreciate professional dev. on this topic General financial literacy education As an educator, I know that there is always more for me to learn about personal finance. I have found that sharing other people's information about financial successes and woes has helped me more than anything. Basically, finance is taught in my regular class because I see how important it is and it is not taught elsewhere. I have seen some teachers are the worst financial planners. People are people. I feel the best place to start is basics in elementary school. Family and Consumer Science teachers can be a rich source of personal finance education -too often such courses are left in the hands of Social Studies Teachers who may have less training and education in these areas. GRADS is not a comprehensive financial education class but we cover several topics to help young people become My students need to learn about it, but I don't know where to start.\n\nAppendix 3\n\nindependent and we do it more on student needs. Some things we try to cover on a regular basis are wants versus needs, checking accounts, etc.\n\nI am an English teacher in her first year of teaching. When I was hired into this school, I was asked to teach a class that included information on \"real-life\" skills, such as balancing a checkbook, how to buy a house, credit cards, etc.\n\nI am surprised that more students don't take this type of a program. It is valuable information.\n\nI believe family and consumer science teachers should be considered a source of providing financial literacy instruction to meet upcoming curriculum standards.\n\nI believe FCS teachers will be able to give the family slant that will be needed for students to use the information on a daily basis over time. I think that we need to start educating more young people on this even though they find it boring.\n\nI would be interested in taking a course through OSU. I think that we need more personal financial courses for students.\n\nIn addition to our current Economics course we are adding a course in personal finance for next school year.\n\nIt is and will remain the responsibility of the public education system to make some effort in alerting, directing, and developing economic awareness for all students, they are all going to be the future consumers, whose use of currency will effect… Many of these courses have been dropped due to declining enrollment because of post-secondary, early release options and emphasis on the graduation tests in Ohio high schools.\n\nMany students in the past received this information when they took businesses courses.\n\nMy students have to face the reality of providing for a child as a teen. We have to spend time helping most of them learn to budget their resources.\n\nNeeds to be started in the early grades Next year the keyboard teacher will teach personal finance.\n\nAfter three years, the class goes to the social studies dept.\n\nWhy are we not the only ones to teach this since it all relates to family living? Why is the state dept. taking this from our curriculum?\n\nOur district is mandating teaching a course in personal finance beginning next year so I may not be teaching as much about it in 2007-2008.\n\nOur focus in Economics should be on the pitfalls that incoming college freshmen will encounter. The credit card companies are just waiting for the \"fresh fish\" to appear on campus. They should know how to organize and manage a checking account.\n\nI am surprised that more students don't take this type of a program.\n\nImportance A parent on my advisory committee shared that one of her daughter's school's greatest downfalls was that they taught her nothing about managing money.\n\nAbsolutely essential, we in FCS need to be on the front line in this endeavor.\n\nI believe financial literacy to be VERY important to today's student. I also strongly believe teaching students HOW to find information to become literate about finances to be their largest asset.\n\nI believe personal finance is extremely important, however it is not deemed necessary by school administrators. This is very frustrating to me.\n\nI believe that it is very important to teach our future business leaders about how to be knowledgeable about personal finances.\n\nI do not think we are preparing our students for the real world.\n\nFinancial literacy is not one of the \"core\" areas that students are tested on by the state, so it is not considered \"important\" by the school districts.\n\nI think it is a vital educational topic to help students understand financial situations and make good decisions for themselves in the future.\n\nI think it is very valuable to teach high school students about financial literacy so they do not go into debt.\n\nI think personal finance is one of the most important classes I teach. More resources need to get the kids interested so they realize how much they need to learn about personal finance.\n\nI think that it is very important to prepare students for the financial decisions they will be making in the future.\n\nI think that personal finance education is very important and too much overlooked.\n\nI think that teaching financial literacy is imperative for today's youth. They are hungry to learn all they can about money\n\nFinancial literacy is going by the wayside.\n\nAppendix 3 management. Personally, having answered your questions regarding financial literacy, it is apparent that I would need some retooling…\n\nIt definitely is needed. My students reside in a community of quiet wealth, but the wannabe's live way beyond their means.\n\nWe have many students living a false reality. In questioning them, most do not have a clue about money.\n\nIt is definitely needed for high school and adults. Today's parents and educational systems are not providing the information to our young people!! Credit is making it too easy for people to go into debt.\n\nIt is extremely important to be emphasized at the high school level and taught by a qualified Business teacher.\n\nIt is important that people take time to learn about personal finance in the short term so that they can save in the long term.\n\nIt is important to teach and introduce the different topics to our future leaders.\n\nIt is important! It is very much needed in the state of Ohio. I'm very happy to see that the state is addressing it at the high school level and making it required. There should be a follow-up course required of ALL college graduates of how to plan for retirement. It's important! Many young people today do not understand it. Students need to understand that credit cards can get them into financial trouble. It's very important! My Independent Living class is being eliminated (we covered other topics relating to living on your own) to be replaced by a full personal finance class to be taught through the business department. Much needed class in HS these days Next to learning how to read and being able to do basic math, financial literacy is the next most important and necessary school class.\n\nNot taught enough in schools. Should be incorporated at earlier ages, probably middle schools or maybe in some districts' intermediate schools.\n\nOur lives revolve around our finances and yet we send so many students out in the world without any knowledge of this subject matter. We need to recognize its importance and educate the public. This is a critical issue and I am the first to agree that I need to constantly learn about how to best teach this topic. This is a very important class for all students.\n\nThis subject is very important for kids to learn in school, because too many times they are not learning this info in their homes.\n\nVery important and I plan on rewriting most of the course to be able to include more finance information. Will have a new text in 2007/2008.\n\nVery important! In Ohio, too many people are defaulting on their mortgages. We need to educate them before it's too late.\n\nVery much needed at high school level.\n\nWe need lots more of it!\n\nWe need more and better.\n\nWe need more of it...I have many parents that feel there should be more classes taught on basic finance and how to handle money, etc.\n\nWe need to do more of it.\n\nIt is sorely needed in all schools.\n\nAppendix 3\n\nA course should be required for graduation.\n\nAll students should take personal finance class in high school just like everything else not all students are college material.\n\nDue to the number of foreclosures in Ohio, all students should be required to complete a personal finance course to graduate. I think it should be mandatory for all graduating seniors.\n\nI think it should be required of all students before graduating.\n\nI think that a personal finance course is needed in all high schools, especially for juniors and seniors.\n\nI wish it was required at my school.\n\nI would like to see a course in financial literacy required of all seniors. I believe that it should be taught through the Business Department, just like it would be in college.\n\nI would like to see it as a requirement to graduate. This may cut down on the amount of bankruptcies in the US.\n\nI'm not sure when, but I thought it was supposed to be becoming required in Ohio for High School graduation.\n\nIn Ohio, financial literacy education has been in the news recently as state lawmakers want to make this topic a required course for high school graduation. I completely agree.\n\nIs Ohio going to mandate a financial literacy course for high schools in the near future?\n\nIt is very important that we continue to work on making personal finance a required course in our high schools.\n\nIt needs to be mandated by the state.\n\nIt should be a required elective in all schools. It should also be taught as a separate class, not as one whose topics are included in other social studies classes which water down the meaning and students fail to grasp the importance of money.\n\nIt should be mandatory for all high school students.\n\nI believe this type of class should be required.\n\nIt should be required for every high school student.\n\nIt should be required to graduate from high school. Currently, it is offered in two different elective courses in our high school: in the business dept, and in Home and Family Services dept.\n\nMany states have personal finance courses in high school but Ohio does not. I would like for Ohio to make it mandatory.\n\nNeeds to be a requirement for all high school students now! Needs to be a requirement for graduation OH should require Personal Finance for graduation (.5 credit).\n\nThe CORE falls short; Current Economics standards are inadequate if the hope is it can be integrated here.\n\nPersonal Finance should be a required class for a high school juniors and/or seniors.\n\nPersonal Finance should be a required High School class taught in the Business Department.\n\nShould be mandatory for all students Should be required.\n\nStudents need more and it SHOULD be a required course for all students.\n\nThere are too many schools that do not provide a personal finance course and/or have cut them from the curriculum. This course should be mandatory for graduation. The students that need this information the most are the students not getting it.\n\nThis course needs to become a requirement to graduate! It has to be taught properly however with hands on involvement or the course will be dry and students will lose interest.\n\nThis course should be mandatory in the State of Ohio.\n\nThis needs to be a required course for all high school students and most adults.\n\nThis needs to be taught in more schools and should be a required subject matter.\n\nThis should be a required course in ALL school districts.\n\nThis should be a required course through the business department not the social studies department by all schools in Ohio immediately.\n\nAny textbook suggestions (grade 9-12) would be welcomed. I think it's unbelievable that the state is putting checking I wish it was required at my school.\n\nAppendix 3 account management into the social studies curriculum.\n\nI would certainly like to have any teaching materials and/ or lessons that your organization may offer. Thanks.\n\nI would love to have a written curriculum for teaching personal finance at the high school level in an FCS program.\n\nSince this information is not readily available in text books and changes rapidly, I would also like access to hands on technology so that… I would really be nice to have a list of web site on personal finance that is geared for high school students. Also, ones that have projects for students that encourage critical thinking and collaboration.\n\nIt is hard to find a good textbook that covers all of the topics you want to cover in a personal finance class. I use the text as a basis and spend endless hours getting supplemental materials to cover the topics that I feel are important.\n\nIt would be great to receive free classroom materials from financial institutions.\n\nIt would be nice if state standards were available as guidelines. Up to date statistics in a concise table or format that can be used on over heads or power points are the most helpful sources. All sources need to be something that can be picked up quick and a dedicated topic.\n\nI find it interesting that there seems to be so much emphasis recently on financial education, yet business teachers have no state standards. Is personal finance a priority or not?\n\nI have a real concern that the new stat e standards have aligned the financial literacy class with social study standards.\n\nThis will allow many schools to use their current economics class which is far from a personal finance curriculum.\n\nMy concern is that with the new state mandated \"personal finance\" in our curriculum, individual school districts will not pay any attention to what department is teaching the material.\n\nMy only concern is that due to recent changes in high school graduation requirements is that some of our course work will not be deemed as being important to our students. The areas I plan on teaching more personal finance but I do need more materials.\n\n\" \"\n\nNote: rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = \"never\" to 5 = \"very often\"; Pearson Chi-Square = 53.653, df = 6, p < .001 (two-sided)\n\nNote: Levene's test of equality of error variances tests the null hypothesis that the error variance of the dependent variable is equal across academic content areas;"
