    "abstract": "Coniferin, the glucoside of the monolignol coniferyl alcohol, accumulates to high levels in gymnosperms during spring-cambial reactivation. A cinnamyl alcohol glucoside/P-glucosidase system is thought to play a key role i n lignification by releasing the monolignol aglycones. lnvestigation of such an enzyme system in the xylem of Pinus contorta var latifolia Engelm. revealed two major P-glucosidases. One efficiently hydrolyzed the native substrate, coniferin, and the other was more active against synthetic glucosides. l h e coniferin P-glucosidase was purified to apparent homogeneity using anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size-exclusion chromatography. The apparent native molecular weight was estimated to be 60,000. A dominant 28-kD protein and a minor 24-kD protein were detected in the purified preparation following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. lmmunological evidence from polyclonal antibodies directed against the synthetic N-terminal peptide of the 24-kD protein suggested that the native protein is a dimer of 28-kD subunit size. The N-terminal sequence showed that coniferin P-glucosidase has high homology to known plant P-glucosidases. Coniferin, syringin, and a synthetic coniferin analog were preferred substrates for the coniferin 6-glucosidase. In situ localization using the chromogenic coniferin analog showed the exclusive presence of P-glucosidase activity in the differentiating xylem, similar to peroxidase activity.",
    "full_text": "Lignin is the second most abundant organic material in the biosphere and is a major component of cell walls of woody plants. It is a complex polymer of three cinnamyl alcohols, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl, a11 products of phenylpropanoid metabolism. Depending on the plant species or tissue, the relative proportion of the different monomers in lignin can vary significantly. In gymnosperms, lignin is composed predominantly of coniferyl alcohol monomer units, whereas angiosperms have significant proportions of sinapyl moieties. The 4-O-glucoside of coniferyl alcohol, coniferin, is known to accumulate in conifer xylem during cambium reactivation, consistent with a role as the dominant lignin precursor in these species (Freudenberg and Harkin, 1963;Savidge, 1989). Before being polymerized to lignin, however, coniferin must be hydrolyzed to free the phenolic hydroxyl. Although the cinnamyl alcohol glucoside/P-glucosidase system has been implicated in lignification, the evidence has been primarily correlative. P-Glucosidases capable of hydrolyzing coniferin have been detected in suspension culture systems (Hosel and Todenhagen, 1980;Hosel et al., 1982) and seedlings (Marcinowski and Grisebach, 1978), but, to our knowledge, a coniferin glucosidase has not been idektified that derives from differentiating xylem of mature trees, the most active site for lignin biosynthesis in woody plants.\n\nModification of quality and quantity of lignin in plants for increasing the strength of wood or for enhancing pulpability of trees has been a long-standing interest among tree breeders and, more recently, among molecular biologists. Alteration of lignin levels by antisense and sense suppression of gene expression has already been attempted for severa1 enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, including phenyl ammonia-lyase (Elkind et al., 1990), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (Schuch, 1993), and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (Lee and Douglas, 1994). It is clear, however, that interference with early steps in the phenylpropanoid pathway can have undesirable pleiotropic effects (Elkind et al., 1990). Coniferin hydrolysis to release coniferyl alcohol is one of the final steps in the reaction sequence of lignin biosynthesis, which makes coniferin P-glucosidase a particularly suitable target for biotechnological modulation of lignin in trees. This possibility gains support from the observation that the only lignificationrelated phenylpropanoid metabolite accumulating to a significant degree in lodgepole pine (Pinus conforta) xylem tissues is coniferin (Savidge, 1988(Savidge, , 1989)). Therefore, we have undertaken the characterization of such an enzyme in lignifying conifer tissue as an initial step toward cloning the corresponding gene. In this paper, we describe the major P-glucosidases found in differentiating lodgepole pine xylem and report the properties of a coniferin-specific enzyme that has been purified to apparent homogeneity.\n\nTen-to 15-year-old Pinus conforta var latifolia Engelm. Plant Physiol. Vol. 107, 1995 Forest (Haney, British Columbia) and from Pacific Forest Products Ltd. (Saanich, Vancouver Island) were felled at the beginning of the growing season (late May to early June). The logs were quickly debarked, the differentiating xylem layer was scraped off with razor blades, and the tissue was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70°C.\n\nThe glucosides used for detecting P-glucosidase activity in chromatographic fractions were coniferin, 4-NPG, 2-NPG, MUG, and VRA-G. VRA-G is a substrate analog of coniferin synthesized by Biosynth International Inc.\n\n(Skokie, IL). Coniferin was extracted and purified from pine xylem scrapings as described by van-Uden et al. (1991). The purity of recrystallized coniferin was compared with authentic coniferin by HPLC, TLC, and UV analysis.\n\nBuffers were as follows: buffer A, 50 mM Mes, pH 6.0; buffer B, 20 mM Mes, pH 5.5; buffer C, 20 mM Mes, pH 5.5, 0.5 M NaCl; and buffer D, 50 mM Mes, pH 5.8, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. A11 buffers contained 3 mM DTT and 10% glycerol.\n\nFrozen xylem tissue was immersed in liquid nitrogen and ground in a prechilled stainless steel blender (Waring). The resulting powder was further ground with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and extracted twice (1 g tissue/2 mL buffer) by stirring for 30 min with cold buffer A containing insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (0.1 g/g fresh weight). The crude extract was filtered through two layers of fine nylon mesh and clarified by centrifugation at 10, OOOg for 30 min. To obtain the salt-extractable P-glucosidases, the crude cell-wall residue remaining from the buffer extraction was further extracted with 2 volumes of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl for 3 h at 4\"C, followed by filtration and centrifugal clarification as above.\n\nThe standard assay containing the enzyme preparation (10-50 pL) and substrate (2 mM final concentration) in 0.2 M Mes, pH 5.5, buffer in a final volume of 150 pL was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by basification of the assay mixture with an equal volume of 0.5 M CAPS, pH 10.5, and the activity was measured by determining the absorbance of the released aglycone. For quantitative calculations, the following analysis wavelengths and E values (mMpl cmp') were used: coniferyl alcohol, 325 nm, E = 7.0; sinapyl alcohol, 315 nm, E = 11.2; 2-nitrophenol, 420 nm, E = 4.55; 4-nitrophenol, 400 nm, E = 19.3; 4-methyl umbelliferone, 360 nm, E = 18.25; 544hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylmethylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one-3-ethanoic acid, 490 nm, E = 38.6; salicyl alcohol, 295 nm, E = 3.3. P-Glucosidase activity in a11 fractions generated chromatographically during enzyme purification was monitored using both 1 mM coniferin and 4-NPG as substrates. The ability of purified coniferin P-glucosidase and partially purified MUG P-glucosidase to hydrolyze various substrates was determined at 2 mM. K , values for these substrates were calculated based both on Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes plots. Inhibitor studies with P-glucosidase inhibitors bromoconduritol mixed isomers (6-bromo-4-cyclohexene-1,2,3-triol), conduritol B epoxide (~~-1,2-anhydromyoinositol), and glucono-1,5-lactone were carried out with 0.1 to 5.0 mM inhibitor and with coniferin or MUG as substrates.\n\nThe extract was brought to 95% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the solution was stirred for 2 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 12,0009 for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in buffer B and desalted using a column of Bio-Gel P6DG resin (Bio-Rad) into the same buffer. The desalted extract was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a QMA MemSep 1010 cartridge (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Proteins were eluted in a shallow gradient of buffer C. A11 chromatographic fractions were assayed for P-glucosidase activity using the range of glucosides listed in \"Biochemicals and Buffers.\"\n\nThe buffer extract was brought to 70% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate at 4°C with gentle stirring for 1 h, and the protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,0009 for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B and desalted using a Bio-Gel P6DG column. The desalted extract was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 X 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer B, washed with the same buffer to remove unbound protein, and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05 to 0.4 M NaCl using buffer C. Chromatographic fractions having coniferin glucosidase activity were pooled, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 2 M. After the pH was adjusted to 5.8, the sample was fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a 1.5 X 20-cm tert-butyl Macroprep (Bio-Rad) column. The elution was carried out with a decreasing salt gradient of ammonium sulfate (2.0-0.0 M) and a simultaneously increasing pH gradient (5.8-6.6). The active fractions were desalted into buffer B (pH 5.7) by ultrafiltration on 5000 mo1 wt cutoff Filtron (Northborough, MA) centrifugal filters or stirred cell device and subjected to the second anion-exchange purification using a QMA MemSep 1010 (Millipore) cartridge equilibrated with buffer B (pH 5.7) and a 0.02 to 0.12 M NaCl gradient. Active chromatographic fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration as above and chromatographed on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column, equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.25 M NaCl. The most active fractions were used for enzyme characterization and electrophoretic analysis. A11 of the above chromatographic separations were performed using a Bio-Rad Econo low pressure chromatographic system or a fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia) system. Protein profiles during chromatography were monitored by A,,,. Quantifica-tion of protein was carried out using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, based on the Bradford method.\n\nFor molecular mass determination of the native enzyme, the Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column was calibrated using ferretin ( M , 440,000), catalase ( M , 232,0001, aldolase ( M , 158,000), BSA (Mr 67,0000), and chymotrypsinogen ( M , 25,000).\n\nThe pI of the enzyme was estimated by chromatofocusing of purified enzyme on a Mono-P HR 5/10 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 20 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, using a pH gradient of 5.5 to 4.0, in 1OX diluted Poly Buffer 74 (Pharmacia).\n\nDenaturing gel electrophoresis was conducted according to the standard Laemmli (1970) procedure in 12% polyacrylamide gels. The mo1 wt standards used were Rainbow prestained markers (Amersham) or Promega (Madison, WI) mid-range molecular weight markers. For protein visualization, gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or silver (Sambrook et al., 1989).\n\nElectrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed at 4°C according to the Laemmli procedure but with exclusion of SDS and P-mercaptoethanol and a reduction in separating gel buffer pH to 8.4 to enhance the stability of the enzyme. For P-glucosidase activity staining, the gels were equilibrated in 20 mM Mes, pH 5.5, for 20 min, followed by incubation in 2 mM VRA-G or 0.2 mM MUG for 1 h. The gels incubated with VRA-G were basified with 0.25 M CAPS, pH 9, to intensify the orange color of the aglycone. The gels incubated with MUG were washed in three changes of water and the aglycone was detected by its fluorescence under UV light.\n\nFor SDS-PAGE analysis of native gel protein bands that stained positively for P-glucosidase activity, the active bands were excised into 2 X SDS loading buffer, equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature (or boiled for 4 min), transferred to sample wells of SDS-PAGE gels (with stacking gel at least 3 times the height of the gel slices), and electrophoresed.\n\nThe purified enzyme was run on preparative native-PAGE gels and stained for P-glucosidase activity using VRA-G. The active band was excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. After electroblotting onto Immobilon P\"q-polyvinylidenedifluoride membrane (Millipore), the excised 28-and 24-kD protein bands were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 470A gas phase sequencer with on-line PTH-amino acid analysis (Protein Microchemistry Center, University of Victoria).\n\nData base searches were performed with BLASTP version 1.3.11MP (Altschul et al., 1990) and FASTA version 1 . 4 ~ (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) on SWISSPROT release 28 and Protein Identification Resource release 41 .O.\n\nThe sequence of amino acid residues 2 to 16 from the 24-kD protein was used to direct synthesis of a 15-amino acid-long peptide using an Applied Biosystems 430A automated peptide synthesizer at the Nucleic Acid and Protein Services Unit, Biotechnology Laboratory, University of British Columbia. The synthetic peptide was coupled to c-BSA (Imject Super Carrier, Pierce) by EDC-mediated amide formation, following the manufacturer's recommendations with some modifications. Briefly, the carrier (c-BSA) and the peptide were dissolved in conjugation buffer (pH 4.3), followed by the addition of 0.5 mg/mL EDC. After incubation at 25°C for 1.5 h, unconjugated peptide and residual EDC were removed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P6DG column. The conjugation was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis on an SDS-PAGE gel. Polyclonal antibodies to this conjugate were elicited in a female New Zealand White rabbit by injecting (subcutaneously) 300 pg of conjugate and complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosters (intramuscular) every 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained 10 d after each booster injection.\n\nAffinity remova1 of anti-BSA antibodies from the serum was carried out by incubating diluted serum (1:50 dilution with PBS) overnight at 4°C with BSA-loaded nitrocellulose membrane.\n\nAfter SDS-PAGE or native PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and total protein was detected with 0.2% (w/v) Ponceau S in 3% acetic acid. After destaining in PBS, the blots were blocked with 3% gelatin from cold-water fish skin (Sigma) in PBS. The western blots were developed using a Promega western blot kit with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, following the manufacturer's instructions. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-peptide antiserum) was used at a dilution of 1:700. An SDS-PAGE blot of the purified enzyme was probed for glycoproteins using a Boehringer Mannheim digoxigenin glycan detection kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nTo localize P-glucosidase activity, transverse \"freehand' sections from a 2-year-old P. conforta stem were transferred to cold, degassed 20 mM Mes, pH 5.5, for 10 min. After incubation in an air-tight chamber with the chromogenic substrate VRA-G (2 mM) in the same buffer for 30 min without agitation, the sections were transferred to microscope slides and basified with 0.25 M CAPS, pH 9. The instantaneous stain response was immediately photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope and Kodak Ektachrome 160 ASA tungsten film. As a control, the nonchromogenic substrate coniferin was used to stain neighboring sections.\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 107, 1995 Peroxidases were localized by equilibrating the sections in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5, for 10 min, followed by the addition of 0.05% alcoholic syringaldazine with, or without, 0.03% H 2 O 2 . The color reaction was photographed as described above. Lignin in the above stem sections was localized according to our method developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (Dharmawardhana et al., 1992) using Basic Fuchsin-induced fluorescence.\n\nOur initial experiments revealed that the pH optimum for pine xylem /3-glucosidases, tested against a variety of substrates, was in the range of pH 5 to 6. Following anionexchange chromatography, the total extractable xylem protein could be resolved into three major populations of /3-glucosidases (Fig. 1). Only peak 3 had coniferin-hydrolyzing activity, and it was also active against the coniferin analog, VRA-G. The /3-glucosidases in peaks 1 and 2 were able to hydrolyze all of the synthetic glucosides used, including VRA-G, but not coniferin.\n\nActivity-stained native-PAGE gels of proteins from the three /3-glucosidase activity peaks revealed a different pattern in each peak (Fig. 2). The MUG activity of peak 1 migrated only slightly into the separating gel and appeared diffuse (Fig. 2, lane 4). On lower percentage (7%) polyacrylamide gels, this activity produced a broad smear on the upper half of the separating gel without discrete bands (results not shown). The relative activity of peak 1 varied substantially from extraction to extraction, even in tissues of the same tree. This material might be an aggregated or complexed form of the /3-glucosidase(s) found in peak 2, given that the substrate preferences were also similar. In\n\nFigure 2. Native-PAGE and activity staining of the three major /3-glucosidase populations (peaks 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1) resolved by anion-exchange chromatography. The gels were stained for /3-glucosidase activity using MUG or VRA-G as substrates (B) and for protein with Coomassie brilliant blue (A). Lanes 1, 2, and 3 are protein profiles of peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Lanes 4 and 5 correspond to MUG activity of lanes 1 and 2. Lane 6 is the VRA-G activity of lane 3. BSAd, BSA dimer (mol wt 1 32,000); BSAm, BSA monomer (mol wt 66,000); CEA, chicken egg albumin (mol wt 45,000).\n\ncontrast, activity peaks 2 and 3 each yielded single major bands on activity-stained gels (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), with the coniferin-active peak (peak 3) showing a band of VRA-G-hydrolyzing activity that migrated slightly faster than the MUG-hydrolyzing activity observed in peak 2. Based on these activity staining responses, the /3-glucosidases in peaks 2 and 3 were designated MUG /3-glucosidase and coniferin /3-glucosidase, respectively.\n\nFurther extraction of buffer-extracted xylem cell walls with 0.5 M NaCl released less than 5% additional coniferinhydrolyzing activity, but it did release another 20 to 30% of the /3-glucosidases active against MUG, which included other minor species in addition to the major species observed in peaks 1 and 2 (data not shown).\n\nThe optimized purification protocol resulted in an enzyme purification of more than 2700-fold in four chromatographic steps (Table I; Fig. 3). The resultant preparation produced a single band on silver-stained native-PAGE gels (Fig. 4A), which coincided with /3-glucosidase activity staining on gels using the chromogenic coniferin analog, VRA-G, and with coniferin hydrolytic activity on gel slices from duplicate lanes (Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE of the single band from native gels produced two protein bands of 28 and 24 kD (essentially similar to Fig. 3, lane 5), with the 24-kD band being of much lower intensity. The omission of /3-mercaptoethanol from the SDS-PAGE loading buffer did not change the banding pattern or the observed molecular mass. A smaller molecular mass band close to the dye front was also discernible on some gels, especially on Coomassie-stained gels with high protein loading, but this probably represents a degradation artifact.\n\nThe molecular mass of the native enzyme from calibrated Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography was 60 kD. This value is consistent with the relative mobility of the coniferin /3-glucosidase and of the native molecular mass standards on native-PAGE gels. The subunit molecular mass estimated from the mobility of the purified protein on SDS-PAGE was 28 kD (and/or 24 kD), implying a dimeric structure.\n\nThe optimum pH for coniferin hydrolytic activity at 30°C was between 5.4 and 5.9, and the enzyme was most stable within that pH range. The pi, estimated by chromatofocusing of the pure enzyme, was pH 4.5. The protein of interest reacted as a glycoprotein when the SDS-PAGE blots were probed for the presence of sugars by periodate oxidation and labeling with digoxigenin via a hydrazide conjugate, followed by immunodetection.\n\nThe activity of both coniferin jS-glucosidase (purified) and MUG /3-glucosidase (partially purified) on a range of glycoside substrates is summarized in Table II. MUG 1 2 3 4 5 14-Figure 3. Documentation of sequential purification of coniferin j3-glucosidase. Pooled active fractions from each purification stage were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and visualized by silver staining (lanes 1-5): lane 1, desalted 70% (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitate; lane 2, Q-Sepharose pool; lane 3, ferf-butyl pool; lane 4, QMA MemSeplOlO pool; lane 5, most active Superose 12 fraction. Arrowheads, 28-and 24-kD bands.\n\n/3-glucosidase was able to hydrolyze a range of synthetic glucosides and shows particularly high affinity for the two synthetic substrates, 4-NPG and MUG. The hydrolysis of coniferin and syringin by this preparation was slow and yielded high K m values. The galactoside of 2-nitrophenol was also hydrolyzed to some degree by the MUG /3glucosidase.\n\nIn contrast, coniferin /3-glucosidase was very active against the native substrate, coniferin, and the related syringin, for which low K m values were obtained. The only other substrates that were hydrolyzed to a substantial degree by the coniferin j3-glucosidase were 2-NPG and the coniferin analog, VRA-G (Table II). At lower substrate concentrations (<0.5 HIM), VRA-G actually exhibited a higher activity relative to coniferin (results not shown). This could be due to nonlinearity of the VRA-G assay at higher concentrations and/or to the saturation of enzyme with VRA-G at lower concentrations. Neither enzyme was capable of hydrolyzing a disaccharide-containing glycoside, 4-nitrophenyl j3-cellobioside or a-linked MUG.\n\nOf the three j3-glucosidase inhibitors, bromoconduritol (mixed isomers), conduritol B epoxide, and glucono-1,5lactone, only glucono-l,5-lactone was effective in inhibiting coniferin /3-glucosidase. The MUG /3-glucosidase (partially pure) was effectively inhibited by both bromoconduritol (mixed isomers) and glucono-l,5-lactone.  Native-PAGE analysis of purified coniferin /3-glucosidase from P. contorta. Following native PACE, one lane was sliced into 0.5-cm segments and equilibrated for 20 min with 0.5 M Mes, pH 5.5, each segment was pulverized with 200 /j,L of 2 mM coniferin (pH 5.5) and incubated for 2 h, and after the samples were basified, the absorbance of the released aglycone (coniferyl alcohol) was measured at 325 nm. A duplicate lane was stained in situ with VRA-G (B) and subsequently silver stained to detect proteins (A).\n\nThe 28-kD protein appeared to be N-terminally blocked, since it did not give a signal during automated sequencing. The 24-kD protein, on the other hand, yielded a 15-amino acid sequence, which was found to have high homology to known plant /3-glucosidases. The optimal sequence alignment shows that the 24-kD coniferin /3-glucosidase N-terminal sequence has a 60 to 70% similarity to the N-terminal region of /3-glucosidases from Zea mays, cassava, and barley (Fig. 5).\n\nA synthetic 15-amino acid N-terminal peptide was made immunogenic by coupling it to the carrier protein, c-BSA.\n\nIn addition to eliciting an enhanced immune response compared to unmodified BSA (Muckerheide et al., 1987), use of c-BSA enabled us to couple the peptide predominantly through its C-terminal carboxyl group, since the majority of available carboxyl groups on c-BSA have been substituted with aminoethylamide groups. Coupling via carboxyl groups of the two Asp residues of the peptide was suppressed by acidifying the coupling reaction to pH 4.3.\n\nSDS-PAGE analysis of c-BSA before (Fig. 6, lane 2) and after (Fig. 6, lane 1) peptide coupling confirmed the efficiency of the reaction.\n\nFollowing the removal of anti-BSA antibodies, the induced anti-peptide-c-BSA serum reacted with a single protein band in partially purified (after one anion-exchange step) coniferin 0-glucosidase fractions, as well as with the completely purified protein (Fig. 7B) on western blots of native-PAGE gels. On SDS-PAGE blots, it reacted strongly with the 28-kD protein and more weakly with the 24-kD protein from which the antigenic peptide sequence had been derived. However, the intensity of reaction on these blots also reflects the amount of protein present in the 28and 24-kD bands (Fig. 7A). The abundance of the 24-kD band relative to the 28-kD band was low and variable between different enzyme preparations. These results suggest that the 28-and 24-kD proteins are very similar, at least in their N-terminal sequence. One possible explanation is that the 24-kD protein is a processing or degradation product of the 28-kD protein subunit (in vivo or postextraction) or is an unglycosylated form.\n\nThe majority of the j3-glucosidase activity in rapidly growing P. contorta stem tissue is clearly localized to the\n\nFinns: CBG24 ze: ZM-pSO.l sava: pCASS ley: BglBl : BglP lover: BgltT Iba: Myro B.

The background yellow color is from the unhydrolyzed glucoside. Although the product appears to be more prominent on the cell walls of the differentiating xylem, it is not possible to specify the exact cellular location of /3-glucosidase activity with this technique because of diffusion of the aglycone product. Peroxidase localization using syringaldazine as a substrate revealed a localization pattern similar to that of /3-glucosidase (Fig. 8B) in the differentiating xylem cell walls. The staining of sections with syringaldazine in the absence of H 2 O 2 substrate did not yield a significant color reaction. The Basic Fuchsininduced lignin fluorescence of stem sections (Fig. 8C) used for enzyme localization demonstrated that both /3-glucosidase activity and peroxidase activity are restricted to the most recently lignified/lignifying region of the differentiating xylem.\n\nWe have shown that lignifying lodgepole pine xylem possesses two major types of aromatic /3-glucosidases. One (MUG /3-glucosidase) is able to efficiently hydrolyze a variety of synthetic aromatic glucosides, and the second enzyme, coniferin /3-glucosidase, is far more specific for the native substrate, coniferin.\n\nThe coniferin-specific j8-glucosidase was purified to apparent homogeneity and appears to have a native molecular mass of 60,000 D. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed two bands of 28 and 24 kD, but the immunological data, together with the asymmetric quantity of protein in the two bands, suggest that the native structure is a homodimer of 28-kD subunit size. A /3-glu-cosidase has been reported from barley endosperm that also shows two immunologically similar proteins differing in apparent molecular mass by 3 to 4 kD on SDS-PAGE (Simos et al., 1994). These proteins also change in their relative abundance during different stages of germination.\n\nThe N-terminal sequences of the two barley protein bands are identical, and it was suggested that the lower molecular mass form is the result of limited in vivo proteolysis of the higher molecular mass form. If this scenario is also applicable to the coniferin /3-glucosidase (which shows 60% similarity in N-terminal amino acid sequence to the barley protein), then the processed 24-kD protein, of relatively low abundance, may be co-migrating with the dominant 28-kD protein as a homo-or heterodimer in native-PAGE gels, with the apparent 4-kD subunit difference of this minor species showing up only upon separation of subunits during SDS-PAGE.\n\nAlthough the origin of the 28-and 24-kD proteins cannot be specified definitively, their N-terminal amino acid sequences are immunologically highly cross-reactive. The high homology of this sequence to other cloned plant /3-glucosidases, together with the demonstration of coniferin hydrolytic specificity and VRA-G staining of a single protein band in native gels, unequivocally confirms the identity of these subunits as coniferin /3-glucosidase. Unlike this coniferin /3-glucosidase from P. contorta, the coniferin-hydrolyzing enzyme detected in Norway spruce seedlings (Marcinowski and Grisbach, 1978) is an apparently monomeric, 59-kD protein. Most known glucosidases are monomeric, but several plant j3-glucosidases are reported to be oligomeric, including a /3-glucosidase from cassava (Yeoh and Woo, 1992), dhurrinase from sorghum (Hosel et al., 1987), prunasin hydrolase from black cherry B •BSAd\n\n•CEA 14-Figure 7.

As with most other glycosidases, the coniferin 0-glucosidase from pine is also a glycoprotein. The P. contorta coniferin /3-glucosidase displays a clear substrate preference for coniferin. Syringin, the glucoside of sinapyl alcohol, differs from coniferin only by a single O-methyl group and is also hydrolyzed efficiently. Other coniferin-hydrolyzing glucosidases from Glycine max suspension cultures (Hosel and Todenhagen, 1980) and spruce seedlings were also capable of using both hydroxycinnamyl alcohol glucosides as substrates. Although lodgepole pine tissue appears to accumulate only coniferin during the period of rapid lignification (D.P. Dharmawardhana and B.E. Ellis, unpublished observation), Freudenberg and Harkin (1963) reported that spruce cambial sap did contain a small amount of syringin in addition to large amounts of coniferin. Coniferin /3-glucosidase might therefore be responsible for the hydrolysis of both of these glucosides to release monolignols for lignin biosynthesis in conifers, but the predominance of guaiacyl units in conifer lignin would reflect the composition of the substrate supply stream rather than the specificity of the 0-glucosidase. Whereas the spruce seedling /3-glucosidase described by Marcinowski and Grisebach (1978) hydrolyzed coniferin/syringin, its physico-chemical properties differ markedly from the coniferin /3-glucosidase reported here, most notably in the basic charge of the spruce seedling enzyme (pi 10), as opposed to the acidic nature of the P. contorta enzyme (pi 4.5).\n\nThe in situ /3-glucosidase activity staining in sections of rapidly growing P. contorta stem, using VRA-G, showed reaction products restricted to the zone of rapid xylem differentiation and lignification, centripetal to the vascular cambium of the stem. The localization of peroxidase, an enzyme implicated in the final step of lignin polymerization, using syringaldazine, a substance capable of detecting peroxidases in the differentiating xylem (Harkin and Obst, 1973), closely matches the pattern observed for /3-glucosidases. Although VRA-G is not a specific substrate for coniferin /3-glucosidase, the /3-glucosidase activity was almost exclusively localized in the lignifying area of the secondary xylem, where the coniferin concentration is reported to be the highest (Savidge, 1989). The availability of antibodies specifically recognizing the coniferin /3-glucosidase enzyme (shows no apparent cross-reactivity with MUG /3-glucosidase) should now enable us to establish the exact subcellular location of this enzyme. Freudenberg and Harkin (1963) proposed that during lignin formation the monolignol precursors are transported to the cell wall as glucosides and that specific p-glucosidases within t h e cell wall would regenerate t h e monolignol aglycones for i n situ polymerization. The high activity and affinity of t h e coniferin P-glucosidase enzyme for coniferin, together with t h e localization of P-glucosidase activity exclusively i n the lignifying region of P. contortu stem, suggest that coniferin P-glucosidase may be performing a crucial role in Pinus stem lignification. The information and tools generated by the present work should enable us to isolate the corresponding cDNA clone for the P. contortu coniferin P-glucosidase and conduct more detailed studies of the organization and regulation of the ultimate steps in the lignin biosynthetic pathway.\n\na Measurement after buffer exchange.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.
