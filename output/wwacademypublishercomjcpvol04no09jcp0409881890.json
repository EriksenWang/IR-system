    "full_text": "Computational modeling can be critical for emergency planning. For instance, the release of a hazardous airborne material into a densely populated area could affect large numbers of people in a short period of time. Because hazardous materials are often stored near highly populated regions, a thorough assessment of the potential hazard is a critical task for community preparedness. In order to properly protect a population, safety measures such as rapid response plans and evacuation procedures must be developed before an event occurs. In order to develop such plans, a worst-case assessment must be done. This study reports how computational modeling can play an integral role in such an assessment.\n\nHere we study the atmospheric transport and dispersion (AT&D) of a chlorine release on a hypothetical college campus. We use state-of-the-science modeling capabilities to assess an extreme-release scenario. Two different approaches are used for near source predictions. In addition, one of those models also allows forecasts of regional transport and dispersion. The first approach uses a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, AcuSolve TM , to resolve explicitly much of the detail of the near source micrometeorology, providing a detailed realization of the dispersion event. The second approach uses the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) system that includes both an Urban Dispersion Model (UDM), suitable for near source AT&D, and the Second-Order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF) model for regional scale AT&D. HPAC is a probabilistic model that yields a prediction for the ensemble mean plume, which is useful because the meteorology and source term information is unlikely to be known accurately.\n\nModels like HPAC are practical for making rapid response decisions because run times are on the order of seconds for near-source predictions to several hours for regional dispersion predictions that are forced by finescale mesoscale Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) output on a desktop computer. The corresponding run time for a practical application of a CFD model for nearsource dispersion only may be on the order of hours to days on a Beowulf cluster. While CFD remains less attractive as a rapid response tool due to run times, such simulations can be quite useful for emergency planning and are the best way to assess details of flows around buildings. The results of Gaussian models, such as SCIPUFF, should be carefully evaluated when applied to urban settings. Brown details significant challenges for these tools including the need for them to accurately model enhanced mixing due to building influence and street channeling [1]. Their strength lies in their speed and their ability to rapidly model medium range (on the order of hundreds to thousands of kilometers) transport and dispersion.\n\nSeveral railcar accidents in recent years have brought much attention to the study of chlorine dispersion. Buckley et al. reviewed the real-time response to such an accident as well as conducted a post-analysis of the incident [2]. In January 2005, a freight train collision in Graniteville, SC released nearly 70 tons of pressurized liquid chlorine into the atmosphere. The chlorine vaporized upon contact with the air and a dense cloud formed quickly and spread to the surroundings. The event resulted in nine deaths and more than 500 injuries. In this case, the emergency managers used a Puff/Plume and Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model to aid in their decision making and used HPAC in their post-analysis. Buckley et al [2]. stressed the importance of rapid response models that are easy to interpret and provide information quickly enough to pass along to emergency managers.\n\nHanna et al. conducted a comprehensive analysis of six commonly used dense-gas dispersion models to study how each model assessed the effects of three recent railcar accidents [3]. They studied the release of 21,792 kg of chlorine in Festus, MO in 2002, the release of 54,480 kg of chlorine in Macdona, TX in 2004, as well as the Graniteville release. While Hanna et al. found generally good agreement for concentration fields among the six models, they point out that an accurate source term is critical to the computation of reliable results. They also recognize the need to incorporate chemical reactions, photolysis, and deposition into existing models.\n\nThe chemistry of chlorine itself can greatly complicate the atmospheric transport and dispersion of a release. Chlorine is a greenish-yellow highly reactive gas with a strong, offensive odor [4]. Chlorine vapor is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air so a cloud will form very near the release and transport is likely to stay near the ground, which causes accurate prediction to become complicated by the presence of buildings and other structures. Pressurized liquid chlorine presents an additional challenge because a small hole in a chlorine tank creates a jet that expels much of the chlorine in an extremely short period of time [5]. Following this initial release, there is a slow release of the remaining liquid and vapor phase chlorine often referred to as off gassing [2]. The dual phase nature of chlorine spills makes determining the actual amount of chlorine released extremely difficult.\n\nThe health effects associated with chlorine are extremely dependent upon the duration of exposure and the fitness of the individual. We make no attempt to analyze or assess the various guidelines currently in place. The following refers to the acute effects guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency [6]. Irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat has been noted at exposure levels less than 1 ppm. The odor threshold for chlorine is 0.3 ppm and the smell of a chlorinated swimming pool is typically associated with a concentration value of 1 ppm. At higher levels of chlorine exposure, 30 ppm, chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and vomiting has been reported. Toxic pneumonitis and pulmonary edema have been reported from 46 -60 ppm.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to provide a high quality modeling study for a worst-case scenario, to assess the relative accuracy of the rapid response tools, and to provide an analysis of the maximum possible impact of the release on the nearby population. To this end we use both a rapid response AT&D approach (HPAC) and a CFD modeling approach to illustrate different modeling aspects in an effort to aid development of emergency response preparedness for a worst-case scenario event. We seek to provide the results of the physical modeling of the atmospheric transport and dispersion as a case study for situational awareness and preparedness planning. We also assess the similarities and differences in the two different modeling approaches, including an analysis of the differences between the ensemble average approach of HPAC and the specific realization produced by the CFD model. Finally, we discuss the interpretation of both CFD and HPAC model data and how they can contribute to well informed decisions.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: we first lay out the modeling approach, discussing the common features in section II, the CFD methodology in section III, and the HPAC approach in section IV. Results appear in section V. Section VI summarizes and discusses implications and areas of future work.\n\nTypical college campuses have natatoriums and a dense population of students, which makes this an interesting case to study. We choose a worst-case scenario and we model the transport and dispersion of an artificially large amount of chlorine contained in a natatorium on the day of a major sporting event with light winds transporting the material towards a stadium. We use the enhanced fidelity of CFD to local geometry and meteorology to model in detail the near-source dispersing plume, including the detail of the source flux from a storage room. That data then provides a means to assess how well HPAC is able to model short-term, near-source behavior. We seek to produce a scenario that can subsequently be used as a starting point for planning appropriate response measures.\n\nNatatoriums typically store several canisters of chlorine. To model an extreme-case event, we assume that the entire mass of chlorine from 24 canisters is released at one time. This release results in an artificially large release of 1650 kg of chlorine. We assume that all of the chlorine is expelled directly into the atmosphere over a 60 minute period, resulting in an emission rate of 0.46 kg/s. We also assume that there is no action taken to mitigate the leak.\n\nFor the CFD portion, the release of the chlorine from the natatorium is modeled as being vented via a fan connecting the chlorine room with the lee side of the structure. The cloud is then transported through a cluster of campus buildings toward a major football stadium. The HPAC release specifies the same release rate; however, that does not guarantee the same dispersion path between the natatorium and the stadium. In both instances, we model the release of chlorine as emerging from an idealized leak from a single canister. We assume no liquid pooling near the source as a result of a jet. Therefore, we model a vapor phase release only. Chlorine removal via dry deposition and chemical reactions are not considered, therefore concentration values are likely to be conservative or even inflated.\n\nThe initial simulations assume a fixed wind direction and wind speed throughout the entire domain. In this scenario, the wind direction that is most likely to impact the stadium and, therefore, the greatest population is deliberately chosen, thus creating a worst-case scenario. A light wind speed of 4 m s -1 is used because high winds would rapidly move material out of the area of interest. We assume scattered clouds, no precipitation, and normal soil moisture. Later, we examine the release on a regional scale using temporally and spatially varying wind fields from actual predicted weather data.\n\nThe building aware near-source flow conditions and resulting concentration patterns are most accurately computed using CFD. CFD allows for the simulation of fine structure detail of fluid flow and the resulting transport and dispersion of a contaminant. While computationally prohibitive for rapid response planning, CFD is an excellent tool for examining localized flow interacting with building structures. A commercial finite element flow solver, AcuSolve TM , is used in this study [7]. AcuSolve TM is based on a Galerkin/least squares finite element formulation and is second-order accurate in space and time [8]. AcuSolve TM has shown to be robust and accurate for incompressible Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) simulations such those found in this study. Standard Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a Spalart-Allmaras one-equation turbulence model provide the RANS closure used in the solution method. The DES used here is based on the model by Spalart et al. [9]. The principle idea is that the characteristic turbulence length scale is modified by using the minimum of the RANS definition and a scaled length based on grid dimension. Since the destruction term in the Spalart model is proportional to the inverse of the characteristic length scale, smaller values lead to increased destruction resulting in smaller eddy diffusivities. Therefore, as the mesh becomes more refined, more turbulence is resolved and less is subgrid. The limit is direct numerical simulation (DNS).\n\nWe solve the coupled mass, momentum, and scalar transport equations on an unstructured mesh. The simulation was run on eight nodes of a Beowulf cluster at 240,000 grid points per node for 200 hours to simulate six minutes of the release.\n\nThe computational domain consists of both a large outer area representing a portion of a typical college campus, comprised of a mix of building types and heights (Fig. 1). This outer area has coupled to it a single interior room (Fig. 2a), located at the rear of the natatorium building, from which the chlorine is released. The outer area is approximately 0.6 km by 2 km in the horizontal and 300 m in height (Fig. 2b). We use an unstructured mesh composed of wedge, pyramid, and tetrahedral elements. Building geometry is resolved using quadrilateral surface elements with 1 m spacing. The ground mesh is formed from nearly isotropic triangular elements ranging in size from 1 m resolution near buildings to 200 m at the far field. The nominal resolution in the spaces between buildings is about 20 m. Mesh spacing normal to all solid surfaces is 1 m. This resolution does not allow the turbulent boundary layer to be modeled explicitly. Instead, approximate boundary conditions (wall functions) are used. The implementation in AcuSolve TM steers the running average of the near surface flow toward flat-plate boundary layer statistics with an accommodation of pressure gradient effects. Details of the computational grid, comprising about 1.9 million grid points, are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This grid resolution is expected to be adequate to resolve the vortices shed from the buildings. The basement interior room (Fig. 2a) represents the site of the chlorine release. It contains an idealized single release location representing an agglomeration of chlorine tanks, a duct to guide the chlorine to the outside and a modeled exhaust fan. In order to satisfy continuity, a door open to the inside of the building allows air to enter the room replacing the exhausted volume. The pressure drop in the room caused by the exhaust fan precludes flow from the room into the building interior. The exhaust fan is modeled as a 0.3 m by 0.3 m opening with body forces acting as the fan; it expels the chlorine from the storage room at a flow rate of 60 m s -1 .  The computational model uses DES, a hybrid approach that blends RANS modeling near walls and in the far field with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) within building wakes. The transition between the RANS and LES regions is controlled by local grid resolution. The grid is constructed to maintain LES in the region containing the chlorine plume. This method provides fine-scale time varying features of the flow field while retaining much of the computational economy of RANS. The initial guess for the DES solution was a converged RANS solution for the geometry with the same boundary conditions. This initialization sets up the dominant shear layers. Once the vortices, channeling, and separation  behind buildings are fully developed in the flow, the chlorine is released and the simulation is allowed to transition to DES.\n\nThe second model used is the HPAC transport and dispersion package developed by the Department of Defense to provide rapid response modeling of the transport and dispersion of a harmful contaminant [10].\n\nPart of the appeal of HPAC for this application is its Urban Dispersion Model (UDM) which accounts for building interactions and wakes. The UDM option of HPAC allows for a database of building locations and geometries to be defined and included in the simulation. The preprocessor, Urban Wind Model (UWM) alters the wind field to assure continuity. An advantage of UDM is that it provides rapid calculation of an urban flow in the spirit of CFD models. Unlike CFD, UDM does not account for channeling effects [11]. UDM has three different puff splitting parameterizations depending on whether the puff interacts with one building, a group of buildings, or an entire urban setting. In an urban environment puffs become larger than the structures in their path resulting in greater lateral dispersion than a model without UDM.\n\nAt a distance farther from the source, HPAC transitions to the SCIPUFF AT&D model for regional transport. SCIPUFF is a sophisticated puff-based transport and dispersion model used in HPAC that accounts for turbulence, terrain, and weather effects in its calculations [12]. SCIPUFF calculates the ensemble mean concentration field downwind of a contaminant release by computing the sum of multiple threedimensional Gaussian puffs. The model is Lagrangian in nature because it tracks individual puffs and allows each to grow, merge and split according to the conditions prescribed by the model. The unresolved turbulence in SCIPUFF is represented by a combination of large scale, shear driven and buoyancy driven turbulence.\n\nHPAC allows for the setup of various source scenarios and can include high-resolution meteorology to calculate the amount of material released into the environment. HPAC runs with UDM take as a little as five minutes to complete on a single processor for this setup.\n\nBecause UDM works with the building aware UWM model to shunt the flow around the buildings, it is necessary to provide a database of building configurations. Such a database was provided for a college campus and immediate surroundings. The near source domain illustrated in Fig. 5 is approximately 0.6 km by 2 km in size and includes traditional college buildings ranging from three to ten stories in height. The dormitory buildings, academic buildings, stadium, event center, and natatorium coupled with open areas create inhomogeneous terrain.\n\nWe also use HPAC to explore the regional transport of the chlorine over a much larger domain. That larger domain is defined in conjunction with the weather data, which includes detailed terrain data.\n\nFor the regional transport analysis, meteorological data from a 24 hour long, 4 km grid resolution run of the NCAR/Penn State MM5 mesoscale model are used. MM5 uses state-of-the-art numerical methods, physics parameterizations, and data assimilation methods to predict mesoscale atmospheric circulation [13]. The scenario chosen emphasized light winds from the southwest (to transport the contaminant toward the stadium) on a warm sunny day that would include a high level of atmospheric turbulence. The data are converted into MEDOC (Multiscale Environmental Dispersion Over Complex terrain file) format that is compatible with SCIPUFF. MEDOC data provide time-dependent wind, temperature, pressure, humidity ratio, terrain elevation, boundary layer height, and surface heat flux at a number of x, y, and z grid points on the 4 km grid [12]. Incorporating MEDOC data into the calculation increases the computation time significantly, from several minutes when using a single wind speed and direction to several hours for the high resolution MEDOC data on a desktop PC.\n\nThe CFD simulation produced a coupled flow between the chlorine room and the external flow field forced by an exhaust fan. The external flow field produced by the DES run appears in Fig. 7. Note the pervasive horseshoe vortices upwind and around the sides of each building. Such features assure us that the CFD model is producing appropriate vortical structures that are expected to influence the transport and dispersion of the chlorine. The CFD-produced chlorine plume is indicated in Fig. 8. It exhibits fine structure in the wakes behind buildings and pockets of higher concentration due to the time dependent vortical structures. Hosker has shown experimentally that these vortices influence the contaminant concentrations by acting as means of trapping and redistributing the contaminant [14]. There is ample evidence in our simulations of the influence of the building geometry on both the flow and the dispersion of the chlorine.\n\nThe comparable chlorine plume produced by HPAC is illustrated two (Fig. 9a) and six (Fig. 9b) minutes following the release. The irregular shape of the 59.0 and 29.5 mg m -3 contours suggests distortion of the plume due to building interactions as computed by UDM. After six minutes a very low concentration, 1.45 mg m -3 (0.5 ppm), begins to reach the stadium.   It is instructive to compare the HPAC results with the CFD simulation. The plumes generated by HPAC (Fig. 9) represent an ensemble average of many realizations and as such we expect them to appear more Gaussian in appearance than the single realization of the CFD simulation. This level of comparison between CFD and the HPAC results is deemed reasonable. Pullen et al. state that they have seen good correlation of what they call 'coarse-grain' statistics, such as concentration level, between Gaussian models and CFD [15]. However, they also state that 'fine-grain' statistics, such as spatial correlations, do not match as well due to the limited way in which the Gaussian models reflect building influence.\n\nThe CFD simulation (Fig. 8) extends the 60 mg m -3 contour from the natatorium and channels the flow between several of the buildings downwind for approximately 400 m. The HPAC results, however, confine the 60 mg m -3 contour to within approximately 100 m of the natatorium (Fig. 9b) while exhibiting a broader low concentration plume that extends to the stadium. While HPAC does not capture the channeling effects found in the CFD simulation, the two still exhibit favorable agreement in width and lateral extent of the overall plume as well as peak concentration levels. The disagreement in the extent of the maximum concentration values and in the plume broadness directly relates to the distinction between a prediction of a specific realization by the CFD model versus an ensemble averaged prediction modeled by HPAC. The realization can capture the local high concentration shunted between buildings. Thus, the high concentration of chlorine remains intact as it is transported between buildings by the local vortices. In contrast, the high concentration values of many members of an ensemble with slightly differing characteristics are averaged out in the HPAC application. As the plume broadens to reflect the large number of possibilities, the area of the larger concentrations must shrink in order to conserve mass of contaminant released.\n\nOne advantage of applying HPAC is that it additionally includes a probabilistic model. Such a probability assessment allows HPAC users to assess the probability of exceeding a specific concentration level and fulfills the role of considering potential worst-case realizations. The probability plots in Fig. 10 suggest the likelihood that a given region will experience a concentration above 1 ppm (3.9x10 -6 kg m -3 ) for six (Fig. 10a) and 61 (Fig. 10b) minutes following the release. Fig. 10 suggests that the plume is nearly steady after six minutes since it changes very little when compared to the plume after 61 minutes. Also, 61 minutes after the initial release the probability of concentration levels exceeding 1 ppm at the stadium is less than 30%. Recall that 1 ppm is the level commensurate with the smell of a typical swimming pool. Probability plots of 10 ppm concentrations (not shown) confine the region of exceedance to within ~400 m of the natatorium. Note that the stadium is approximately 800 m from the natatorium so it is unlikely that the large population in the stadium would experience health effects. Probability plots of 30 ppm and greater (not shown) confine the region of exceedance to the immediate vicinity of the leeside of the natatorium. We would expect that only professionally trained personnel in Hazmat suits would be this close to the release.\n\nThe regional transport is displayed in Fig. 11, which illustrates the resulting concentration two and six hours following the release. This HPAC run used the MM5 modeled MEDOC data. Note that when the 4 km resolution numerical weather prediction MEDOC data are used, one can no longer include the building geometry, necessitating a separate HPAC run. The concentration values are given in kg m -3 and approximately correspond to a range from 3.5x10 -4 ppm to 3.5x10 -8 ppm. The long range transport of chlorine becomes more diffuse over time resulting in levels so low that human scent detection would be unlikely.  Caution must be used when assessing health effects due to chlorine exposure because severe, acute events can be more harmful than an equivalent amount over a longer period of time [4]. In the event of an artificially large chlorine release the major portion of the population present at the stadium will experience less than 3 mg m -3 (1 ppm) exposure and is unlikely to experience major health effects. In this study the peak concentration values were ~59 mg m -3 (20 ppm), which according to the EPA may cause irritation, chest pain, and cough in some individuals. Although those individuals extremely near the release could suffer harm depending on their health and the amount of chlorine they inhaled, such individuals would be likely to rapidly self-evacuate.\n\nThis work has modeled a worst-case scenario study of an artificially large release of chlorine at a college natatorium. Two separate approaches allow both a validation of the rapid response model and an analysis of the differences that are expected. The rapid response model, HPAC, was used both in the near source mode that invokes the UDM building-aware model and in a regional mode that incorporates gridded mesoscale meteorological model data. The CFD simulation produced using the commercial code, AcuSolve TM , exhibits the fine structure expected of a single realization model. The near source HPAC plume, on the other hand, exhibits a more diffuse plume indicative of an ensemble averaged model. The two models exhibit favorable agreement with similar plume footprints and consistent concentration levels in space and time. Thus, we conclude that HPAC provides excellent guidance for emergency managers in real-time while the CFD simulation illustrates a high fidelity level of detail. As expected, the maximum concentrations for the CFD simulation are higher because they have not been averaged over a large ensemble of realizations. For producing a case study, the two approaches complement each other. The CFD model provides a short term picture of what could happen in a worst-case realization. In contrast, HPAC produces a reasonably good estimate of the near source concentrations in a matter of seconds on a desk top PC. The regional scale application of SCIPUFF, however, requires several hours using high resolution NWP mesoscale model data.\n\na.)\n\nIn the future we expect to address the discrepancy between the ensemble average approach of the HPAC modeling suite with the individual realizations that are inherent to the CFD by creating an ensemble of CFD flow realizations with differing meteorological conditions. This approach is necessary to include the \"outer variability\" inherent in the changes in wind direction [16]. This work may also be extended further to incorporate the infiltration and exfiltration of buildings. In collaboration with other groups, we hope to integrate this work into crowd behavior models. Additionally, the effect of ground and building heating on concentration level should be considered.\n\n© 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 4, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2009 © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER\n\nJOURNAL OF COMPUTERS, VOL. 4, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2009 © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER"
