    "full_text": "Long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are a class of repetitive, mobile DNA that has been found in the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms examined in molecular detail (Berg and Howe 1989;McDonald 1993). These elements share both structural and functional features with true infectious retroviruses, including transposition via an RNA intermediate (Boeke et al. 1985; see Finnegan and Faucett 1986 for review). Extensive interest in the effect of LTR retrotransposons on the evolution of their hosts has arisen because of the abundance and complexity of LTR retrotransposon insertion mutations (e.g., see Finnegan 1989;McDonald 1989McDonald , 1990McDonald , 1993)). Understanding the dynamics and diversity of these elements in natural host populations is prerequisite to an understanding of their potential evolutionary significance.\n\nDescriptions of the distribution of LTR retrotransposons have allowed preliminary inferences to be made into the evolutionary origins and relationships that exist among some of these elements (e.g., see Anderson et al. 1979;Benveniste 1985;Xiong and Eickbush 1990;Flavell 1992;McDonald 1993). However, to date, detailed structural studies of this class of elements within and between populations and species have been rare. This is unfortunate because such studies may produce useful information on how LTR retrotransposons behave over short spans of evolutionary time as well as providing insight into the mechanisms that may influence their evolution (e.g., see Voytas et al. 1990;Voytas 1992).\n\nThe Drosophila copia element is especially well suited to evolutionary studies, because the fruit fly has long been a model system for both population and molecular genetics and because copia is one of the most extensively studied of the Drosophila LTR retrotransposons. Copia is present in approximately 20-60 copies in the D. melanogaster genome and in somewhat lower frequency in the genomes of the melanogaster sibling species, D. simulans and D. mauritiana (Dowsett and Young 1982;Csink and McDonald 1990). A copia element isolated from a genomic library of a laboratory strain has been fully sequenced and shown to be 5,146 bp in length with flanking 276-bp LTRs. A transcript beginning in the 5' LTR and terminating in the 3' LTR contains one large continuous open-reading frame with protein-level sequence homology to retroviral gag and pol genes (Mount and Rubin 1985 ) .\n\nIn a previous study we found that copia transcript levels in adults vary widely among natural populations of D. melanogaster (Csink and McDonald 1990). Most remarkable was the finding that strains established from remote central African populations carried very low levels of copia transcripts. It was also found that copia transcripts were lacking in the adult stage of the D. melanogaster sibling species, D. simulans and D. mauritiana. These low levels or lacks of copia transcripts could not be attributed to variation in copia copy number or confinement of elements to heterochromatin. Analysis of transcript levels in crosses between lines from high-and low-transcribing D. melanogaster populations suggested that much of the intraspecific variation existing in transcript levels was due to the action of trans-acting regulatory controls. However, crosses between a high-transcribing line from Iquitos, Peru, and a low-transcribing line from Loua, Congo, consistently yielded Fl s with intermediate levels of copia transcripts. It was noted that this result is consistent with the hypothesis that differences in copia transcript levels existing between Iquitos and Loua flies are due to cis-regulatory variation.\n\nIn this article, we report that extensive intra-and intergenomic sequence variation exists among the LTRs and adjacent leader sequences of copia elements isolated from various populations of D. melanogaster. LTRs and adjacent leader sequences of copia elements isolated from D. simulans and D. mauritiana are structurally similar to one another and carry. substantial deletion variation mapping to regions previously shown to be important for copia expression in Drosophila cell lines (Sneddon and Flavell 1985).\n\nThe sequences of all copia elements isolated from D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana were subjected to several methods of phylogenetic analysis. The results indicate that although D. melanogaster elements are distinct from those of D. simulans and D. mauritiana, the elements isolated from these latter two species could not be clearly distinguished from one another.\n\nAll fly strains used in this study were derived from a single, randomly selected female from a mass culture. Oregon R was used as an example of a typical laboratory stock. The two Drosophila melanogaster lines are from Iquitos, Peru, and Loua, Congo. The D. simulans and D. mauritiana lines are from Brazzaville, Congo, and Mauritius, respectively. All the strains examined in this article have been previously described (Csink and McDonald 1990).\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from approximately 1,000 adult flies by a previously described method (Bingham et al. 198 1) . Genomic DNA was digested first with the restriction enzyme PvuII according to the supplier's instructions (Promega), phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended, and digested with the second enzyme (HindIII, CZaI, XbaI, or PstI). DNA samples were fractionated through 0.8% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters according to the method of Southern ( 1975). Filters were prehybridized in 5X SSC, 5X Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 200 mg/ ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50 mM Na2P04, and 10% dextran sulfate for 12 h at 42째C. After prehybridization, the 32P-labeled (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1984) probe, consisting of the copia PvuII-Hind111 frag-ment (fig. 1 A) subcloned into pGEM-1 (Promega), was added. Hybridization was allowed to proceed for 16-20 h at 42째C. The filters were then washed in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42째C.\n\nFour independent genomic DNA libraries were constructed. Approximately 2 ltg of genomic DNA was partially digested with Mb01 (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions, which yielded a predominance of fragments greater than 10 kb. This DNA was then treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Promega) and ligated to 1 pg of isolated lambda phage arms of the lambda replacement vector lambda-DASH (Stratagene Cloning Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe libraries were screened using two probes internal to the copia element but adjacent to the two LTRs; the Pvu II-Hind111 and the CZaI-HpaI fragment (fig. 1 A). These fragments were isolated from a cloned copia element Dm5002 (Levis et al. 1980) using agarose gel electrophoresis and labeled using the random priming method (Feinberg and Vogelstein 1984). Replicate nitrocellulose filters containing the plaque lifts (Sambrook et al. 1989) were hybridized under the high stringency conditions described above. Only plaques that were positive using both probes were isolated for further study. This approach increased our chance of analyzing only clones containing a full-length copia element and assured us that we would not isolate free LTRs. Plugs of isolated plaques were placed in 200 l.~l of SM ( 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgS04) and incubated at 37째C for 30 min.\n\nAll the restriction sites shown in figure IA were mapped in five of the initial isolates in order to get a rough estimate of variation. Six additional clones were partially restriction mapped when their sequenced DNA (fig. 2C) was found to be identical to a second clone from the same library. Differences or similarities in the flanking restriction sites revealed whether these elements were from the same insertion site. Lambda DNA was isolated (Sambrook et al. 1989) and cut with restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and the length of the fragments was determined by gel electrophoresis. In order to facilitate the mapping of restriction sites, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed as previously described with the PvuII-Hind111 copia fragment, a copia LTR-specific fragment, and full-length copia in Dm5002. Remaining ambiguities were resolved using double digests.\n\nMost of the 5' LTR and untranslated leader sequences were amplified from the copia lambda clones using the primers shown in figure 3B (also see fig. 1 A) with Tag DNA polymerase (Promega) under conditions recommended by Innis and Gelfand ( 1990). Template DNA was either 10 ng of the purified lambda DNA or 5 pl of the SM containing the phage eluted from the isolated plaque (approximately 1 O6 pfu) as described under Libraries and Screening.\n\nAfter amplification, the DNA fragment was phenol: chloroform extracted and precipitated in 50% isopropanol and 2M ammonium acetate, and the pellet was washed twice in 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE. Approximately 50 ng of this fragment was then used in an asymmetric amplification to produce singlestranded DNA. The protocol was as described by McCabe ( 1990) except that no additional limiting primer was added. Additional primer was unnecessary because a small amount of primer remained after the isopropanol precipitation from the symmetric amplification. The resulting single-stranded DNA was again phenol:chloroform extracted and isopropanol precipitated.\n\nThe PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced using the chain-termination method of DNA sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977) and employing the Sequenase version of T7 DNA polymerase (United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the following modifications. Since it was often impossible to read close to the primer when using the recommended 35S labeling reaction, the primer was end labeled using polynucleotide kinase (Sambrook et al. 1989) and the labeling step in the Sequenase protocol omitted. Approximately 20%-50% of the product from the asymmetric reactions was used in each sequencing reaction. If the above protocol using the asymmetrically amplified DNA yielded unsatisfactory results, the double-stranded PCR fragment was sequenced using an annealing procedure modified for small fragments (Kusukawa et al. 1990). All clones were sequenced in both directions by using both primers.\n\nIn order to include all other previously sequenced variants of the copia element in our analysis, we searched GenBank (release 65.0) using a previously published copia sequence ( Mount and Rubin 1985 ) isolated from the white-apricot allele of Drosophila melanogaster (hereafter designated as WA). This search yielded three additional copia sequences: Dm2056 (Flavell et al.\n\nSequence Variation within the 5' LTR and RFLP Analysis Untranslated Leader Region\n\nEach clone sequenced was assigned a name as designated in figure 3B. A subset of these clones was restriction mapped to estimate the amount of variation present in regions of the element not sequenced. Copia elements from the Iquitos, Peru ( MIPl, MIP2, MIP3), and the Loua, Congo, (MLC 1, MLC2) Drosophilu melanogaster populations were found to share the restriction map shown in figure 1 A. Interestingly, the clone MIPl was found to contain two tandemly duplicated copia elements separated by a single LTR (fig. 1C). The lambda clone containing both of these elements was used to generate the PCR fragments for sequencing.\n\nIf we assume both 5' LTRs were amplified by our primers, any disagreement between the two sequences would have given rise to a mixed pool of PCR products, and subsequent sequencing would have revealed ambiguities. No such sequence ambiguities were seen when the PCR products were sequenced. Therefore, we conclude that the regions sequenced in both these tandem elements are identical. Ty elements having this same duplicate structure have previously been identified in yeast and are believed to be the product of a homologous recombination between two full-length TJJ elements within the (LTR) region (Roeder and Fink 1983).\n\nSouthern blots of total genomic DNA digested with a restriction enzyme that cuts internally to a repetitive element and is probed with a fragment internal to the cut will appear as a single band on autoradiographs provided that all the members of the repetitive element family contain the same two flanking restriction sites that define the fragment, have no additional restriction sites within the fragment, and contain no insertion or deletion variation within the fragment. Earlier studies employing this method to examine variation in copia elements in the lab strain Oregon R showed no extra bands when probed with one internal copia restriction fragment (Potter et al. 1979). We performed a survey using a total of five restriction enzymes and found a small amount of variation among elements in all of the D. melunogaster lines examined (fig. 2). The Loua, Congo, line shows a total 18 bands (including all digests) in addition to those predicted from the full-length copia element previously sequenced by Mount and Rubin ( 1985 ), which indicates the presence of additional variation among the naturally occurring elements. Likewise, Figure 3B presents sequence data for the 27 naturally occurring copia elements analyzed in this study, as well as 4 previously published LTR sequences of copia elements isolated from laboratory strains (Flavell et al. 198 1;Rubin et al. 198 1;Emori et al. 1985;Mount and Rubin 1985 ). Of the 27 elements sequenced in this study, Sequence of LTR and leader sequence of copia element in the white-uppricot locus (Mount and Rubin 1985). Putative transcriptional initiation, poly-A addition, and enhancer sequences identified in earlier studies (Emori et al. 1985;Mount and Rubin 1985;Strand and McDonald 1985;Sneddon and Flavell 1989) are indicated. B, Summary of sequence data from this study. Each group of sequences is preceded with its consensus (G, A, T, C, invariant sites; ----, gaps inserted to maintain alignment; --------, variable gaps within a consensus; . . . . , agreement with group consensus; n, a site where a consensus could not be determined). The overscored region in the overall consensus indicates the region deleted in Drosophila  -------------------------------------  -------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------  -------------------------------------  -----------------------------------  ------------------------------ of a duplication of bases 242-270 and an additional seven bases. Two of the elements from Loua, Congo (MLCl and MLC5), as well as two from D. simulans (SIM 1 and SIM2) and all from D. mauritiana have deleted sequences between the runs of T's in the untranslated leader region (positions 35 l-379). None of these insertions or deletions is present in copia elements isolated from the Iquitos D. melanogaster line or in any of the elements previously isolated from laboratory strains.\n\nIn addition to the relatively large insertion and deletion variants described above, smaller I-to 3-bp deletions were found to be common in all of the elements sequenced. These small deletions were most often found in areas of T repeats. For example, there is a variable site between positions 148 and 149 that contains an additional T in many of the naturally occurring copia elements. There is also variation among elements in the length of T repeats in the untranslated leader region at positions 354 (6-18 T repeats) and 378 (8-12 T repeats). This variation is most likely attributable to slippage during DNA replication.\n\nThree phylogenetic analyses (neighbor joining, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean [ UPGMA], and parsimony analysis) were used to analyze the sequence data (see Material and Methods). Although the results from these methods differ in detail, they agree that copia sequences from Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana are divergent from the copia sequences from D. melanogaster populations. Since the general conclusions from all three methods of analysis were the same, we show only the results of parsimony analysis in figure 4.\n\nTable 1 Percentage Interpopulational (dxy, plain), Intrapopulational (d,, boldface) and Net (da, underscored) Nucleotide Differences for copia Sequences in Figure 3C Drosophila melanogaster Iquitos, Peru Loua, Congo D. mauritiana D. simulans Iquitos, Peru .........

See Material and Methods for details of calculation.\n\nA number of studies, including comparisons of scnDNA and mtDNA (Caccone et al. 1988), polytene banding patterns (Lemeunier et al. 1986), and comparisons of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh) (Cohn and Moore 1988) have led to the conclusion that D. simulans and D. mauritiana are approximately twice as closely related to one another than either is to D. melanogaster. The gene phylogeny derived from the copia elements analyzed in our study supports the previous phylogenies insofar as D. simulans and D. mauritiana are grouped together, and D. melanogaster is designated as an outlying group. However, D. simulans and D. mauritiana are less clearly distinguished from one another with regard to their copia elements than might have been predicted from the gene phylogenies cited above. Indeed, the level of variation existing between D. mauritiana and D. simulans copia LTRs is significantly less than that existing among LTRs isolated from the Loua, Congo, D. melanogaster line (see d, values in table 1).\n\nDivergence and Diversity of copia LTRs and Adjacent 3' Leader Sequences within and between Species Since copia elements are found in all three species of the melanogaster subgroup used in this study, the simplest model for their evolution is that they were present in the genome as identical, middle-repetitive DNA at the time of species divergence and that they have evolved independently from each other since that point. Under this model the diversity of elements in the same species would be equal to the divergence of elements between species ( Arnheim 1983 ) . The sequences would be randomly distributed throughout a gene phylogeny, unaffected by the strain or species of their origin. We have shown that this is not the case for the copia elements we have examined (table 1, fig. 4). The measure of divergence beyond that found within the two populations or species being compared is d,. All of the d, values comparing Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana sequences to the D. melanogaster populations are significantly greater than zero. Therefore, copia elements have not evolved independently since these three species have diverged from one another.\n\nThe level of intragenomic diversity is significantly different among the strains examined. Copia elements within the Iquitos, Peru, D. melanogaster (d, = 0.60) and the D. mauritiana (d, = 0.66) genomes are less than half as variable as those elements contained within the Loua, Congo ( dx = 1.32)) and D. simulans ( dx = 1.75 ) genomes. Several mechanisms may lead to the homogenization of copia elements within a genome. One possibility is intragenomic selection. It has been proposed that transposable elements may be lost from genomes at a high rate because of negative selection against insertion mutants, recombination, or excision (Charlesworth and Langley 1989). Under such circumstances, the continued presence of elements within a genome would depend on their ability to replicate such that older copies are continually replaced by new ones. Under such a scenario, the most reproductively active copia elements would be expected to be selectively favored resulting in a periodic turnover and homogenization of elements within a genome. This may be a viable explanation for the low variability among the transcriptionally active copia elements within the Iquitos, Peru, genome. The hypothesis, however, seems a less likely explanation of the low variability among copia elements within the D. mauritiana genome in which copia transcripts have not been detected (Csink and McDonald 1990).\n\nAn alternative hypothesis that may account for the homogenization of transposable elements within a genome is gene conversion. Since gene conversion is not known to depend on the transcriptional activity of the elements undergoing homogenization, it could explain the low levels of variability among copia elements within both the Iquitos D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana genomes. However, the fact that we observed no consistent pattern in the levels of intragenomic variation among copia elements across the species analyzed suggests that the causal factors involved are varied and complex.\n\nOur phylogenetic analysis indicates that the D. simulans and D. mauritiana copia elements are significantly divergent from those of D. melanogaster. D. simulans and D. mauritiana elements contain both deletions and base substitutions that were not seen in any of the elements isolated from D. melanogaster. Interestingly, the copia elements in D. mauritiana and D. simulans are not distinct from one another. This may simply be due to the fact that these two species are more closely related than either is to D. melanogaster and that there has been insufficient time for their respective elements to become distinct. The fact that the D. simulans genome contains elements that are structurally similar to those carried by D. mauritiana as well as elements that are structurally distinct may be interpreted in at least two ways. One possibility is that the variability represented by the D. simulan\\s elements represents the ancestral condition and that this variability has been lost in D. mauritiana by intragenomic homogenization mechanisms discussed above. While we currently favor this interpretation, we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more copia elements from D. mauritiana have been introduced into the D. simulans genome by horizontal transfer. Experiments are currently under help distinguish between these possibilities. way to\n\nA number of significant size variants were found among the copia elements sequenced. In one strain of Drosophila melanogaster (MLC9; fig. 3 B) representing the Loua, Congo, population, there is a duplication of part of the 3' end of the LTR. All of the naturally occurring D. simulans and D. mauritiana elements sequenced, but none of those isolated from D. melanogaster contained a 39-bp deletion in the region just 5' to the transcriptional start site (fig. 3A and B).\n\nA 28-bp deletion in the untranslated leader sequence 3' to the copia LTR was found in all of the copia elements isolated from D. mauritiana flies and in two of the three elements isolated from D. simulans. Interestingly, this same deletion was found to be present in two of the nine elements isolated from the low-transcribing Loua population of D. melanogaster. This 28bp deletion encompasses a region (positions 359-377 and 389-407 in fig. 3B) of dyad symmetry ( TTTCACAttctTGTGAAA ) , half of which is similar to the core sequence of the SV40 enhancer (TGTGGAAA) (Weiher et al. 1983). This region of dyad symmetry has been previously hypothesized to be a copia enhancer sequence (Mount and Rubin 1985). Consistent with this hypothesis, Sneddon and Flavell ( 1989) found that deletion of 537 bp just 5' to the copia LTR, which includes this and other regions of dyad symmetry, results in a 5-fold (D. melanogaster cells) to a 25-fold (D. hydei cells) reduction in copia expression.\n\nThe functional significance of the sequence variation we have observed on copia expression in whole flies is currently under investigation in our laboratory. It may be relevant to note that none of the naturally occurring copia LTRs and adjacent leader sequences analyzed in our study contains significant structural aberrations in those regions identified as being critical to copia expression in Drosophila cell lines ( Sneddon and Flavell 1989). However, the possible functional consequence of positional changes induced by the large 39-bp deletion present in all of the D. simulans and D. mauritiana copia LTRs was not addressed in the cell line study. In addition, several of the copia elements we have examined carry a deletion mapping to the untranslated leader located just 3' to the end of the 5' LTR. This deleted region contains a sequence similar to a known eukaryotic hancer and thus may be of functional significance.\n\nen-"
