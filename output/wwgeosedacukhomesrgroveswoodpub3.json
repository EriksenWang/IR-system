    "abstract": "Reefs were decimated by the Frasnian/Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction event (371 Ma), and are assumed to have survived only as depauperate calcimicrobial communities dominated by disaster taxa. Description of Famennian proximal reef-slope communities within the Windjana Limestone, Canning Basin, north-western Australia, shows that, notwithstanding the loss of large metazoans, novel ecologies were established in this setting by a rich biota of survivor and progenitor taxa. Diverse calcimicrobes together with algae, crinoids, bryozoans, brachiopods, and abundant sponges (stromatoporoids, inozoans, sphinctozoans, lithistids and hexactinellids) formed a reef framework of either elevated platy structures up to 4 m in diameter and 0•35 m thick, or mounds up to 15 m in diameter. This framework was dominated by a complex intergrowth of calcimicrobes, where Rothpletzella formed the primary framework, Ortonella, and Girvanella were secondary encrusters, and Shuguria spp. occupied small crypts 2-30 mm in diameter. Contiguous columnar stromatolites up to 50 mm in height and 1 m in width grew upwards from substrate sheltered beneath large sheltered primary cavities: based on minimum growth rates of 50-100 mm/year these are estimated to have been between 500 and 1000 years old. The elevated platy community is inferred to have grown in conditions of episodic siliciclastic sediment input; the reef mounds grew during either episodes, or in localised areas, of low sedimentation. At least 14 morphospecies of spicular sponges are now identified from the Windjana Limestone, where only two were previously documented. These fore-slope reef communities exposed in Windjana Gorge flourished in high-energy carbonate environments dominated by coated grain sediments, and where rapid, early lithification was pervasive.\nSuch observations demonstrate that no protracted interval of time was necessarily required for post-extinction 'recovery' in regions where some reef-building taxa survived and suitable carbonate habitats persisted or returned. Moreover, they show that new ecologies, rather than remnants of the pre-extinction community, could be established rapidly. The reef-slope communities of the Windjana Limestone offer little evidence to support the ideas of resurgence or invasion of taxa from deeper waters after the Frasnian/Famennian extinction. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that similar microbial-sponge communities were already established in margin and reef slope communities in the latest Frasnian. As such, the most dramatic ecological changes caused by the extinction occurred in back-reef communities.",

And while such data can identify mass extinction episodes, they do not reveal details of timing or local geographical information.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, poor phylogenetic knowledge of clades that survive extinction can lead to an underestimation of the number of surviving taxa which may magnify not only the apparent severity of the extinction event (Erwin and Pan 1996;MacLeod et al. 1997) but also estimates of 'endemic' extinctions (Smith and Jeffrey 1997). This is a particularly acute problem with morphologically simple reef organisms such as corals, sponges, and calcified algae, where an abundance of convergent characters results in a notably rudimentary understanding of ancestor-descendant relationships.\n\nMass extinctions are complex phenomena, and often involve the preferential elimination of some parts of an ecosystem, such as phytoplankton at the base of the foodchain, that cause a variety of cascading ecological effects. Yet compilations of numbers of taxa may reveal little of ecological importance for understanding extinction events (Jackson 1995), and indeed changes in diversity may not be a straightforward expression of the magnitude of ecological change (Droser et al. 1997(Droser et al. , 2000)). It is therefore surprising that few analyses of post-extinction recovery have concerned the changing palaeoecology of communities, even though the effect of mass extinctions cannot be appreciated fully without such considerations.\n\nThis paper describes in detail the palaeoecology of a reef-slope community that formed immediately after the Frasnian/Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction event (371 Ma), as exposed in the Famennian Windjana Limestone within the celebrated succession at Windjana Gorge, in the Canning Basin, north-western Australia (Text-fig. 1). The Canning Basin is a key area for understanding the global changes at the Frasnian/Famennian boundary (see Becker et al. 1991;House 1996;Copper 2002;George and Chow 2002), and Windjana Gorge, in particular, presents a unique, apparently continuous sequence of reef-associated facies from the mid-Frasnian to early Famennian. The crisis at the end of the Devonian was one of the most significant during the Phanerozoic (Sepkoski 1982), and this locality also offers arguably the finest outcrops available to study detailed ecological relationships within any Late Devonian reef system. Analysis of such in situ communities overcomes many of the potential problems associated with understanding the ecological effects of mass extinction events, such as the presence of reworked fossils or inadequate sampling, and eliminates the risk of biases introduced by exceptional preservation or facies changes (MacLeod et al. 1997). The study of a continuous carbonate sequence also introduces taphonomic controls (Bottjer and Jablonski 1988).\n\nThere is a consensus that reef communities are particularly susceptible to the factors that cause mass extinction, and that recovery occurs more slowly than in other communities, with reefs often taking 2-10 myr to reappear in the geological record (e.g. Scrutton 1988;Talent 1988;Copper 1989;Kauffman and Fagerstrom 1993;Jablonski 1995;Erwin 1996;McGhee 1996;Hallam and Wignall 1997). Implicit within many of these analyses is the assumption that reefs take longer to re-establish not because of the continuation of environmental stresses hostile to reef formation, but because of the time necessary to restore the high biodiversity and complex ecological interactions that characterise tropical reef communities. Such a contention is not, however, supported by consideration of the Windjana Gorge reef sequence (Wood 2000b). While received opinion is that reefs persisted only as localised, highly impoverished calcimicrobial communities after the Frasnian/Famennian mass extinction (e.g. Scrutton 1988;Geldsetzer et al. 1993;Copper 1994Copper , 1997Copper , 2002;;Fagerstrom 1994;McGhee 1996;Hallam and Wignall 1997), this study demonstrates that in fact a complex and novel community constructed by a diverse biota was established in the reef-slope environment in the immediate aftermath of the event.\n\nThe Mid to Late Devonian (Givetian-Frasnian) is considered to represent possibly the largest global expansion of continental carbonate platforms (Wilkinson and Walker 1989;Kiesling et al. 2000) and reefs (Copper 1989) in the Phanerozoic. During this interval, climate was equable and sea level high: at their acme during the Eifelian-Givetian, reefs periodically extended to latitudes as high as 458S and possibly 608N (Copper 2002). Substantial Late Devonian reefs are found throughout Europe, western North Africa, South China, south-east Asia, and extensive reef tracts, some exceeding in size those of the present day, are known from Canada, central Asia, and the Canning Basin, north-western Australia.\n\nThe crisis at the end of the Devonian is one of the major extinctions of the Phanerozoic, with 57 per cent of genera going extinct (Sepkoski 1995). This extinction can in fact be resolved into three distinct step-down events that occurred during the Givetian, Frasnian/Famennian (F/F), and end-Famennian (Text-fig. 2). Of these, the F/F event represents a significant period of extinction comparable in magnitude to the end-Cretaceous event (Sepkoski 1995). Most extinction occurred during two intervals, the Palmatolepis rhenana and Palmatolepis linguiformis conodont zones of the late Frasnian, and these are known as the early and late Kellwasser events (Buggisch 1991). Extinction is notable in both benthic and pelagic marine groups, but is generally accepted to be most severe in equatorial shallow-marine ecosystems; recent estimates suggest that 60-85 per cent of skeletal and reef-building genera went extinct (Copper 2002). The miospore record also shows major extinctions and floral turnover, suggesting that a significant terrestrial crisis was coincident with the marine event (Bless et al. 1992;Streel et al. 2000).\n\nMany reefs and associated platforms were drowned during the mid-late Givetian Taghanic Event (House 1985), but reef-building had recovered by the early Frasnian. In striking comparison to the widespread distribution of Frasnian reefs, estimated to cover some 5 million sq. km, Famennian shallowwater reefs are relatively rare, known only from the Canning Basin, Alberta and Omolon, north-eastern Russia, and the north Caspian region, and probably covered less than 0•5-1 million sq. km (Copper 2002). However, other estimates suggest that no reduction in the aerial extent of carbonate platforms accompanied this substantial decline in reef development. Based on lithofacies maps, Kiesling et al. (2000) estimated shallow carbonate platforms to have covered approximately 1•18 • 10 7 sq. km during both the Frasnian and Famennian, although carbonate production itself declined by more than 70 per cent after the F/F boundary (Bosscher and Schlager 1993;Kielsing et al. 2000;Copper 2002). Many reefs in Europe drowned during the major early Frasnian transgressions, but a global decline in the abundance of reefs occurred within or below the rhenana Zone, below the F/F boundary (Copper 2002). Reefs disappeared or reduced in size and abundance during a protracted stepdown series lasting more than 1•5 myr but culminating at the F/F boundary, and show a variable regional response, although details remain unclear due to the lack of precise dating of reef-growth cessation in a number of areas (Copper 2002).\n\nAlthough the F/F mass extinction removed a substantial proportion of invertebrate reef-builders and dwellers, diversity had began to decrease over a long interval during the Givetian and Frasnian from a maximum in the mid-Givetian (Fagerstrom 1994) and did not terminate until the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary. During the Frasnian numerous reef-associated brachiopod families were eliminated, most notably from tropical (Copper 1997;Racki 1998) and mid-and outer-shelf settings (Bratton 1996). In the Frasnian of the Canning Basin, however, atrypid brachiopods show relatively low generic diversity (Grey 1978). Bryozoans suffered substantial extinction at the Givetian/Frasnian boundary, but were little affected by the later Devonian crises. Large and complex foraminiferans appear to have gone preferentially extinct during the F/F event.\n\nCorals suffered major extinction. However, the most severe extinction in rugose corals (Scrutton 1998) and stromatoporoids (Stearn et al. 1999) occurred at the end of the Givetian; half of tabulate, rugosan, and stromatoporoid genera were also lost. Only 39 per cent of Devonian coral suborders and superfamilies survived into the Carboniferous (Scrutton 1997). Rugosan diversity peaked in the Eifelian, plummeted around the Taghanic Event, but recovered rapidly to diversify in the Frasnian to yield cosmopolitan faunas largely within a single suborder, the Columnariina (Scrutton 1988;Poty 1999). This radiation was abruptly curtailed coincident with the F/F boundary: of the 43 Frasnian rugosan genera, only 14 are known from the Famennian. The crisis appears to have had a differential effect on rugosan species, removing nearly all shallow-water but only a few solitary, deep-water forms (Sorauf and Pedder 1986). These rugosans subsequently diversified in the Famennian, mainly from deep-water Frasnian species that invaded vacated shallow environments; colonial taxa had re-appeared by the late Famennian (Pedder 1982) and likewise, Heterocorallia flourished in the Famennian (Scrutton 1998). Tabulate corals also suffered major extinction during the Kellwasser event, perhaps as many as 80 per cent of genera having been removed (McGhee 1996). All Famennian survivors, however, crossed the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary (Scrutton 1988). These diversity patterns are similar worldwide, consistent with global, environmentally-driven causal controls, although the Canning Basin reefs show comparatively low generic coral diversity (Hill and Jell 1970).\n\nTotal diversity of stromatoporoid sponges in the Middle Devonian was about 64 genera, with 38 recorded from the Frasnian; the end-Devonian extinction reduced the number of genera to about 47 per cent, and by the end of the Frasnian 74 per cent of remaining genera were lost (Stearn et al. 1987;Copper 2002). The clathrodictyids persisted, but only the labechiid stromatoporoids showed significant recovery after the F/F crisis (Stearn 1987), although this group became extinct in the late Famennian (Fagerstrom 1994). In the Canning Basin, Cockbain (1984) recognised 12 genera and 25 species of Givetian-Frasnian stromatoporoids, but only two species and genera in the Famennian. Early Famennian genera are also small in comparison to the substantial size achieved by Frasnian representatives, although there was limited re-emergence of stromatoporoids as reef framebuilders later in the Famennian (Cockbain 1984;George et al. 1997). In contrast to stromatoporoids, hexactinellid sponges appear to have proliferated during the F/F interval in sites occurring close to the Devonian equator (McGhee 1982).\n\nReef-associated calcimicrobes appear to have been little affected by the extinction but, surprisingly, all went extinct in the mid to late Famennian, a time when other groups were radiating. Only Shuguria (¼ Renalcis) survived into the Tournaisian (Chuvashov and Riding 1984).\n\nThe F/F boundary events remain controversial, both in terms of the timing and number of events, as well as the possible causes. The late Devonian extinctions were clearly complex, with biotas responding in a variety of ways. As a result, several hypotheses have been promoted to explain the extinct events. Some favour a bolide impact as the cause of extinction (e.g. McGee 1996). The most persuasive evidence is the presence of shocked quartz, a modest iridium anomaly, and in particular a spectacular 70-m-thick breccia bed in early Frasnian sequences of Nevada and adjacent states (Leroux et al. 1995). This hypothesis has found little favour, however, as the dating of the impact does not appear to coincide with the major extinction intervals (Joachimski et al. 2001), and the disappearance of shallow marine taxa in a series of step-down extinctions argues against a single catastrophic event.\n\nThe Late Devonian extinctions have been explained most persuasively by scenarios involving rapid sea level oscillations, possibly with associated anoxia, combined with dramatic climate change, particularly global cooling. Sea level rose during the Late Devonian, but the F/F boundary is marked by a shift to high frequency sea level fluctuations, possibly regressive cycles that exposed large continental areas (Johnson and Klapper 1992). Some have argued that the F/F boundary lies within a global relative highstand (Hallam and Wignall 1999); others have recognised a major regression (Racki 1998). The effects of widespread extensional tectonism and volcanism in Eurasia have been proposed by Racki (1998) to have had further disruptive effects.\n\nIt has been suggested that the early and late Kellwasser events are associated with a sea level rise and high global temperatures, and may have been related to the upwelling of basinal, cold, oxygen-deficient and nutrient-rich waters onto shallow, carbonate shelf settings, particularly during subsequent regression (Buggisch 1991;House et al. 2000). This is evidenced by the development of anoxic/dysoxic sediments (including black shales) in Germany, South China, and France, which show a close correspondence to the extinction events (Hallam and Wignall 1997).\n\nAlthough the mechanism to explain the widespread generation of oxygen-poor shelf waters is not clear, such a scenario would explain the preferential loss of warm-water taxa (for example atrypid and pentamerid brachiopods), the preferential survival of dysoxia-tolerant benthos (ostracods and bivalves), deep-water and high-latitude brachiopods, and ammonoids, and the proliferation of deep-water rugose corals, and hexactinellid sponges (normally encountered in deep, cool waters) near the Devonian equator (see McGhee 1996). Only the labechiid stromatoporoids show significant recovery after the Kellwasser crisis, perhaps owing to their preference for cold waters (Stearn 1987). The stepped extinction pattern of cricoconarid families during the Kellwasser crisis might also be indicative of progressive deterioration in water conditions, although little is known of the ecology of this extinct group. Tasmanaceans are usually associated with anoxic and/or cool waters, and chitinozoan blooms may likewise have been triggered by cool or nutrient-rich waters (Hallam and Wignall 1997).\n\nMore recent analyses, however, based on highly accurate global species compilations, point to the main interval of increased extinction being just after the deposition of the Kellwasser black shales (see summaries in Racki and House 2002). At the end of the Givetian, a precipitous drop in atmospheric CO 2 began which is coincident with the Taghanic crisis (Text-fig. 2). This drop in CO 2 continued until c. 320 Ma, marking a dramatic reduction in global temperatures. This, in combination with global regressions, a shift in chemical weathering patterns of the continents, and the start of substantial soil production, all point to a time of massive global disruption (Copper 2002).\n\nAssessment of the effects of cooling, however, requires systematic geochemical data that are not yet available. The limited isotopic data currently available (e.g. Playford et al. 1984;Joachimski and Buggisch 1994) are not conclusive and do not offer evidence for the circulation of an increasingly cooler ocean.\n\nPlate reconstructions for the Late Devonian place north-western Australia in an arid subequatorial belt some 10-158S (e.g. Scotese 1984;Baillie et al. 1994). Reefs developed along the northern margin of the Canning Basin (Text-fig. 1), on the shallow north-eastern flanks of the fault-controlled, north-west-southeast trending Fitzroy Trough (Yeates et al. 1984), which formed during significant crustal extension in the Mid to Late Devonian (Begg 1987;Drummond et al. 1991). This reef-rimmed platform is known as the Lennard Shelf, and fringed the adjacent mountainous Proterozoic landmass of the Kimberley Block to the north-east (Playford 1980;Begg 1987;Playford et al. 1989). A great variety of reefs is exposed, including atolls, and fringing-, barrier-and patch-reefs that formed a belt extending for 350 km and up to 50 km wide. Reef limestones reach a maximum thickness of 2000 m (Playford 1980;Playford et al. 1989), and developed from the Givetian to the Famennian, so recording a history of some 15 myr of continuous reef-building that evolved in an active extensional regime.\n\nDuring the Frasnian and Famennian, contemporary faulting is believed to have produced the mountainous topography in the adjoining landmass of the Kimberley Block, which became the source of vast quantities of coarse-grained siliciclastic sediments. Sandstones and conglomerates were transported across the platform in the form of fan-deltas, which were deposited contemporaneously with carbonate sediment on the platform and slope but limited the landward development of the carbonate platform (Playford and Lowry 1966;Read 1973a, b;Holmes and Christie-Blick 1993). As the reefcomplexes developed in an active rift basin, probably in a series of half-grabens along its length (e.g. Begg 1987;Drummond et al. 1988), it is likely that tectonically controlled uplift and eustacy combined to produce marked relative sea-level fluctuations throughout reef development.\n\nThe carbonate platforms of the Canning Basin were flat-topped, rimmed by reefs, and flanked by steeply dipping marginal-slope deposits composed largely of platform-derived sediments (Text-fig. 3). Fringing reefs developed as narrow, discontinuous rims, commonly only 5-10 m wide (Wallace et al. 1991), that grew on precipitous, eroded and scarp-like margins several hundreds of metres (George et al. 1997;Ward 1999) above the surrounding basin. Contemporary collapse of the early-cemented platform margin, probably triggered by either over-steepening or episodic tectonic activity, produced rock falls and viscous, clast-rich debris flows that led to the deposition of large allochthonous blocks, and interbedded talus breccias and turbiditic grainstones within the marginal-slope deposits (George et al. 1994(George et al. , 1997)).\n\nDuring the Givetian-Frasnian, carbonate platforms in the Canning Basin aggraded almost vertically (the Pillara phase), with backstepping of the reef margins and related pinnacle-reef development in the Frasnian, but during the latest Frasnian or Famennian a rapid progradation of the reef (the Nullara phase) over associated marginal-slope deposits began (Playford 1980(Playford , 1981;;Kennard et al. 1992;Becker et al. 1993;Becker and House 1997). The Famennian reef margin has been interpreted as an advancing rollover margin (Playford 1984). These phases have now been interpreted to be a response to a major transgressiveregressive cycle (Southgate et al. 1993), in response to slower subsidence rates (George et al. 1997). The application of sequence stratigraphy to seismic well data has led to the further recognition that each cycle consists of successively onlapping depositional sequences that reflect short-term sea level cycles (Kennard et al. 1992). George and Chow (2002) have summarised the regional sedimentological changes that occurred across the F/F boundary in the Canning Basin. Stromatoporoid-dominated reef margins appear to have been in decline before the F/F boundary, as composition of allochthonous blocks in the Napier Range fore-reef succession already shows a dominance of Shuguria-microbial limestones in the rhenana Zone. There is no evidence for any break in sedimentation at the conodont-defined F/F boundary in any of studied continuous boundary sequences including Horse Spring, McWhae Ridge, and Casey Falls, or for a single distinctive event bed, but George and Chow (2002) concluded that the F/F boundary occurs within a mappable interval of up to 15 m thick characterised by a marked absence of contemporaneous shallow water carbonate sediments and Frasnian macrofossil content. Although this unit is expressed by varied lithologies the interval is notably condensed, indicative of reduced sedimentation rates and sediment reworking. Siliclastic lithologies and abundant sponge debris are locally present, and there is no evidence for anoxic or hypoxic conditions during deposition. The described F/F lithologies are consistent with starvation of the slope due to reduced carbonate productivity of the platform during a period of lowered relative sea level, supporting interpretations of a major transgression immediately prior to the boundary (Kennard et al. 1992;Southgate et al. 1993) and previous analyses suggesting deposition under fully oxygenated conditions (Becker et al. 1991). These observations are also compatible with other evidence for several rapid and strong sea-level changes during the latest Frasnian (Becker et al. 1991), and for subaerial exposure followed by margin collapse in the Napier Range (George et al. 1997;George and Powell 1997).\n\nWindjana Gorge displays a classic section of Frasnian Pillara Limestone (reef-margin, reef-flat, and back-reef sediments), coeval Napier Formation (reef-slope and fore-reef), and Famennian Windjana Limestone (reef-margin) (Text-fig. 4). The well-bedded back-reef sediments of both the Frasnian and Famennian become progressively more thickly bedded approaching the platform margin, which is characterised by massive sediments with abundant subparallel neptunian dykes and other fissures. Margin-slope deposits are steeply-bedded (up to 30 degrees), and contain allochthonous blocks indicative of collapse of the early-cemented platform margin.\n\nBack-reef ecologies within the late Frasnian Pillara Limestone of Windjana Gorge are dominated by microbial communities (Wood 2000a). Proposed microbialites are expressed as weakly laminated, fenestral micrite that show unsupported primary voids, peloidal textures, disseminated bioclastic debris, and traces of microfilaments. These grew as either extensive free-standing mounds or columns, often intergrown with encrusting metazoans, or thick post-mortem encrustations upon skeletal benthos. In some cases, microbial encrustations are inferred to have developed in protected cavities formed by progressive burial of the reef. The calcimicrobe Shuguria also shows a preferentially cryptic habit, encrusting either primary cavities formed by skeletal benthos, microbialite, or the ceilings of mm-sized fenestrae within microbialite. A further calcimicrobe, Rothpletzella (Rothpletz, 1890) (¼ Sphaerocodium) formed columns up to 0•3 m high in areas enriched by very coarse siliciclastic sediment. Stromatoporoid sponges with a diverse range of morphologies also formed in situ growth fabrics. Monospecific thickets of closely-aggregating dendroid stromatoporoid sponges (Stachyodes costulata), and platy-laminar forms (?Hermatostroma spp.) were common, as were a variety of remarkably large stromatoporoids (Actinostroma spp.) that grew as isolated individuals up to 7 m in diameter (Wood 2000a).\n\nThe palaeoecology of the Frasnian reef-margin itself has not been documented in detail, but appears to have been dominated by the calcimicrobes Shuguria Antropov, 1950(¼ Renalcis of Playford 1980, 1981;Webb 1996;Wood 1998Wood , 1999; re-assigned by Riding 1991) in shallow waters, and Rothpletzella in deeper parts (Playford 1981), together with abundant clotted, fenestral micrite and large, tubular and cup-shaped lithistid and hexactinellid sponges.\n\nThe location of the F/F boundary has been established in the Windjana Gorge succession by conodont biostratigraphy (George and Powell 1997). A thin, laterally continuous stromatolite biostrome is present at the boundary, separating the stromatoporoid-bearing breccias below from relatively poorly fossiliferous strata above (George and Chow 2002), but as in other boundary sections in the Canning Basin, there is no obvious lithological change.\n\nThe Windjana Limestone lithologies are characteristic of energetic, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate, and have been described as representing back-reef, reef-margin to proximal slope environments (Playford 1981). Beds are up to 1•5 m thick, composed of medium-coarse quartz-feldspathic sandstone, peloidal limestone and mudstone, coated-grain (ooids and peloids) packstone, and some grainstone and wackestone. The peloidal limestone is composed of fine sand-sized, round to subangular peloids, intraclasts and skeletal debris, and abundant coarse, angular, quartz-feldspathic clasts. Many neptunian dykes and fissures are common, which are filled with oolites and early cements.\n\nThe reef communities described here grew within proximal-slope settings characterised by silty-sandy, oolitic or grainstone beds dipping from 10 to 30 degrees. These may represent turbidites and debris flows. Some horizons contain eroded, possibly embayed, allochthonous clasts of reef talus ranging from 10 to 250 mm in diameter.\n\nWithin this setting are common beds up to 2•5 m thick consisting of pelleted, fenestral limestones. The irregular fenestrae from 10 to 110 mm in length and from 2 to 15 mm in width form stromatactis structures subparallel to the sedimentary surfaces (Text-fig. 5). The bases of the stromatactis are at a high angle of approximately 45 degrees to vertical, with flat bases and irregular ceilings. The stromatactis forms swarms, which are noteworthy for a regular increase in size from the base towards the top of the mound-like structures (Text-fig. 5A). The fenestrae are lined by radiaxial calcite, followed by a spar infill (Text-fig. 5B).\n\nThe community found in reef-slope settings within the Windjana Limestone is expressed in two constructional forms, described below.\n\nThe most striking Famennian reef community is manifested by diverse calcimicrobes and siliceous sponges that grew to form a previously undocumented reef framework type of laminar, sheet-like growths (Wood 2000b). These structures initiated as small, millimetre-scale laminar growths upon the substrate, dominated by the calcimicrobe Rothpletzella magnum Wray, 1967 (Text-fig. 6). Advancing growth at the edges produced a broadly circular shape in plan, indicative of unconstrained lateral expansion (Text-fig. 7A). As Rothpletzella extended laterally, it also accreted vertically, and small-scale, palercoloured projections on upper skeletal surfaces are interpreted to be early growth phases of such advancing growth (Text-fig. 7B). Rothpletzella formed broadly flat to rounded upper surfaces but highly undulose lower surfaces that enclosed either a single or a series of primary cavities beneath (Text-figs 8-9). With continued growth, the laminar Rothpletzella structures increased in diameter and thickness, to reach impressive sizes: up to 4 m in length and 0•35 m in thickness (Text-fig. 10). Also, further platy outgrowths commonly formed tangential to the 'primary' horizontal growths, to form highly complex, elevated and platy morphologies (Text-fig. 11). The plates are often inclined parallel to bedding.\n\nAs these structures grew, further taxa colonised the primary cavities and open surfaces: the red alga Solenopora geikiei Wray, 1967, and green alga Ortonella imprimis Wray, 1967 (Text-fig. 12) formed cryptic and laterally-projecting growths, and the calcimicrobe Girvanella ducii Wethered, 1890, commonly encrusted Rothpletzella magnum. This diverse calcimicrobe community was joined by a rich variety of other attached metazoan benthos, including rare, small solitary rugosan corals and cryptic The cavities are commonly encrusted by cryptic, pendent bushes of the calcimicrobe Shuguria devonicus Johnson, 1964 (Pl. 1;Text-figs 9F, 14A, C, 16). Primary crypts can be up to 300 mm in diameter and height, and are commonly partially or wholly filled with laminated and graded geopetal sediment, usually graded ooids or peloids, grainstone, or fenestral micrite, with angular silt-grade quartz up to 150 mm thick. A few large gastropods and abundant large ostracods 2-5 mm in diameter are commonly present within geopetal infills (Pl. 1, fig. 2). Remaining cavity space is first filled with a crust of radiaxial fabrous calcite (Text-fig. 12), sometimes followed by a generation of scalenohedral calcite (Pl. 1, fig. 2), then sparry calcite (Text-fig. 12).\n\nWhen the laminar growths reached a thickness of approximately 70 mm, the community was joined by abundant attached lithistid, hexactinellid, inozoan and sphinctozoan sponges (Text-fig. 16A-B). These sponges range from 5 to 110 mm in diameter, and up to 300 mm in length. These projected both downwards within crypts, and aggregated to form clusters upon the upper surfaces of the sheet-complexes, either vertically or horizontally. Many are vase-or cup-shaped; others are branching, tubular or explanate with substantial holdfast structures. Encrusting sponges are often found on the upper surfaces of the platy TEXT-FIG. 9.

Contiguous columnar stromatolites from 20 to 70 mm in width and up to 50 mm in height grew up from the floor of cavities that formed under the more mature platy growths (Text-fig. 16C). These are red in colour, and show wavy micritic-iron oxide-rich laminae from 0•2 to 1 mm in thickness. Sometimes these coalesce into larger domal heads. Many were fully encased within the subsequent geopetal infill.\n\nThe calcimcrobial-sponge community is also expressed as massive, mound-like growths up to 3 m thick and 15 m in diameter. These mounds are dominated by Rothpletzella magnum and Shuguria devonicus Johnson, 1964 together with abundant sponges (Text-fig. 17). The sponges grew either vertically in aggregations on the undulose upper surfaces or within the mounds.\n\nLarge primary cavities and sub-vertical fissures are common (Text-fig. 17B-D). These are often highly complex, composite structures up to 1 m in length and 0•5 m in width. The fissures are often occluded by very thick encrustations of Rothpletzella magnum Wray, 1967, which appears as near-symmetrical, finely laminated growths up to 150 mm thick (Text-figs 17C-D, 18). Remaining void space is occluded by layers of fibrous calcite, often with bioclastic-rich geopetal infills (Text-fig. 17C).\n\nThin, juvenile Rothpletzella magnum laminar growths appear to be characteristic of proximal slope-margin environments, as they are found in inclined beds and associated with eroded, embayed clasts of the calcimicrobial-sponge mounds, sandstone-rich and ooid-rich beds, and toppled sponges. Their growth from such small laminar encrustations, through large platy forms, to full-scale mounds may have been hampered by the high rates or episodic nature of sedimentation. Mature, highly elevated and platy growths are inferred to have grown where swamping by sediments was not prevalent. Reef mound growth is inferred to have formed in either localised areas where sediment input was minimal, or during periods of quiescence.\n\nThe Canning reef complexes show a highly complex history of repeated fracturing, infilling and cementation. Many reefs show spectacular quantities of early marine cements within back-reef, reef flat, reef-margin and reef-slope settings, which reflects the abundance of both large, intact growth framework cavities, and syndepositional fissures and fractures that formed within strongly cemented parts of the reef (Kerans et al. 1986;Wood 1998Wood , 2000a)).\n\nRigidity was imparted to Shuguria by the precipitation of microcrystalline cement. The isotopic signatures of microcrystalline cements support their interpretation as early marine precipitates (Hurley and Lohmann 1989), and these may even have formed contemporaneously with Shuguria (Kerans et al. 1986). Radiaxial calcite is often the next precipitate after microcrystalline cement, forming a single or a few bands particularly within primary reef framework cavities (Pl. 1, fig. 1). These cements formed early within the Famennian reefs, as small-scale fissures are lined with the same generation of radiaxial cement as primary crypts. The spectacular banded fills that account for 20-50 per cent of the total rock volume in many Frasnian reefs are, however, not well developed in the Famennian, due in part to the smaller cavity sizes. Radiaxial calcite cement is usually followed by scalenohedral calcite (marine cement) and clear, TEXT-FIG. 12.

Scalenohedral calcite occurs as crusts that line the primary cavity systems beneath the laminar calcimicrobe-sponge community (Pl. 1, fig. 1).\n\nFamennian reefs of the Canning Basin Globally, the earliest Famennian reefs are documented as being either low diversity calcimicrobial communities, mud mounds, or bryozoan and stromatolite biostromes (see summaries in Copper 2002;George and Chow 2002;Webb 2002).\n\nThe palaeoecology of Famennian reef margin communities in the Canning Basin has not been described in detail, but these reefs are considered to have formed under high energy conditions as massive, cavityrich frameworks dominated by the intergrowth of microbialite, Rothpletzella, Shuguria, and Girvanella, with attendant calcified algae including solenoporaceans (Stephens 2002;Webb 2002;pers. obs.). The width of the Famennian reef margin is not clear, but it was likely to have been less than 20 m and of low relief with a steep margin (Webb 2002). Back-reefs were dominated by shallow, high-energy carbonate facies dominated by coated grains, oncoids and fenestral fabrics. A variety of mud and reef mounds grew in fore-slope environments (see summary in Webb 2002).\n\nThe proximal-slope reef mounds exposed in Horseshoe Range and Horse Spring Range grew in high energy conditions at depths only 10 m below the contemporaneous reef margin, where sediments largely represent those washed over the margin from proximal back-reef settings (Webb 2002). The mounds were elongate and may have graded into the margin itself. They consisted of low-relief structures dominated by either stromatactis-polymud dominated fabrics, or micrite, Rothpletzella, and Shuguria, with some laminar stromatoporoids and multiple generations of cement. Brachiopods and lithistid sponges are rare, and there is evidence for rapid and pervasive early lithification.\n\nOther reef mounds are known from reef fore-slope settings in the Canning Basin. Large stromatolitesponge bioherms of latest Frasnian-early Famennian age have been described from Elimberrie (Playford et al. 1976). These mounds are up to 1 km in diameter and 100 m thick, and developed in relatively deep fore-slope settings. Large, 50-m-diameter stromatolite mud-mounds of similar age have also been described from the Napier Range (George 1999), and small stromatolite-crinoid mounds are known from the Dingo Gap area (Playford 1981;Becker et al. 1991) as well as larger, undescribed sponge-rich mounds (Webb 2002). The calcimicrobial-sponge community described herein from Windjana Gorge thus adds a further reef type to an already diverse set of early Famennian proximal slope reef communities present in the Canning Basin.\n\nBoth George (1999) and Webb (2002) concluded that a variety of microbially dominated reef communities are found in the Canning Basin in both upper Frasnian and lower Famennian strata. This has been corroborated by George and Chow (2002), who observed that in the Napier Range, allochthonous blocks of stromatoporoid-bearing limestone were absent from uppermost Frasnian fore-reef strata, suggesting that extinction of stromatoporoids occurred before the F/F boundary with microbial communities dominating reef margin ecologies before the beginning of the Famennian. They concluded that extinction of most skeletal metazoans was caused by a series of local relative sea level fluctuations that generated further environmental stress either due to siliclastic input, restriction of habitat, or generation of toxic lagoonal waters, superimposed upon a global regime of cooling climate.\n\nIn addition to between ten and 12 taxa of calcimicrobes and algae, the Famennian reef biota of the Windjana Limestone is composed of at least 15 species of spicular sponges, eight taxa of calcified sponges (five stromatoporoids, two sphinctozoans and one inozoan), encrusting bryozoans and attached brachiopods (see Tables 123).\n\nOnly two lithistid sponges have previously been reported from the Windjana Limestone (Rigby 1986), although 20 species of lithistids, seven hexactinellids, and one species of heteractinid have been reported from Famennian slope-margin settings of the Napier and Sadler formations in other locations (Table 1). Of the tentatively identified taxa, 64 per cent represent progenitors. None of the 19 species of stromatoporoid described from the Frasnian of the Canning Basin survived into the Famennian (Table 2;   3). These observations demonstrate the local survival of reef taxa, rather than recovery through subsequent evolution or invasion of new taxa. These Famennian reef communities therefore show no marked reduction in the preservable biodiversity of reef-builders compared to Frasnian counterparts. This can be in part explained by the fact that the F/F extinction preferentially removed metazoans that occupied the back-reef, i.e. stromatoporoid sponges and corals, rather than those present in the reef margin and reef slope communities that were dominated by calcimicrobes and spicular sponges. It may also be noteworthy that unlike other late Frasnian reefs, the corals from the Canning Basin show relatively low species diversity and were not major reef-builders.\n\nReefs disappeared prior or close to the F/F boundary almost globally, but reef loss was not simultaneous, and appears to have followed a series of step-down declines. Reduction in reef growth after the extinction was due to global lowstand reducing available habitat, and possibly to global cooling, but loss of the large skeletal invertebrates resulted in changing reef ecologies, and in the Canning Basin this change was most marked in back-reef settings. The global lowstand close to the boundary caused the widespread erosion of exposed former carbonate platforms (Copper 2002).\n\nThe observation that tropical biotas are more susceptible to mass-extinction events than temperate biotas appears to be based on the high susceptibility of carbonate platform biotas to extinction, rather than all biotas that occupy low latitudes (e.g. Raup and Jablonski 1993;Smith and Jeffrey 1997). In regions where carbonate environments continued uninterrupted across extinction boundaries, there can be considerably less extinction than in areas where carbonate habitat was lost (Smith and Jeffrey 1997). Times of extensive reef building usually correlate with extensive carbonate platform development, often when sea levels were high and climates warm, and high resolution stratigraphic analysis has established that shallow carbonate platforms can be more sensitive to global perturbations than temperate habitats (Johnson et al. 1996). During many mass-extinction events, tropical carbonate platform distribution became restricted, and carbonate platform accumulation rates plummeted (Bosscher and Schlager 1993); for the F/F extinction, estimates suggest that additionally due to global lowstand conditions, carbonate platforms became severely restricted. All these observations suggest a prominent role for loss of habitat linked to climatic or oceanographic deterioration.\n\nThe absence of any obvious lithological change across the F/F boundary in the Windjana Gorge succession suggests that these areas were too shallow to be affected by encroaching hypoxic bottom waters (Becker et al. 1991), and this may further explain the persistence of so many surviving taxa into the Famennian.\n\nComplex ecological interactions are evident within the calcimicrobe-sponge community, with some forms adopting preferentially cryptic habits (e.g. Shuguria spp.), while others developed complex mutually encrusting intergrowths (Rothpletzella and Girvanella). Most noteworthy, however, is the novel morphological expression of this community notwithstanding the similarity in composition to that of the Frasnian reef margin. The formation of highly elevated, platy intergrowths, present novel ecological inter-relationships compared to the Frasnian habits of these taxa. The preference of Rothpletzella for fissures within the community suggests that this taxon preferred a cryptic, shaded habitat.\n\nThe stromatolites also show a clear preference for the sheltered areas formed beneath large primary reef cavities. George (1999) has described the occurrence of stromatolites in a wide range of deep-water depositional settings from the Upper Devonian reefs of the Canning Basin, including several depositional settings within the Famennian, but irrespective of relative depth, all represent areas of either regionally low sedimentation rate or local settings protected from sediment influx. Such an association of deep-water stromatolites with reduced sedimentation is well established (e.g. Playford et al. 1976). Based on  ), and cryptic Shuguria (arrowed) within small primary crypts. The large cavity to the left is lined with a thin crust of radiaxial followed by scalenohedral calcite cement, with a micritic geopetal fill. Note the formation of small laminar cavities within the sediment beneath the calcimicrobial growth; • 5. 2, SMX 36077; arching growth of Rothpletzella (R) forming primary cavities with cryptic Shuguria. Primary cavities are lined with radiaxial calcite cement; • 5.\n\nWOOD, platy calcimicrobe-sponge community biostratigraphy, George (1999) has estimated minimum growth rates of 50-100 mm/year for biohermal stromatolites from the Canning Basin. Given such rates, the maximum age for the largest Famennian stromatolites associated with the Windjana reef communities is estimated to be between 500 and 1000 years.\n\nThe morphological form of the calcimicrobe-sponge platy complexes is also noteworthy for mimicking the elevated Frasnian stromatoporoid sponge growth forms that were eliminated by the extinction event, suggesting that vacated ecospace may have been utilised in a similar way. As such, there was also no change in tiering of the reef community.\n\nPalaeoecological analysis of the Famennian reefs in Windjana Gorge offers little support for either the idea of 'resurgence' or 'reinvasion' of calcimicrobial biotas into reef communities (Copper 1994(Copper , 1997)). Description of Famennian reef ecologies from other localities in the Canning Basin also reached a similar conclusion (Webb 2002). Likewise, the persistence of spicular sponges within reef margin ecologies does not support the notion of the 'invasion' of these taxa into shallow marine habitats from deeper water environments (McGhee 1982(McGhee , 1996)).\n\nNotwithstanding the near-complete loss of large, heavily calcified metazoans in the F/F mass extinction event, the continuation of reef-building across this boundary at Windjana Gorge is testament to the importance of microbial communities in late Frasnian reef building. In fact, many assumptions as to the slow recovery of reefs after mass extinctions have been based upon mistaken identification of marine invertebrates as the main reef-builders, where recovery has been confused with the return of a significant skeletal metazoan component to the reef community (Webb 1996;Wood 1999Wood , 2000a)). Moreover, a diversity of rigid, early lithified microbial and calcareous algal communities continued to build substantial reefs with associated spicular sponges in the early Famennian wherever environmental conditions allowed.\n\nP A L A E O N T O L O G Y , V O L U M E 4 7 TEXT-FIG. 1.
