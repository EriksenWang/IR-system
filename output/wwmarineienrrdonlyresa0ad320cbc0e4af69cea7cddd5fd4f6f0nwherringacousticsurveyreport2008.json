    "full_text": "The northwest and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring acoustic survey programme was first established in 1994. A larval survey programme was initially carried out between 1981 and 1986. In the early 1990s, the ICES herring working group (HAWG) identified the need for a dedicated herring acoustic survey in this area (Anon, 1994). From 1994 to 1996 surveys were carried out on this stock during the summer feeding phase. In 1997 a two-survey spawning aggregation program was established covering both autumn and winter stock components. In 2004, a single spawning stock survey was carried out early in quarter 1 and continued until 2007, whereupon it was decided that this survey should be incorporated into the larger coordinated Malin shelf survey.\n\nThis survey will be the first in a new time series and a step away from the traditional spawning stock surveys. The Irish survey will be carried out concurrently with the West of Scotland (MarLab) and Irish Sea surveys (AFBI) and will be coordinated through the ICES Planning Group of Herring Acoustic Surveys (PGHERS). Combined survey data on herring distribution, abundance and age will be used to provide a measure of the relative abundance of herring within the Malin shelf stock complex. Survey data on stock numbers at age are submitted to the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) and used in the annual stock assessment process.\n\nThe northwest and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring stock is composed of 2 of spawning components (Autumn and Winter spawners), covering a large geographical area and having a protracted spawning season, which extends over a 4-month period from late September through to late March (Molloy et al, 2000). Traditionally fishing effort has been concentrated on spawning and pre-spawning aggregations. In VIaS, fishing begins in late November and continues until late March (winter spawners). Further south in VIIb, peak fishing takes place from October to December (Autumn spawners). The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning stocks in this area (October to February) is highly dynamic with variations between annual spawning events of up to 3 weeks.\n\nUp to 40 vessels commonly participate in the fishery, many of which are based in the Co. Donegal port of Killybegs. The fleet is made up of 20 RSW (Refrigerated Seawater) vessels of 40-70m in length; 20 polyvalent trawlers 10 of which are vessels of 22-40m and 10 of less then 25m.\n\nName Role RV Celtic Explorer Ciaran O'Donnell (SIC) Acoustics Eugene Mullins Acoustics Deirdre Lynch Acoustics Ryan Saunders Acoustics Turloch Smith Biologist Deirdre Hoare Biologist Oral Hanniffy Biologist Marcin Blaszkowski Biologist FV Eternal Dawn Micheal Mc Aullife (SIC) Biologist Francis Mc Daid Biologist\n\nThe primary survey objectives of the Explorer are listed below:\n\n• Carry out a pre-determined survey cruise track based on the known summer herring distribution\n\n• Work in collaboration with the fishing industry, using a scoping survey, to determine the extent and distribution of summer feeding aggregations of herring within the survey confines\n\n• Collect biological samples from directed trawling on fish echotraces to determine age structure and maturity state of survey stock\n\n• Determine an age stratified estimate of relative abundance and biomass of herring within the survey area (ICES Divisions VIIb, c & VIaS) using acoustic survey techniques\n\n• Collect physical oceanography data via a deployed sensor array.\n\nThe primary survey objectives of the commercial scouting survey are listed below:\n\n• Actively search for herring aggregations and mixed herring schools within the survey area working from South to North (ICES Divisions VIIb, c & VIaS).\n\n• Work in collaboration with the Celtic Explorer to determine the extent and distribution of summer feeding aggregations of herring within the survey confines\n\n• Relay information on herring distribution to the Celtic Explorer\n\n• Collect biological samples of herring and species of interest from trawl samples\n\nThe survey was focused on the northwest and west coast of Ireland (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) as shown in Figure 1. The survey track commenced off the west coast of Ireland at the south-eastern extension and worked in continuity from south to north.\n\nTo keep in line with existing survey methodology (MarLab West of Scotland survey) acoustic surveying was only undertaken between 04:00 and 23:00 (daylight hours).\n\nThe commercial survey focused effort in the ICES areas VIIb and VIaS offshore from known autumn and winter spawning grounds where the fishery is focused in quarters 4 and 1. The vessels also covered the grounds extending to the shelf break and northwards to the 56ºN. The commercial vessels worked 24hrs over the 10 day charter period.\n\nA systematic parallel transect design was adopted with a randomised start point. Transects were positioned running perpendicular to the lines of bathymetry where possible. Offshore, transects extended to the 120 to 200m depth contours depending on area, and inshore to approximately the 30m depth contour. Transect spacing was set at 4 and 7.5nmi (nautical miles). As this is the first of a new survey time series it was deemed important to cover the grounds as intensively as possible to highlight any potential areas of distribution or dense aggregations.\n\nIn total, the survey accounted for 2,418nmi, with 2,140nmi of data available for acoustic integration. Survey design and methodology adheres to the methods laid out in the PGHERS acoustic survey manual.\n\nThe commercial survey used a random sonar based search pattern to cover the area shown in Figure 1. The search pattern consisted of vessels being separated by up to 3nmi with sonar ranges set up to 2000m.\n\nIn the north/south aspect of the survey transects were interlaced along the 55º33N with the FV Chris Andra taking this transect to interlace with the RV Celtic Explorer. In the east/west aspect a transect running from 06-07ºW along the 55º29N was taken up by the RV Corystes.\n\nEquipment and system details and specifications\n\nEquipment settings for the acoustic equipment were determined before the start of the survey program and were based on established settings employed by FSS on previous surveys (O 'Donnell et al., 2004). Equipment settings of the Celtic Explorer acoustic array are shown in Table 1.\n\nAcoustic data were collected using the Simrad ER60 scientific echosounder. A Simrad ES-38B (38 KHz) split-beam transducer is mounted within the vessels drop keel and lowered to the working depth of 3.3m below the vessels hull or 8.8m below the sea surface. Three additional operating frequencies were used during the survey (18, 120 and 200kHz) for trace recognition purposes, with the 38KHz data used solely to generate the abundance estimate.\n\nWhilst on survey track the vessel is normally propelled using DC twin electric motor propulsion system with power supplied from 1 main diesel engine, so in effect providing \"silent cruising\" as compared to normal operations (Anon, 2002). Cruising speed is maintained at a maximum of 10 Kts (knots) where possible. During fishing operations normal 2 engine operations were employed to provide sufficient power to tow the net.\n\nThe ER60 was calibrated in Killary Harbour on the 20 th June in near ideal conditions. The results of the calibration are presented in Table 1. The ER60 was last calibrated in October 2007 (O'Donnell et al, 2007). Overall, drift within the system can be regarded as minor between successive calibrations to date.\n\nAcoustic data were observed and recorded onto the hard-drive of the processing unit using the equipment settings from previous surveys (Table 1). The \"RAW files\" were logged via a continuous Ethernet connection as \"EK5\" files to the vessels server and the ER60 hard drive as a backup in the event of data loss. In addition, as a further back up a hard copy was stored on an external HDD and copied to DVD. Sonar Data's Echoview® Echolog (Version 4.2) live viewer was used to display the echogram during data collection to allow the scientists to scroll through echograms noting the locations and depths of fish shoals. A member of the scientific crew monitored the equipment continually. Time and location (GPS position) data was recorded for each transect within each survey strata. This log was used to monitor the time spent off track during fishing operations and hydrographic stations plus any other important observations.\n\nAcoustic data was backed up every 24 hrs and scrutinised using Sonar data's Echoview® (V 4.2) post processing software. Partitioning of data into the above categories was largely subjective and was viewed by a scientist experienced in viewing echograms.\n\nThe NASC (Nautical Area Scattering Coefficient) values from each herring region were allocated to one of 4 categories after inspection of the echograms. Categories identified on the basis of trace recognition were as follows:\n\n1. \"Definitely herring\" echo-traces or traces were identified on the basis of captures of herring from the fishing trawls which had sampled the echo-traces directly, and on large marks which had the characteristics of \"definite\" herring traces (i.e. very high intensity (red), narrow inverted tear-shaped marks either directly on the bottom or in mid-water and in the case of spawning shoals very dense aggregations in close proximity to the seabed). 2. \"Probably herring\" were attributed to smaller echo-traces that had not been fished but which had the characteristic of \"definite\" herring traces. 3. \"Herring in a mixture\" were attributed to NASC values arising from all fish traces in which herring were thought to be contained, owing to the presence of a proportion of herring within the nearest trawl haul or within a haul which had been carried out on similar echo-traces in similar water depths. 4. \"Possibly herring\" were attributed to small echo-traces outside areas where fishing was carried out, but which had the characteristics of definite herring traces.\n\nThe \"EK5\" files were imported into Echoview for echo post-processing. The echograms were divided into transects. . Echo integration was performed on a region which were defined by enclosing selecting marks or scatter that belonged to one of the four categories above. The echograms were analysed at a threshold of -70 dB and where necessary plankton was filtered out by thresholding at -65 dB.\n\nThe allocated echo integrator counts (NASC values) from these categories were used to estimate the herring numbers according to the method of Dalen and Nakken (1983). The following TS/length relationships used were those recommended by the acoustic survey planning group (Anon, 1994): The TS length relationship used for gadoids was a general physoclist relationship (Foote, 1987):\n\nGadoids TS = 20logL -67.5 dB per individual (L = length in cm)\n\nThe same categories were applied to other target pelagic species encountered during the survey. Selection criteria are based primarily upon the species composition of trawl samples as well as target strength (TS) information.\n\nA single pelagic midwater trawl with the dimensions of 19m in length (LOA) and 6m at the wing ends and a fishing circle of 330m was employed during the survey (Figure 11). Mesh size in the wings was 1.6m through to 2cm in the cod-end. The net was fished with a vertical mouth opening of approximately 8m, which was observed using a cable linked \"BEL Reeson\" netsonde (50 kHz). The net was also fitted with a Scanmar depth sensor. Spread between the trawl doors was monitored using Scanmar distance sensors, all sensors being configured and viewed through a Scanmar Scanbas system.\n\nAll components of the catch from the trawl hauls were sorted and weighed; fish and other taxa were identified to species level. Fish samples were divided into species composition by weight. Species other than the herring were weighed as a component of the catch and length and weight measurements were taken for 100 individuals in addition to a 300 fish length frequency sample. Age, length, weight, sex and maturity data were recorded for individual herring within a random 100 fish sample from each trawl haul with a further 100 random length and weight measurements were also taken in addition to a 300 fish length frequency sample. All herring were aged onboard. The appropriate raising factors were calculated and applied to provide length frequency compositions for the bulk of each haul.\n\nDecisions to fish on particular echo-traces were largely subjective and an attempt was made to target marks in all areas of concentration not just high density shoals. No bottom trawl gear was used during this survey.\n\nOceanographic stations were carried out during the survey at predetermined locations along the track. Data on temperature, depth and salinity were collected using a Seabird 911 sampler from 1m subsurface to full depth (with a 2m safety offset).\n\nThe commercial survey was carried out over a 10 day period from June 20-30. The vessels mobilised in Ros a Mhil, Co. Galway and worked in a northerly direction in line with the Explorer. Temporal progression between the Explorer and the commercial pair averaged 2 days overall.\n\nThe FV Atlantic Quest and FV Eternal Dawn are owner operated polyvalent vessels with a long track record in the herring fishery in this area. A picture of the vessels and general specifications are provided in Figure 12.\n\nNon-quantifiable acoustic data from the Simrad ES60 were recorded from both vessels using HDD USB external hard drives installed onboard. These data will be used as a means of visual comparison of mark types observed between vessels.\n\nBiological data from trawl catches were collected using the same sampling methodology applied onboard the Explorer.\n\nTotal abundance, N T , is given by ∑ -types Mark m m T N , , the sum over the total abundance by mark-types.\n\nSuppressing the mark-type index, m, the stratum abundance is\n\n,where l is the transect length and n is the transect mean abundance n.mi -2 which is given by\n\n, where d is the distance of the track fragment and n s,t,j is the mean abundance n.mi -2 for the j th track fragment. Because hauls are assigned with there own stratification that will not necessarily coincide with the acoustic strata, the conversion of NASC into mean density is done at the track fragment level, usually a 1 n.mi segment, but these could be just for the schools themselves. The haul assigned,\n\n, depends strongly on the mark-type (m) and since more than one school can be in a track fragment it needs to be specified. Since age and maturity length-keys are to be applied, the basic estimation is mean density by length bins. The n s,t,j is found by summing over the n s,t,j .\n\n, where i indexes length bins, p i is the proportion of herring in the i th length bin, and is given by\n\n10 )) ( 10 log ( , , 10 i spe L b a i i spe species spe p + ∑ ∑\n\n, where p spe , i applies over all species considered in the haul, L spe,i is the length to use for the i th length bin and the data comes from the haul (of combination of hauls) assigned,\n\nj t m h , , . For non-mix mark-types, the later simplifies to 10 )) ( 10 log 20 073 ( , , 10 i herring L i i herring p + ∑ .\n\nFor biomass, a mean weight is also applied to the n t,j,i using the estimated regression relationship, a L i b .\n\nFor abundance by age and maturity, the abundance by length bin, n t,j,i , is averaged over track fragments and then transects to give a strata (and mark-type) mean. The age and maturity keys are applied to the results.\n\ns s s s W s area V 2 2 = , where ∑ ∑ = j j s t s ts tran l s l l W 2 , , 2 sec ) ( and s 2 is the sample variance.\n\nThe variance for the total is the sum of strata variances. The total biomass can be obtained directly from the track fragment mean biomass by\n\n, where w k is a factor that takes into account the factors for transect and strata averaging, i.e.,\n\nk k s stratum t t k s k k s stratum t t k s k t k s l s l l t k area area l mi n w ∑ = ∑ = . , . , 1 . 1\n\n, where the 1 n.mi is the length of the track fragment. This ignores the mark-type since that is already accounted for in the k n . The k k w n is the biomass from a track fragment and they can then be used to map the biomass at a fine spatial scale. Estimates are made for SSB, total abundance and biomass, abundance by age (ring counts), and abundance by age x length bins. A cv (based on strata standard error divided by the strata mean) is estimated for SSB, total abundance and biomass, and abundance by age.\n\nThirty seven hauls were carried out over the course of the survey (Figure 2, Table 2a). Of this 21 contained herring. Herring represented the second most frequently encountered species after mackerel. Some hauls yielded no catch but were targeted on specific surface marks most likely to be herring but that had evaded the net. This was most notable on marks within 10m of the surface. Over 4,300 length measurements were taken and 1,087 individual herring were aged during the survey.\n\nMackerel were the most commonly observed species on the survey and were found in 26 out of 37 hauls throughout the survey area in both inshore and shelf break areas. Over 2,000 individual length measurements were taken and the mean length for mackerel encountered during the survey was 25.16cm relating to a mean weight of 137g. Length range was 19-39cm overall. Juvenile mackerel were found as mixed surface schools with herring in the northern area of the survey, while mature spawning and pre-spawning individuals were mainly taken in deeper waters towards the shelf edge (>100m).\n\nHorse mackerel were the third most frequently encountered pelagic species with a distribution towards the shelf margins in waters in excess of 100m. Length ranged between 20-38cm, with a mean length and weight of 29.6cm and 237g respectively.\n\nA full breakdown of the survey stock structure is presented by distribution, age, length, biomass, abundance and area in Tables 4, 5 & 6 and Figures 2 & 4a.

This was surprising considering this area supports a small autumn fishery on spawning grounds in and around Galway Bay, namely from Oranmore to Rinville and from Spiddal to Ros An Mhil.\n\nIn the northern area of VIIb (53º30N to 54º15N) herring were observed as large mixed schools with mature mackerel and occurred mainly in waters of over 150m depth, no mixed schools were observed in shallower inshore waters. In the northern extreme of VIIb in rectangle D837, single schools of herring were observed from deeper waters eastwards towards the autumn spawning grounds located from Downpatrick Head to Lenadoon. Overall, this rectangle contributed the highest overall herring biomass observed during the survey relating to 44 definitely herring and 32 mixed herring schools which contributed 25% to the total SSB. Westward transect extension was continued where marks were observed close to the original transect end point until no more fish were observed. This adaptive surveying method was applied as and when required throughout the survey.\n\nThe southern area of VIaS in rectangle D938 was found to contain the greatest distribution of single herring marks totalling 107, composed of low density schools and contributing 11% to the total SSB. Herring distribution was categorised as being well spread from 50-150m depth, with the latter deeper waters containing the greatest biomass.\n\nHerring in the northern area of VIIb, as in the southern area of VIaS, were found in close proximity to the Autumn spawning grounds. In both the above areas herring marks were observed as small single \"chips\" occurring from 5-15m off the seabed and often over a large area. No surface schools were observed.\n\nThe northern area of VIaS (55ºN to 56ºN) can be regarded as a cross over point. Herring schools in this area from 6º-9ºW showed a marked difference to those observed further south in both school structure and behaviour (Figure 4 b & c). Herring in this area were observed as large high density single and mixed schools and fewer low density marks. In general, larger schools were observed higher in the water column than those in the south. The greatest biomass was yielded from mixed schools (with juvenile mackerel) located in close proximity to winter spawning grounds along the north coast.\n\nOverall the northern area of VIaS along the north coast contributed over 46% to the total SSB estimate and contained the only juvenile herring recorded during the survey.\n\nNo juvenile herring were observed west of 9ºW in VIIb or in VIaS. To the east of 9ºW along the north coast, in division VIaS, juvenile herring accounted for 3.6% of the total recorded biomass.\n\nAge analysis of biological samples showed herring within the survey area to be composed of age from 1-10 years (winter rings), as shown in Figure 4a. The stock within the survey area is dominated by 2 winter ring fish, which make up 24.8% by weight of the total biomass and over 31% by numbers (Tables 4, 5 and Figure 4). The second most abundant age class observed was the 3 winter ring fish which represented 23.9% by weight and 24.3% by numbers of the total biomass. The 4, 5 and 6 winter ring herring make up the remaining total biomass, representing 40.1% by weight and 33.2% by numbers. Age structure analysis indicates the bulk of the survey stock is bolstered by the younger 2-3 winter rings herring and not by older individuals.\n\nMaturity analysis indicates the bulk of the survey stock to be mature, 96.4% by weight and 94.2% by numbers. Stage 8, spent/recovering was the most commonly encountered maturity stage representing 48% of the total (based on Landry and McQuinn 1988;ICES 2003). Over 29% were classified as Stage 3 ripening. The remaining stages were made up as juveniles (5.7%) and developing virgins (16.3%).\n\nOne winter ring herring accounted for 2.6% by weight and 4.6% by numbers of the total biomass and were found exclusively along the north coast in Division VIaS between 7-9ºW.\n\nThe presence of 1 winter ring fish has also been picked up in commercial catches in quarter 1 in this area.\n\nIn total 31 vertical CTD casts were undertaken during the survey (Figure 6). Two stations were lost due to poor weather and one due mechanical failure. All data were compiled to produce horizontal plots of temperature and salinity at the following depths; 5m subsurface, 20m, 40m and 60m (Figures 7-10 respectively).\n\nHorizontally compiled data indicate oceanographic conditions typical for the time of year with a moderate thermocline stratifying surface waters. In deeper waters (Figure 10) the West Irish Shelf Front is visible through the tightening of the isohalines off Mayo and provides a good indication of the position of this front.\n\nThe Islay Front in the northern survey area is the most noticeable feature in surface waters north of Malin Head (Figure 8). This is a well-documented front that separates Atlantic water from the Irish Sea.\n\nA total of 10 trawls were carried out over the 10 day survey (Figure 2, Table 2b). All trawls were carried out at the surface with the headline between 4-7m subsurface and with a typical vertical net opening of 25m. Of the trawls carried out 80% were blind tows in areas of known summer distribution and were carried out with no visible marks observed on the vessels echosounders. Two directed trawls were carried out using a combination of high frequency sonar for tracking on marks initially observed on the vessel echosounders (Figure 12).\n\nThe commercial vessels were instructed to carry out blind tows in surface waters to assess the level of non quantified biomass. Information from the skippers revealed that multiple marks were often visible on the high frequency sonar and herring were present but none were actually recorded on the vessels echosounder. This would indicate a degree of vessel avoidance. However, it should be noted that the mark types observed along the northern coast, where the commercial vessels concentrated effort, were of greater biomass and tended to school between 5-20m subsurface than those observed in more southern locales. More southern mark types were observed as deeper and less dense marks occurring 5-15m off the bottom and no surface schooling was observed (Figure 5b).\n\nComapring the age structure of herring taken from the Celtic Explorer and the commercial vessels (Figure 4a-b) show that the Celtic Explorer caught a wider range of age classes over 31 trawls than the commercial vessel (n=10). This may in some way be attributed to the larger amount of trawling undertaken by the Explorer and also that 80% commercial tows were often undertaken as blind surface tow (Table 2b). The age structure of the commercial trawl samples show that 2-winter ring fish dominated catches. Older year classes, of 3 and 4 winter ring fish were not well represented as compared to the Explorer catches. Compartive maturity work was not undertaken due to inconsistencies in matuiry sampling. However, the maturity state from the Explorer samples is robust.\n\nOverall, the survey was a success with only small time losses due to poor weather. Survey aims were achieved as planned.\n\nOf the 606 schools identified during the survey 55% were categorised as 'definitely' herring while only 9% were given to 'probably' herring and fewer still to 'possibly' herring. The remaining 36% represented herring occurring in mixed schools. The high proportion of 'mixed' schools contributing to the total biomass (over 71%) can be attributed to the abundance of mackerel in the area. In the northern area on the shelf, juvenile mackerel were mixed with herring in surface waters with over a wide area. In deeper waters (>100m) in the southern area herring were encountered mixed with pre and post-spawning mackerel.\n\nComparing herring catches in the northern area taken from blind surface tows by the commercial pair and those of the Explorer it appears that most of the herring encountered occurred in surface waters (5-20m subsurface). Discounting the effects of vessel avoidance which would no doubt have an affect fish detection, the acoustic integration takes place from 10m subsurface to 0.5m from the seabed. So any herring occurring from 0-10m would not be available to the equipment. While every effort was made to have the transducers positioned as shallow as possible this was a trade off between data quality and detection due to poor weather conditions. As a result combining both the effects of vessel avoidance and near field acoustic range an unknown proportion of the herring biomass within the survey area was unaccounted for, a phenomenon which is not new to the field of fisheries acoustics.\n\nObservations of behavioural differences between northern and southern areas were notably different. In the southern area, herring were found to be distributed over a larger area in lower density and at greater depths, making for a more accurate estimation of observed biomass. Schools observed in the northern area were often found as mixed assemblages with juvenile mackerel in surface water as higher density schools.\n\nAs part of agreements made at the Planning Group for Herring Surveys (PGHERS) meeting in 2008 transects were interlaced between vessels surveying the Malin Shelf Stock Complex. It is recommended for future surveys that the time lag between vessels observed in 2008 (2 days RV C. Explorer and FV C. Andra and 6 days RV C. Explorer and RV Corystes) be reduced where possible to ensure continuity across the survey.\n\nWhile a large percentage of the biomass in the area at the time of surveying was recorded an undetermined proportion of the total biomass was unavailable to the acoustic equipment. As a result the estimate of abundance, although an accurate representation, should consider this smaller but nonetheless important unaccounted biomass. Once the survey has an established and recognised time-series it is hoped that variations in the year on year estimates will be able to estimate this element of the biomass during the assessment process.\n\nThe bulk of the recorded biomass was observed in the northern area of the survey, which contains the spawning grounds of the winter spawning component. The distribution of herring in this area extended from inshore around the spawning areas northwards to the northern limit of the survey. This is in line with current knowledge of herring summer feeding movements and information from the fleet. A consideration that should be taken into account by the west of Scotland survey which covers this area from 56ºN to 58.30ºN using mainly low intensity (15nmi spaced) transect as compared to the 4nmi transect spacing used by the Explorer.
