    "abstract": "This study was initiated to determine whether the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV) use the same strategy of gene expression as other picornaviruses. The precursor-product relationships apparent from pulse-chase experiments indicated that the virus-specified polypeptides of the GDVII strain are generated by post-translational cleavages. Pactamycin mapping experiments also showed a gene order for GDVII virus similar to that derived for other picornaviruses by this technique. Finally, six other TMEV induced species of polypeptides similar to those of GDVII virus, but there were minor differences in some of their electrophoretic mobilities.\nThe Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV) are members of the picornavirus family and are enteric pathogens of the mouse, their natural host. They are separable into two groups on the basis of the type of central nervous system (CNS) disease they produce in mice after intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation: two of the viruses (GDVII and FA) are highly virulent and produce a rapidly fatal encephalitis\n(Theiler & Gard, 1940)\n, while other isolates found to date are less virulent and produce a biphasic CNS disease\n(Theiler, 1937;\nLipton, 1975;\nLehrich et al., 1976)\ncharacterized by poliomyelitis during the first month post-infection (early disease) and, in surviving mice, a persistent CNS infection and a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disorder weeks to months later (late disease)\n(Dal Canto & Lipton, 1975)\n.\nA better understanding of the pathogenesis of the different diseases induced by the TMEV requires further biochemical characterization of these viruses, and more molecular studies of the infection in the mouse. Since the post-translational processing and gene order of TMEV virusspecified polypeptides have not been well defined, we have carried out standard pulse-chase experiments and used the pactamycin mapping technique to determine whether TMEV follow the unique strategy of gene expression found in other picornaviruses\n(Rueckert et al., 1979)\n.\nBHK-21 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as described previously (Rozhon et al., 1982). All the TMEV stocks were high-titred (10 s p.f.u./ml) and plaque-purified at least twice; their origin and passage history except for TO(B15) virus have been described\n(Lipton, 1978)\n. A suckling mouse brain pool of TO(B 15) virus, kindly provided by Dr B. Mandel (New York City), was passed three times in BHK-21 cells and then plaquepurified twice\n(Feltz et al., 1953)\n.\nIn the pulse-chase experiments, BHK-2t ceils in 35 mm Petri dishes were infected with a multiplicity of 50 to 100 p.f.u./cell. After virus adsorption for 30 min at 37 °C, the monolayers were washed, and DMEM containing 20 mM-HEPES and 5 ~g/ml actinomycin D was added. At 5 to 6.5 h, the infected ceils were washed once and incubated with methionine-free medium for 30 min. Between 25 and 50 ~tCi L-[35S]methionine (1350 Ci/mmol; Amersham) in 0.4 ml was then added for 4 to 8 min in different experiments. For the chase, the monolayers were washed and DMEM containing 20 mM-HEPES and 2 mM unlabelled methionine was added. At the end of the pulse or chase, the incorporation of label was stopped by addition of 0.3 ml disruption",

This gel system proved superior in our hands, for resolving the virus-specified polypeptides between 30K and 40K mol. wt. than did the Laemmli (1970) gel system. The resolving gel (24.5 × 13.5 x 0.075 cm) was prepared to a final concentration of 9~ acrylamide-0-23 ~o bisacrylamide (bis), and a spacer gel (5 x 13.5 x 0-075 cm) was made up to a final concentration of 5 ~ acrylamide-0.13 ~ bis. Both gels contained 0.5 M-urea, 0\"05~ N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine and 0.1 ~o SDS in 50 mM-sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). Polymerization was catalysed with 0-07 ~ ammonium persulphate. The electrode buffer was 50 mM-sodium phosphate (pH 7.1), 0-1 ~ SDS and 10 mM neutralized 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Electrophoresis was at 90 V, with recirculation of upper and lower electrode buffers, until the XC band migrated 18 or 19cm (20h). After electrophoresis, the proteins were fixed with 20~ methanol-8~ acetic acid, and the gels prepared for fluorography by soaking in several changes of distilled water and then in 1 Msodium salicylate-2~ glycerol for 1 h (Chamberlain, 1979). The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat S X-ray film at -70 °C.\n\nPactamycin, kindly provided by J. Grady of The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich., U.S.A. was prepared as a 1 x 10-5 M stock solution in 1 mM-acetic acid and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. The lowest concentration of drug that produced complete inhibition of protein synthesis of GDVII virus-infected BHK-2I cell monolayers but allowed previously initiated ribosomes to complete translation of the message was determined as described by Butterworth & Rueckert (1972). In brief, at 5.5 to 7 h post-infection, infected monolayers were incubated with 10 ~tCi L-[35S]methionine, with pactamycin or DMEM (control), and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. At 2 min intervals, incorporation of label in drug-treated and control cells was stopped by addition of 20 ~ trichloroacetic acid (TCA). TCA-precipitable radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter.\n\nTo determine the amount of label incorporated into virus-specified polypeptides in drugtreated and control monolayers, cellular extracts solubilized in disruption buffer were electrophoresed on slab gels. The fluorographs of the gels were scanned with a Joyce-Loebl microdensitometer such that full-scale pen deflection was within the linear range of the film and the densitometer. The radioactivity in each protein band was determined from the area measured with a manual planimeter (Gelman Instrument Co.), and the proportion of the total area represented by each virus peak on the trace was calculated.\n\nIn preliminary experiments, the optimum time for labelling GDVII virus with L-[35 S]methionine in the presence of actinomycin D was determined. Virus-specified polypeptides were preferentially labelled between 5.5 and 7 h post-infection when there was more than 90~o inhibition of host protein synthesis (data not shown). At this time the cell monolayers had moderate cytopathic changes. Fig. 1 shows a fluorogram of cellular extracts from a representative pulse-chase experiment. The flow of the label from polypeptides of higher molecular weight to those of lower molecular weight is obvious. Thirteen bands were reproducibly identified as virus-specified in this and subsequent experiments. The rapid rate of disappearance of label from P93 coincided with the rate of appearance of label in the capsid proteins, VP0, VP1 and VP3. VP0 remained stable throughout the chase and little label appeared in VP2 and VP4 even with chases longer than 90 min. The early appearance and slower decay rate of P84, P70 and P56 and their similarity in size to the polypeptides specified by the 3' end of the genome (third part or domain) of other picornaviruses (Rueckert et al., 1979;Sangar, 1979) suggested that P70 and P56 were products of P84. It is noteworthy also that a protein of approximately 20K mol. wt. equivalent to the protease of polio and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viruses, could not be resolved (or separated from VP3) even when the urea concentration in the gel was increased to 5 to 8 M as described by Palmenberg (1982). Finally, the amount of P40, which appeared in the pulse, did not change appreciably during the chase, and was deduced to be from the middle o f the g e n o m e (see below). Precursors o f P40, similar to those described for polio and E M C viruses by Rueckert et al. (1979), were not seen in the G D V I I virus-infected cell extracts.\n\nNext, we used the pactamycin technique to determine the order of G D V I I polypeptides coded for by the genome. In preliminary experiments, we found that 1 x 10 -6 M-pactamycin was the lowest concentration that preferentially inhibited initiation of protein synthesis in virus-infected\n\nP93 P40 P84 5' 3' 0.33 1.50 2.68 P75 VPI P70 0.60 1.25 VP0 VP3 P56 0-44 0.95 2.89 vP4 vP2 P12 1.88\n\nFig. 2. Pactamycin mapping order of GDVII virus polypeptides from the 5' end of the genome. The pactamycin map value is listed below each polypeptide line. One ~tM-pactamycin was used to determine the pactamycin/control ratio for incorporation of L-[asS]methionine into the virus-specified polypeptides. The labelling of polypeptide bands on gels was quantified by fluorography followed by scanning of the film with a Joyce-Loebl microdensitometer. Peak areas were used as a measurement of the radioactivity in a band, and the percentage of this area relative to the total for all virus polypeptides on a gel was calculated. Note that no pactamycin map values are given for P70, VP2 and VP4 (see text).\n\nmonolayers (data not shown). We then used this concentration to determine the pactamycin-/control ratio for incorporation of label into each virus-specified polypeptide (Fig. 2). For the primary products, P93 and P84, and P75 the ratios were from a 5 min pulse begun 6 rain after pactamycin was added to the monolayers. For the other virus-specified polypeptides, most of which were stable products, the ratios came from a 20 min pulse followed by a 45 rain chase where the drug and label were added simultaneously. Because of minimal VP0 cleavage, ratios for VP4 and VP2 could not be determined, but their position on the genome as shown seems likely. For unclear reasons, P70 gave irregular results, so its map position as shown in Fig. 2 is only tentative. Six additional TMEV, including virulent FA virus, were then radiolabelled and electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide slab gel to determine whether their species of polypeptides resembled those of GDVII virus. All of the polypeptides found with GDVII virus were induced by the other six isolates (Fig. 3). The less virulent TMEV inhibited host cell protein synthesis less efficiently (Fig. 3 c to g), and, as expected, produced several polypeptides with minor differences in migration compared to products of GDVII and FA viruses. Notably, P12 of the less virulent TMEV migrated further than P12 of GDVII and FA viruses, while VP0 and its precursor, P93 of the less virulent isolates, migrated less than their counterparts in GDVII and FA. In addition, in only DA and WW viruses did VP1 and VP3 migrate further than these polypeptides in the two highly virulent TMEV. The capsid polypeptide differences between the two groups shown here are consistent with the findings reported previously for purified virions (Lipton & Friedmann, 1980).\n\nThus, pulse-chase experiments suggest precursor-product relationships which indicate that post-translational cleavages generate GDVII virus-specified polypeptides. Apparently, a polyprotein is made and cleaved into three primary products, corresponding to the three parts or domains of the genome, and these in turn are cleaved to give four structural or capsid polypeptides and a number of non-structural polypeptides similar to those of other picornaviruses. In addition, the gene order shown for GDVII virus is similar to that derived for other picornaviruses by the pactamycin mapping technique (Summers & Maizel, 1971 ;Taber et al., 1971;Butterworth & Rueckert, 1972;Sangar et al., 1977).\n\nWith several exceptions, our results agree with those in a study by Lorch & Friedmann (1983) in which TMEV were labelled after 24 h of replication in BHK-21 cells. In their gel system protein 17 probably represents the co-migration of VP0 and P40, since we have found it difficult to separate these polypeptides in SDS Laemmli gels with different concentrations of acrylamide and different gradients (unpublished data). Protein 18 rather than protein 20 as designated in their Fig. 1 is probably VP1, for protein 20 did not appear in the infected cell extracts. This interpretation also suggests roughly equimolar proportions of VP1, VP2 and VP3, considering that labelling was with [3 5 S]methionine. However, in contrast to our results, Lorch & Friedmann (1983) did not find differences in molecular weights or isoelectric points between the polypeptides of two highly virulent TMEV (GDVII and FA viruses) and two less virulent ones (DA and WW viruses). These differences might be expected, since there is only a 2 0 ~ homology in the RNase T1 oligonucleotide maps between the two groups of TMEV (Rozhon et al., 1982;Lorch et al., 1982;our unpublished data), a relationship equivalent to a 1 0 ~ difference in the R N A sequence (Aaronson et al., 1982). The major differences found between the two groups of TMEV appear to be in the structural polypeptides, which is consistent with the findings from comparison of nucleotide sequences between strains of foot-and-mouth (Marquardt, 1982) and poliovirus types 1 and 3 (Stanway et al., 1983).\n\nThis research was supported by United States Public Health Service grant AI 14139.
