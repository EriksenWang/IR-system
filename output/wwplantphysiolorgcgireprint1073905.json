    "abstract": "A full-length cDNA (icdb-7) encoding a cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH-1) from potato (Solanum tu- berosum L.) has been isolated. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence revealed considerable homologies with the corresponding proteins from other eukaryotes such as tobacco, alfalfa, soybean, cattle, pig, and yeast. The gene was transcribed in all tissues tested, with the highest amount of icdb-1 transcript being found in green tissues, i n flowers, and i n roots. In leaves, enzyme activities were dependent on the age, with fully mature leaves showing the highest level of RNA expression and enzyme activity. This observation may indicate that NADP+-dependent ICDH is not only involved in amino acid biosynthesis via the glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase cycle but also in cycling, redistribution, and export of amino acids. The latter assumption has been strengthened by our finding of a preferential expression of NADP+-dependent ICDH in leaf veins. Under in vivo conditions, the expression pattern paralleled the enzyine activity, indicating coarse control on the RNA level. Experiments carried out with detached leaves revealed an influence of light, nitrate, and sucrose on icdh-1 transcript levels and i n some cases also on NADP+-dependent ICDH activity. I n darkness, nitrate or sucrose induced icdb-7 mRNA expression.\nLeaves kept under starvation conditions exhibited a decrease of their protein content, whereas icdh-1 expression and ICDH activity increased significantly.\nNADP+-dependent ICDH (EC 1.1.1.42) catalyzes the reversible conversion of isocitrate to 20G. Under in vitro conditions, the equilibrium of the reaction depends mainly on the pH of the assay solution\n(Siebert et al., 1957)\n. For etiolated pea seedlings, the pH optima for the forward and reverse reactions were found to be 8.4 and 6.0, respectively\n(Omran and Dennis, 1971)\n. However, the enzyme is most stable between pH 7 and 8\n(Satoh, 1972;\nHenson et al., 1986)\n.\nNADP'-dependent ICDH has been found in prokaryotes and in different compartments of eukaryotes such as the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (",
    "full_text": ". In dicotyledonous plants, NADP+-dependent ICDH has been described mainly in members of the Fabaceae (Pisum sativum: Omran and Dennis, 1971;Randall and Givan, 1981;Chen et al., 1988Chen et al., , 1989; Medicago sativum: Henson et al., 1986;Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992; Cicer arietinum: Gupta and Singh, 1988; Glycine max: Udvardi et al., 1993). With respect to the subcellular distribution of ICDH activity, about 90% is present in the cytosol, 10% is found in chloroplasts, less than 1% is present in peroxisomes, and even less is found in mitochondria (Satoh, 1972;Randall and Givan, 1981).\n\nThe enzyme exhibits an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions (Mn2+ or Mg2+) (Siebert et al., 1957;Marr and Weber, 1968;Omran and Dennis, 1971;Satoh, 1972;Henson et al., 1986;Udvardi et al., 1993). In Escherichia cozi, it is assumed to be a Krebs cycle enzyme, regulated via reversible phosphorylation, depending on the growth conditions (Garnak and Reeves, 1979;Thorsness and Koshland, 1987). For SalmoneZla typhimurium and the protozoan Crithidia fasciculata, a regulation by cellular ATP and 20G has been suggested (Marr andWeber, 1968, 1969a). The authors proposed that the enzyme is responsible for the generation of precursors for various biosynthetic pathways and influences lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (see also Miiller et al., 1968;Gonzalez-Villasenor and Powers, 1986).\n\nFor higher plants, information concerning the regulation of ICDH is restricted to a few species. These investigations were performed with the purified enzyme, and therefore, only limited conclusions can be drawn for the in vivo conditions. ICDH is inhibited by glyoxylate and oxaloacetate (Omran and Dennis, 1971;Satoh, 1972) and the reaction products, NADPH and 20G, respectively (Henson et al., 1986;Gupta and Singh, 1988). Citrate is a competitive inhibitor of ICDH activity (Henson et al., 1986). Gupta and Singh (1988) postulated that the activity of NADP+-dependent ICDH is also controlled by the intracellular NADPH/ NADP+ ratio. Finally, at nonsaturating isocitrate concen-Plant Physiol. Vol. 107,1995 trations, Gln was a positive effector of the enzyme (Henson et al., 1986).\n\nDirect evidence for a possible function of the cytosolic enzyme in plants is still missing. Similar to the protozoan and animal system, NADPf-dependent ICDH from higher plants has been suggested to play a role in replenishing the cytosol with reducing power (i.e. NADPH), especially during metabolic limitation of the pentose phosphate pathway (Omran and Dennis, 1971). The enzyme may also be responsible for supplying carbon skeletons for NH, assimilation (Hanning and Heldt, 1993). Hence, 20G may function as a key metabolite linking nitrogen and carbon metabolism (Chen et al., 1988). Since the chloroplast envelope has a carrier system for 20G, NADE''-dependent ICDH could provide the cytosol and chloroplasts with the primary acceptor for reduced nitrogen and thus be of crucial importance with respect to amino acid biosynthesis and export (Elias and Givan, 1977;Henson et al., 1986), as well as NH, detoxification (Givan, 1979).\n\nOnly recently has plant ICDH been analyzed at the DNA and RNA levels (Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992;Udvardi et al., 1993), opening new possibilities for a deeper understanding of the role of this enzyme during plant growth and development. Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a cytosolic NADP+-dependent ICDH from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). In addition, we describe ICDH expression patterns and activities in different potato tissue types and under various physiological conditions. Using the data available to date, we discuss the role of cytosolic ICDH in plant tissues.\n\nPotatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Désirée) were obtained from Saatzucht Fritz Lange KG (Bad Schwartau, Germany) and grown in pots (16 cm in diameter) under greenhouse conditions (22°C day/l5\"C night, 50-80% RH, 16-h light period).\n\nA A Zap I1 cDNA library prepared from leaves of potato (Kogmann et al., 1992) was used for screening. Approximately 5 x 105 recombinant A pages were screened with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment (approximately 1 kb long) encoding NADE'+-dependent ICDH from tobacco (S. Gálvez, M. Hodges, E. Bismuth, P. Decottignies, R.S. Sangwan, F. Dubois, C. Crétin, and P. Gadal, unpublished data). Filters were hybridized overnight at 42°C in PEG buffer containing 22% (v/v) formamide (Amasino, 1986) and washed at 42°C for 30 min in 5X SSC and 0.5% (w/v) SDS and for 30 min in 3X SSC and 0.5% SDS. Plaque-purified phage clones were converted to pBluescript derivatives according to manufacturer's (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) instructions. Individual phagemid clones were tested for cDNA inserts by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. One of the clones isolated (clone pICDH-I) was used for the experiments described in this report.\n\nDNA sequences were obtained using either the original plasmid pICDH-1 or subclones generated in tl-e plasmid pBluescript SK (Stratagene) as templates. Plasmid DNA was prepared via the alkaline lysis method (Sambrook et al., 1989). Dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) was performed by using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Primers recognizing plasmid sequences within the polylinker region were obtained from Pharmacia, and primers directed to intemal cDNA sequences were synthesized by Tib Molbiol (Berlin, Germmy).\n\nSequence alignment and comparison with ICDH sequences from other organisms was performed b y using the GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) and the GENEMBL data library (Devereux et al., 1984).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen plant material as described by Logemann et al. (1987) and denatured in a mixture of 39% formamide and 4.4% formaldehyde. RNA was separated on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham, UK) with 20X SSC (3 M NaCl and 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0). Membranes were prehybridized (42\"C, 4 h) and hybridized (60\"C, overnight) in phosphate buffer (250 mM NaH,P0,/Na2HP04, pH 7.2) containing 1 mM E,DTA, 6.8% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (w/v) BSA. The icdh-l CDNA was excised from pICDH-1 via EcoRI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The [a-32P]dCTP-labeled cI>NA probe was prepared using a multiprime-labeling kit (13oehringer, Mannheim, Germany). After hybridization, inembranes were rinsed in l x SSC (150 mM NaCl and 15 rnM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), containing 0.5% SDS, subsequently washed with the same solution for 1 h at 60°C to remove nonspecific hybridization, and then subjected to autoradiography. Signal intensity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with the help of the MD ImageQuant Software, version 3.3.\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from potato leaves using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method of Rogers and Bendich (1985). DNA was digested (10 pg each) for 6 h at 37°C with different restriction enzymes and scparated on a 0.8% agarose gel. After the gel was consecuiively incubated (30 min each) in 25 mM HC1 and in denaturating solution (1.5 M NaC1, 0.5 N NaOH), the DNA was transferred onto a Biodyne B nylon membrane (PALL, Dreieich, Germany) with 20X SSC. Hybridization with ihe radiolabeled icdk-1 cDNA (see above) was performed cwernight at 42°C as described by Amasino (1986). After hy xidization, membranes were washed twice in 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS (42\"C, 30 min) prior to autoradiography.\n\nLeaf discs (0.7 cm in diameter) were punchecl out with a cork borer. Nodes, internodes, roots, and tubers were cut with a razor blade, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°C until required. Frozen plant material w3s homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM Hepes/KOFI, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCI,, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% [v/vl glycerol, 5 mM DTT). The homogenates were centrifuged twice for 20 min at 16,000 rpm in a refrigerated microfuge at 4°C. ICDH activity in the supernatant was measured following the method of Chen et al. (1988) by monitoring the isocitrate-dependent rate of NADP+ reduction. Routinely, the assay mixture contained 20 pL of crude extract, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (K,HP0,/KH,P04, pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCI,, and 0.1 mM NADP+ in a total volume of 420 pL. After equilibration at 30°C, the reaction was started by adding 8 pL of 100 mM isocitrate (the same volume of water was added to the reference samples). Either the protein content (determined as described by Bradford, 1976) or leaf surface area served as reference for the calculation of ICDH activities.\n\nFour-to 6-week-old potato plants were kept in the dark for 24 h, and then the leaves were detached by cutting the petioles under water. In each experiment, 5 to 6 leaves from 6 to 12 plants were randomly selected and incubated at room temperature under continuous light or in darkness.\n\nThe leaves were kept either in tap water or in 7.5 mM Ca(NO,),, in 5% SUC, or in 7.5 mM Ca(NO,), plus 5% SUC, a11 made using tap water. At selected time intervals, the terminal leaflets were removed and cut in half. For the ICDH enzyme assay, samples were taken from each leaflet individually; for RNA extraction, leaflet halves from 6 plants were pooled for each time point.\n\nUsing a heterologous probe from tobacco, we isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding NADE'+-dependent ICDH (ICDH-I) from potato. The icdk-2 cDNA had a length of 1569 bp and was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 416 amino acids, corresponding to about 45.5 kD. This finding fits well with determinations from other authors (Haselbeck and McAlister-Henn, 1991: yeast, 45 kD;Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992: alfalfa, 46 kD;Huh et al., 1993: bovine kidney, 46 kD). The 3' untranslated region of the cDNA includes the polyadenylation signal AATAAA (position 1378-1383). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with ICDH sequences from other eukaryotes (Fig. 1) revealed considerable homologies over long stretches of the polypeptide. The overall sequence identity amounts to about 97% for tobacco (S. Gálvez, EMBL Data Library, accession No. X77944), to 90% for soybean (Udvardi et al., 1993) and alfalfa (Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992), to more than 65% for cattle (Huh et al., 1993), pig (Haselbeck et al., 1992), and yeast (Haselbeck and McAlister-Henn, 1991), and finally to 25% for Escherickiu coli (Thorsness and Koshland, 1987). Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA from potato probed with the complete icdh-2 cDNA fragment showed only a few bands (Fig. 2), indicating that icdh-I cDNA from potato with ICDH sequences from other organisms. The nucleotide sequence of potato icdh-7 was submitted to the EMBL Data Library and assigned the accession No. X75638. All sequences are from NADP+-dependent enzymes. The proteins from animais and yeast represent mitochondrial isozymes. Bos, Bovine (Bos taurus); Pig, porcine; Pot, potato (S. tuberosum); Tob, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum); Cly, soybean (G. max); Med, alfalfa (M. sativa); yea, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae); Eco, E. coli. Sequence alignment was done using the programs PILEUP and PRETTYPLOT of the CCG (Genetics Computer Group) software package, version 7.1 (Devereux et al., 1984). Numbers indicate amino acid positions. Dashes (-) were introduced to maximize homologies.\n\nICDH is encoded by either one gene or a small gene family (see also Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992;Udvardi et al., 1993).\n\nA hydropathy plot (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) of the inferred potato protein revealed a predominance of hydrophilic amino acids (data not shown), making a tight membrane association of the enzyme unlikely. This observation was in accordance with the lack of a difference in ICDH activities in the presence or absence of 0.1% Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer (data not shown).\n\nUnder the assay conditions for NADP \"\"\"-dependent ICDH, no NAD \"\"\"-dependent activity was detectable in total leaf extracts (data not shown; see also Satoh, 1972). NADP\" 1 \"-dependent ICDH activity was not tested in mitochondrial extracts from potato. In castor bean seeds and in P. sativum leaves, mitochondria! NADP\" 1 \"-dependent ICDH contributed far less than 1% of the total activity (Satoh, 1972;Randall and Givan, 1981).\n\nThe contribution of a possible plastidic ICDH isoform to the conversion of isocitrate to 2OG was determined by assaying NADP + -dependent ICDH activity in isolated chloroplasts. ICDH activity in the chloroplast pellets was less than 5% of the total activity (data not shown), which fits well with results obtained by Randall and Givan (1981) and Chen et al. (1989) using pea tissue. A preponderance of the ICDH-1 isozyme in the cytosol has been supported by the analysis of potato plants carrying an icdh-1 antisense construct. Antisense plants exhibited no decrease in their chloroplastic ICDH activities, whereas total activities were reduced by as much as 93% compared to wild-type plants (S. Fieuw, L. Willmitzer, and B. Mtiller-Rober, unpublished data).\n\nSequence comparisons of the cytosolic ICDH from tobacco (S. Galvez, EMBL Data Library, accession No. X77944) and the potato ICDH-1 revealed that the C-terminal ends of the deduced proteins were nearly identical (Fig. 1). By contrast, the tobacco isozymes presumably originating from other organelles clearly differed in this region (data not shown). In addition, in tobacco, polyclonal antibodies raised against the chloroplastic ICDH isoform showed no cross-reactivity with the cytosolic enzyme (Galvez et al., 1994).\n\nSeveral organs of greenhouse-grown potato plants were analyzed with respect to icdh-1 mRNA expression. As can be seen in Figure 3, the highest transcript levels were present in flowers (especially in the androecium), in internodes, and in roots. Tubers exhibited very low amounts of icdh-1 transcript, whereas stolons and leaves showed an intermediate level of expression. During tuber development, the amount of icdh-1 mRNA decreased. We also determined NADP + -dependent ICDH activities for the various organs of the potato plant (Fig. 4). Enzyme activity data approximated the northern analysis data in that the highest activities were detected in roots, stolon, and green parts of the plant, whereas the lowest activities were found in developing tubers. Total protein content was used as a reference for the calculation of ICDH activities. In leaves, more than 50% of the total protein was localized in the chloroplasts. Therefore, the activity of cytosolic ICDH in leaf extracts was probably underestimated compared to heterotrophic tissues (e.g. the protein content was 8.5 versus 1.0 mg protein per g fresh weight in leaves versus roots, respectively). i 200.0-150.0-100.0-50.0-Figure 4. NADP + -dependent ICDH activities in protein extracts of different tissues of potato plants. Mean of 5 to 12 independent measurements (±SE). YL, Young source leaves; ML, mature source leaves; SL, senescing leaves. Other abbreviations are as in Figure 3. Tuber fresh weights were: D1, 43 to 63 g; D2, 10 to 20 g; D3, 0.7 to 8.0 g, and D4, 0.01 to 0.15 g.\n\nWe wanted to know whether leaf-specific expression of ICDH changes during plant development. To this end, source leaves were harvested from a middle position of potato stems from plants of different ages. As can be seen in Figure 5a, the highest amounts of RNA were found in source leaves from 8-week-old plants. When calculated on a protein basis, the increase of icdh-l mRNA level toward the end of the vegetation period was accompanied by an increase in NADP + -dependent ICDH activity (Fig. 5b). On a leaf area basis, however, a slight decrease in ICDH activities was observed.\n\nWhen ICDH was assayed in successive source leaves from about 8-week-old plants, the highest activities, on a protein basis, were found in the older leaves at the base of the plant (Fig. 6). Again, the opposite was true when the leaf surface area was taken as a reference. On the RNA level, potato plants displayed the highest amounts of icdh-l transcript in young immature (sink) leaves at the top and in senescent leaves at the base of the plants (data not shown). Relative to their protein content, leaflets of the same source leaf also exhibited slight differences in their ICDH activities, the highest being observed in the big, terminal leaflet (Fig. 6, inset).\n\n1 To obtain a more detailed picture of the distribution of NADP + -dependent ICDH within different tissues of the potato leaf, we compared icdh-l transcript levels in the leaf vasculature (i.e. midrib and first-order veins) with those present in whole leaves. The results of two independent experiments are shown in Figure 7a. In both experiments, the icdh-l steady-state mRNA levels were higher in the vascular tissue than in total leaves. To determine whether this higher expression is also reflected on the enzyme level, we measured NADP + -dependent ICDH activities in the different preparations. As can be seen in Figure 7b, ICDH activities were higher in the vasculature than in whole leaves.\n\nDetached leaves incubated in water or in water supplemented with NO 3 and/or Sue were analyzed after light or dark treatment. We wanted to determine (a) whether icdh-l mRNA levels are affected by the various treatments and (b) whether changes in icdh-l mRNA levels resulted in corresponding changes in NADP + -dependent ICDH activities. Preliminary experiments revealed that in both the light and the dark icdh-l mRNA expression decreased significantly after 48 h of incubation in tap water or in NO 3 ^ solutions (data not shown). However, a transient increase in icdh-l transcript level was found during the initial 6 to 24 h of incubation in 3 mM NO 3 ~. A 5-fold increase of the NO Plant Physiol.

T, Terminal leaflet; I, first pair of leaflets; II, second pair of leaflets.\n\nconcentration (15 mM NO 3 ~) did not further stimulate icdh-1 expression (data not shown).\n\nOn the RNA level, three main observations were made (Fig. 8): (a) With leaves kept in tap water under continuous darkness, an initial decrease of RNA expression was followed by a significant increase after 24 h. In contrast, an immediate increase in icdh-1 transcript levels occurred when leaves were incubated in light, which was followed by a continuous decline, (b) In darkness, NO 3 ~ and Sue were able to induce icdh-1 expression and, therefore, mimic the light effect, (c) In the light, Sue stimulated RNA expression to a lesser extent than in the dark. In the dark, Sue delayed the decrease of RNA expression, which was observed in tap water and nitrogen.\n\nThe leaf material that was investigated for icdh-1 transcript levels (Fig. 8) was also analyzed with respect to NADP + -dependent ICDH activities. The results are shown in Figure 9. In most cases, no major changes in enzyme activities were detected. In dark-treated leaves (Fig. 9a), a significant increase in activity was observed only upon 24 h of incubation in tap water or Sue. In the light (Fig. 9b), ICDH activity significantly increased only in leaves that were incubated in Sue for 24 h.\n\nThe high degree of sequence homology of NADP + -dependent ICDH from potato with ICDH proteins from other plants, animals, and yeast shows that the enzyme is a highly conserved protein. The cytosolic isoform, representing the major activity of higher plant NADP + -dependent ICDH activity, may have a central role in integrating mitochondrial (production and release of citrate) and chloroplastic (uptake of 2OG, and conversion of 2OG to amino acids) metabolism (Fig. 10).\n\nFor potato plants, we show that NADP + -dependent ICDH is an enzyme that is present in both autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues. The activities observed were in good agreement with data obtained for crude extracts of pea (for comparison, see Chen et al., 1988). Potato leaves displayed slightly higher ICDH activities than those of tobacco (0.43 versus 0.11 ju,mol min\" 1 g\" 1 fresh weight; Galvez et al., 1994). In alfalfa, NADP + -dependent ICDH is less active (100 and 4 nmol min\" 1 mg^1 protein for roots and leaves, respectively) (Shorrosh and Dixon, 1992). In this member of the legume family, ICDH appears to be most abundant in the nitrogen-fixing root nodules, its activity increasing to 150 nmol min\" 1 mg\" 1 protein.\n\nAs has been shown in \"Results,\" leaf maturation was accompanied by an increased level of icdh-1 mRNA (Fig. Fractions enriched in vascular tissue were obtained by collecting midribs and first-order veins. For northern blot analysis, 30 /j.g of total RNA were loaded onto each lane, and the blots were probed with a 32 P-labeled cDNA fragment encoding NADP + -dependent ICDH (icdh-1). Phosphorimaging analysis revealed that RNA expression in the vascular tissue was 200% (experiment 1, El) and 250% (experiment 2, E2) of the expression in total leaflets. www.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from\n\nCopyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Similarly, NADP + -dependent ICDH activity (on a protein basis) increased when leaves matured (Figs. 5b and 6). However, when leaf area was used as the reference, a decrease in ICDH activity was observed (Figs. 5b and 6). We found that, during the course of 7 weeks, the protein content decreased during leaf development from 5.7 to 2.3 g protein m~2. Therefore, the higher ICDH activity in fully developed leaves could be due to a higher stability of the enzyme as compared to other proteins, resulting in an increased specific activity of ICDH. Alternatively, the higher levels of icdh-1 mRNA in mature leaves could allow the synthesis of more ICDH protein. The apparent increase in icdh-1 mRNA level during potato leaf development appears to be more impressive than the increase in enzyme activity. With regard to this point, we are unable to rule out a shift in the ratio of mRNA to rRNA during leaf ontogeny. The question of whether de novo expression of a yet unidentified icdh gene that exhibits homology to the icdh-1 probe is responsible for the increase in northern blot signal intensity remains unanswered. The meaning of an elevated ICDH activity in fully mature leaves is not clear at present. One possibility is that NADP + -dependent ICDH is not only involved in amino acid biosynthesis (e.g. via the GS/ glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase cycle) but also in cycling, redistribution, and export of amino acids. To resolve this issue, future experiments will have to be used to analyze in detail the cellular aspects of the distribution of the enzyme within the potato leaf.\n\nSenescing leaves exhibit a decline in photosynthesis and a breakdown of nucleotides, chloroplast lipids, and proteins (mainly Rubisco), coupled with an increased export of amino acids (Pate, 1980;Bernhard and Matile, 1994). When detached potato leaves were kept in water under continuous darkness, senescence was induced. Under these conditions, the tissue exhibited a strong increase in the icdh-1 mRNA pool (Fig. 8), as well as an elevation in the activity of ICDH (Fig. 9a). Leaves lost about 26% of their total protein, and their total amino acids increased 3-fold during 24 h. In the light, however, protein and amino acid content remained constant (data not shown). An increased gene expression during senescence was demonstrated for malate synthase (Graham et al., 1992) and isocitrate lyase (De Bellis and Nishimura, 1991). The authors linked this phenomenon to the activation of the glyoxylate cycle, thought to metabolize products of nucleotide and chloroplast lipid breakdown. Furthermore, a cytosolic isoform of GS, which appears during senescence (Bernhard and Matile, 1994), has been assumed to be responsible for the re-assimilation of NH 3 , resulting from the catabolism of proteins and nucleic acids. It awaits further analysis whether NADP +dependent ICDH also participates in this process. Future experiments should be used to consider a possible reversal of the ICDH reaction for anaplerotic purposes when leaf starch reserves are depleted. This reversal could provide an alternative source of isocitrate at the expense of 2OG and of its amino acid precursors (Miiller et al., 1968). The resultant isocitrate could enter the citric acid cycle or fuel the senescence-induced glyoxylate cycle (Bernhard and Matile, 1994). ). 1, Cytosolic aconitase; 2, NADP'-dependent ICDH; 3, Cln oxoglutarate aminotransferase; 4, CS; 5, NO, reductase; 6, NO,-reductase; 7, Asp aminotransferase; 8, PEP carboxylase; 9, malate dehydrogenase; PRNC, photorespiratory nitrogen cycle; RC, respiration chain; RPPC, reductive pentose phosphate cycle; TCAC, tricarboxylic acid cycle. Strippled lines indicate transport processes; solid lines show enzyme reactions.

In the leaf, a redistribution to weakly transpiring growth centers occurs via the phloem. Whereas Gln and Asn may be reloaded directly into the phloem, other amino acids and NO,must be metabolically converted before being redistributed in the phloem (Pate, 1980;Atkins et al., 1983;Peoples and Gifford, 1990). This requirement may explain our finding of a predominant RNA expression and activity of NADP+-dependent ICDH in the vascular tissue of the potato leaf. High ICDH activities in leaf veins are consistent with the observation of a phloem-specific expression of a cytosolic GS from P. sativum (as analyzed with a promoter-GUS fusion gene in transgenic tobacco plants; Edwards et al., 1990).\n\nBecause xylem and phloem are in close proximity within the vascular strands throughout the plant, xylem-tophloem and xylem-to-xylem transfer of nitrogen compounds should be expected during transport (Pate, 1980;Peoples and Gifford, 1990). If NADPt-dependent ICDH takes part in the cycling of these nitrogen compounds during long-distance transport, tissue-specific clifferences in ICDH activities should be found in the potato stem. Preliminary experiments using enriched extracts of vascular tissue froin potato internodes have indeecl revealed elevated ICDH activities compared to total stem extracts (data not shown).\n\nIf NADP+-dependent ICDH is situated at a b ranchpoint between carbon and nitrogen metabolism (Cien et al., 1988), the variation of both the nitrogen and carbohydrate source should affect its activity. Experiments with detached leaves, kept in various feeding solutions. were performed to investigate whether essential parameters, such as light, SUC, or NO,-, have an impact on the RNA expression or on the enzyme activity of ICDH. A tight correlation between mRNA and ICDH activity must be expected if regulation occurs mainly at the transcriptional level.\n\nAt the RNA level, continuous darkness led to a decrease of ICDH during the initial 12 h of incubation (Fig. 8). Yet, icdk-2 transcript levels increase in leaves immed iately after transfer into the light when energy, reducing power, and carbon skeletons for nitrogen metabolism are provided through photosynthesis and, concomitantly, ph otorespiration leads to increased levels of NH,. The amount of icdk-2 mRNA was restored to the light level when dark-incubated detached leaves were supplied with NO,-and/or Suc for 6 to 12 h. Thus, NO,-or Suc can mimic the light effect. On the enzyme level, ICDH activities could be measured under a11 conditions, irrespective of the treatment of the leaf (Fig. 9). This observation might indicate a need to maintain a basic level of activity to satisfy cellular functions. However, the results obtained with detached leaves kept under various feeding conditions are difficult to interprctt since statistically significant changes in ICDH activity cc uld be seen in only few cases. Furthermore, activities could not always be reconciled with the RNA data (cf. Figs. 8 arid 9). In summary, the data reported here lead us ío speculate that regulation of ICDH may occur mainly via the net synthesis of new enzyme because of increasetl transcription and/or altered mRNA stability. The de\\ elopmental regulation of icdh-2 mRNA expression might be superimposed by a physiological control mechanism enabling the cell to respond to altered environmental condit ons. Future investigations will have to concentrate on the nature of the signals that trigger an increased expression 01' activity of ICDH under the conditions described and in general."
