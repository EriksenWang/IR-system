    "abstract": "Natural\ndisturbance by tree-falls has been monitored since 1973 on a 104-ha tract of old-growth mixed mesophytic forest at Lilley Cornett Woods in southeastern Kentucky.\nDuringthis time, 77 gaps have been recorded. Mean gap size is 374 m2, median size is2307 m2, add the range of gaps observed to date is from 74 m to 1235 m 2. Gap formation varies greatly by season and year.\nThe largest number of treefalls usually occurs in the summer from June through August. Tree-fall appears unrelated to regional weather patterns, but may be strongly influenced by local windstorms of high velocity and brief duration°Sudden death of American beech (Fagus .grandifolia) by overthrow or stem breakage is the most frequent cause of gaps, Although beech is also the most frequent tree with large boles in the forest, a greater proportion of gaps are formed than would be predicted from its density, probably because of its high incidence of hollow stems, and shallow root systems. More gaps are formed by large trees breaking off above the ground than by overturning.\nSlope positions and form do not appear to strongly influence tree-fall frequency.\nSeven estimates of canopy turnover time are given, based on two different methods,\nThe disturbance regime of scattered gaps formed in an uneven-aged forest suggests that the Woods provides an example of the \"shifting mosaic steady-state\" model of forest development.\n_ether or not the Woods is an area that provides all developmental stages of this model depends on definition of forest composition, continued long-term monitoring, and refinement of estimates of canopy turnover time.\nOur best estimate of canopy turnover time is 269 years, but this figure still represents a general estimate because different methods of calculation give different results.

    "full_text": "The mesic deciduous forests of the southern Appalachians have long been regarded as among the most stable types of ecosystems in North America (Braun 1950_ Wright 1974)o\n\nIn contrast to most coniferous forests, shrublands, grasslands_ and savannas, extensive, severe disturbances by fire, violent windstorms, etc_ probably were rare in the primeval forests of the southern Appalachians°Instead, disturbance occurred primarily through insect outbreaks_ fires that covered small areas_ and the occaional but perennial fall of large canopy trees which created scattered gaps in the otherwise closed canopy_ Recent studies in remnants of the pre-settlement southern Appalachian forests have shown that this natural disturbance regime, though perhaps less dramatic than that closed by extensive fires and violent windstorms_ nevertheless had a significant influence on forest composi-tion_ structure_ and dynamics°Several important canopy species, including tulip poplar (Liriodendron tuli_ifer__ a) and several species of oaks (Quercus s_p_o) are shade-intolerant and probably establish and persist in gaps of the mature forest°There_ they grow more rapidly than the shade-tolerant species and eventually occupy the canopy space vacated by the fallen tree (Buckner and McCracken !978_ Skeen, et alo 1980) o Other species can survive for many years suppressed in the understory, then grow rapidly to fill a canopy gap if one is formed overhead (Wallace and Dunn 1980;Lorimer 1981) o Even relatively shade-tolerant species appear to benefit from periodic small disturbances of this kind_ Lorimer (1980) documented distinct peaks in the age-class distributions of hemlock (Ts__a canadensis) and beech (Fa_a_ _randifolia) in a virgin forest of western North Carolina, and attributed these peaks to increased recruitment following localized disturbance°Similarly_ Hough and Forbes (1943) found apparent disturbance related peaks in the age-class distribution of white ash (Fraxinus americana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), sweet birch (Betula lenta), yellow birch (Bo lutea), red maple (Acer rubrum), beech and hemlock in a virgin forest of northwestern Pennsylvania°In studies of the species replacement patterns in tree-fall gaps in several remnant forests of the southern Appalachians, Barden (1979Barden ( , 1980) ) and Runkle (1979Runkle ( , 1981) ) concluded that regeneration in small gaps is sufficient to perpetuate the current composition of a species-rich forest canopy_\n\nDespite the studies cited above, the tree-fall gap dynamics of oldgrowth forests on the Appalachian Plateau have not been examined closely. Southeastern Kentucky is located on this dissected plateau and lies in the geographic center of the Mixed Mesophytic Forest Association as defined by Braun (1950) o The largest known remnant of pre-settlement forest in eastern Kentucky is the 104-ha tract at Lilley Cornett Woods (LCW) in Letcher County, Kentucky°Documentation of canopy-opening tree-falls began in LCW in 1973 with information recorded about the size and position of the gaps formed°In this paper, results to date are presented. Our objectives are to (i) determine the frequency distribution of gap size;\n\n(2) examine the occurrence of significant tree-falls in relation to year and season, species and condition of the trees making gaps (\"gap-makers\"), and slope position and form; and (3) estimate the canopy turnover time, i._eo, the number of years necessary for an area equal to the entire area of LCW to be disturbed by gaps°3 STaY AREA Lilley Cornett Woods is located in the rugged eastern area of the Cumberland Plateau (sensu Braun 1950), ca. 30 km southeast of Hazard_ Kentucky°Elevation ranges from 315 to 588 mo Mean annual precipitation is 133 cm, and mean annual temperature is 13 °Co Nine forest community types have been identified_ based on canopy composition (Martin 1975) o These range from chestnut oak (_uercus _)-dominated communities on the most xeric sites (ridge crests) to cove communities with sugar maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia het_a), and tulip poplar on the most mesic (cove) sites.\n\nBeech is common on mesic sites_ and is at least present on all but the driest sites.\n\nNo major fires or timber cutting are known to have occurred in the 104-ha of old-growth forests°A few dead chestnut (Castanea dentata) trees were removed early in this century and livestock once roamed the area, but otherwise human disturbance has been minimal.\n\nMartin (1975) provides a detailed discussion of forest communities_ geology, soils and physical environment of Lilley Cornett Woods.\n\nSince i973, we have recorded the fall of large trees in the oldgrowth forest°However_ through January, 1981, regular_ intensive searches were not made, and some tree-falls probably were overlooked during this time_\n\nThe irregular 1973-1980 searches do not appear detrimental to the data base_ an intensive search in February, 1981, turned up only six treefalls from the previous three years that had not been recorded°Since February, 1981, an intensive search has been made throughout all parts of the old-growth forest during the first ten days of each month to document the gaps formed during the preceding month°G aps are defined as openings in the forest canopy that originate from the fall of a canopy tree.\n\nIn each gap, the following data are recorded:\n\nspecies, dbh and soundness of fallen tree, mechanism of gap formation (stem overturned or broken off), canopy condition before the tree-fall (closed canopy or edge of another gap), slope position (lower, middle, upper)_ slope form (convex or concave slopes_ termed \"lead 'f or \"draw _' respectively in this paper)_ slope aspect (east, northeast, etc_), slope steepness (% class), and gap dimensions.\n\nGaps are treated as ellipses within which the longest and shortest axes are measured.\n\nThe perimeter of the gap is defined by the presence of live canopy branches overhead.\n\nThis definition of gap perimeter differs from that used by other investigators who measure from the boles of surrounding canopy trees.\n\nTurnover Time\n\nTurnover time was calculated using data from four different segments of the eight-year period to investigate changes in the rate of tree fall.\n\nIn each case the number of hectares disturbed during this time interval of interest was divided by the number of years to calculate average total gap area formed per year.\n\nThis number was then divided into total area of oldgrowth forest (104 ha) to obtain turnovertime in years.\n\nThe second method for estimating turnover time involved walking nine transects parallel to the slope contour and recording the number of paces taken in gaps and under closed canopy.\n\nThis sampling was done in March, 1981, in a 40-ha portion of LCW known locally as Big Everidge Hollowo The nine parallel transects were ca. 80 m apart and a total of 8.5 km was walked_ The age of each gap encountered was estimated on the basis of the species and state of decomposition of the fallen tree. From these data, the percent of the area in the old-growth forest occupied by gaps of various ages (0-5 years, 0-i0 years, 0-20 years) was calculated with turnover time then estimated by solving the proportional equation:\n\n%__of forestin gaps 100% of forestin gaps b years = x\n\nThe constant b was 5, I0, or 20 depending on which gap age class was being treated o The unknown term x is the turnover time in years.\n\nNomenclatureherein follows Fernald (1950).\n\nBased on data from 77 gaps formed since 1973, the majority of gaps fall into size classes ranging from 100-600 m 2 (Figure i). Gap si_e ranged from 74 m2 to 1235 m , with a mean of 374 m 2 and a median of 307 m _. Four additional tree-fall events were recorded in which large trees surrounding a gap fell into the gap and enlarged it, though the area of new disturbance was considerably less than if the fallen trees had created individual gaps. In these cases, we arbitrarily assumed that the gap size was increased by 20 m 2 and used this figure in calculations of total seasonal disturbance, but these trees were excluded in calculations of mean gap size and in Figure I.\n\nTen of the 77 measured gaps were formed by two or three trees falling simultaneously. One would expect these events to produce the largest gaps, but as Figure i illustrates, this was not always the case. Gap size is, in part, a function of crown dimensions, and these vary considerably among individual trees.\n\nFor example, two trees with small crowns may form a gap no larger than that formed by a single tree with a large crown. It may also be expected that the largest fallen trees are associated with the largest gaps, but there is not a significant relationship (p < 0.i) between dbh of a fallentree and gap size.\n\nIt would be useful to compare mean gap size in LCW with estimates from other temperate deciduous forests, but comparative data are largely unavailable.\n\nThe only directly comparable estimate that canbe cited is that of Williamson (1975) who measured ten gaps formed by single tree-falls in an oSd-growth beech-maple forest in Indiana and found a mean gap size of I01 m z and a median size of 75 m 2. Other mean gap size estimates come from studies in broad-leaf tropical forests, where tree-fall gaps are also a major form of natural disturbance. Brokaw (1980Brokaw ( , 1982aBrokaw ( , 1982b) measured 43 gaps in an old-growth forest in Panama and obtained a mean gap size of 87 m2, a median of 57 m2, and a range of 26-342 m2. By contrast, Richards and Williamson (1975) determined a mean gap size of 810 m 2 and a median of 920 m2 in a mature forest in Costa Rica, based on five gaps, two of which were formed by the simultaneous fall of two trees. distribution of gap sizes measured in LCW from June, 1973 through February, 1982. Numbers at the tops of bars = total number of individual gaps in each s!ze class°\n\nSample sizes in the Indiana and Costa Rica studies are fairly small, and Brokaw included gaps created by broken branches and falling tangles of vines, which probably form smaller gaps than do entire trees; these are not included in our study°Obviously, the results from these studies are not directly comparable to data from this study, so more research is necessa_ before we can describe any general patterns in gap size among broad-leaf forests.\n\nThe rate of tree-fall and magnitude of disturbance vary greatly by season and by year (Figure 2). The sizes of one gap formed in spring, 1978, of two in summer, 1978, and one in slimmer, 1980, were inadvertently not measured_ the median size determined from the 77 other gaps was assigned for this analysis°In 1975, there were at least 24 major tree-falls, whereas in 1976 and 1979 there apparently were none.\n\nDuring the years when treefalls were observed, the largest number consistently occurred during the summer months_ mostly in June.\n\nThe rate of tree-fall appears to have increased substantially in the last two years. Although this increase may be an artifact of more intensive search for tree-falls that began at about the same time_ it more likely reflects an actual change in the rate of gap formation rate°Accelerated tree-fall has been observed along the trails, where tree-falls have been thoroughly documented since 1973, and in less-visited portions of LCW where some earlier tree-falls may have been missedo\n\nIn an attempt to identify a possible cause for tree-fall patterns, tree-fall data were compared to several precipitation variables and wind movement data obtained from the nearest national weather stations in Cumberland and Buckhorn Lake, Kentucky, 13 km and 48 km from LCW, respectively (Figure 3). Although some patterns were present in the climatic data, they appear generally unrelated to the number of tree-falls at LCW.\n\nIn contrast, Brokaw (1980, 1982s_ 1982b) found that tree-falls per month were significantly correlated with both monthly rainfall and mean monthly % soil moisture in a mature forest in Panama.\n\nHe concluded that the combination of the weight of the water on leaves and stems, the loosening of roots in saturated soils_ and occasional gusty winds were sufficient to bring down large trees_ especially those weakened by insect and fungal damage. We suggest that the major climatic factor influencing the frequency of treefalls in LCW is the occurrence of local winds of high velocity and short duration--wind information that is not detected at regional weather stations. These winds tend to create gaps during the early summer months when trees are fully leafed out, soils are at or near saturation, and foliage may be heavy with recent rain.\n\nA violent storm on 4 July, 1975, lasted less than an hour but knocked down at least 16 large trees in LCW. This storm created as many or more gaps as would normally be formed and recorded during an entire year of single tree-falls.\n\nAnother brief, violent storm in February, 1981, toppled i0 trees.\n\nThe proportion of gaps formed by the fallen trees is distributed among the dominant trees recognized at LCW (Martin 1975).\n\nNearly half of all fallen trees were beech (Figure 4). This is to be expected since beech is also the most frequently occurring large tree and it has the highest relative density values.\n\nThe second most common fallen tree is white oak (Quercus alba) and it is also the second in relative density values in the forest. Although sample sizes for the other species are low, gap formation appears\n\n17 7000 m [_ GAPS FORMED BY 2 OR 3 TREES FALLING SIMULTANEOUSLY 6000 4 _/_ GAPS FORMED BY A SINGLE TREE oo < (5 5000 W= winter --J \" _/_ V = spring < u. _/, S : summer i _/, 10 \"' F: fall I.Ll ec 4000 r/_ 10 a w _ 4 Z) 3000 I---.4 121 t_ 2000 5 < 4 LU 3 _) 1000 .;.:, _ 5 _ 2 o _ o o o o o o 2.

'Other Gap-Makers' includes six species, each of which has fallen once (1o0%) each): tulip poplar_ black oak (_uercus velutina), basswood, Virginia pine (Pinus Vir_niana), shortieaf pine (Po echinata)\n\nand white ash (Fraxinus americana). 'Other Species' includes 14 upland species _ 35 c--m dbh which\n\nhave not yet fallen.\n\nroughly proportional to density, One exception is chestnut oak, which apparently is windfirm despite its abundance on upper slopes and ridgetops. The less abundant co-dominant tree on these sites, scarlet oak (_uercus coccin2a) _ has fallen 4°5 times more often than chestnut oak in the last eight year's°B eech falls more frequently than would be estimated by its relative density value°The high frequency of hollow stems (60%) among !ar_e beech probably accounts for its high proportion of fallen trees°Fallen trees of all other species have mainly sound stems (over 80% sound) which presumably are less likely to break off or overturn in a strong wind. More gaps are formed by trees breaking off above the ground (breakage) than by overturning (Figure 5)°Beech and scarlet oak appear especially susceptible to breakage. The high incidence in beech probably is related to hollow boles, \"but in scarlet oak they are sound; the fallen scarlet oak recorded are all sound°White oak and northern red oak (Quercus rubra) also have relatively sound stems_ but a high incidence of breakage. This relationship is additional evidence that strong, local winds are an important cause of tree-fall in LCWo If high wind velocities were the major causal factor in gap formation, one would expect most gaps on upper slopes_ ridgetops and on exposed leads. Gaps are indeed more frequent on leads, but more tree-falls occur on middle slopes than on upper or lower slopes (Figure 6)°This may simply be due to the somewhat random localizations of brief, violent winds°The storm of 4 July, 1975_ had more impact on the canopy at middle slopes than at other slope positions_ whereas the storm in February_ 1981, affected mainly the upper slope°Since gap formation can occur at any slope position and gaps are not uncommon in draws_ the data are inconclusive regarding topography as a major controlling factor in the frequency of gap formation. Forest Dynamics Because shade-intolerant tree species reproduce primarily in gaps, and other woody and herbaceous species may be largely restricted to gaps, an estimate of the turnover time of the forest canopy is important for understanding the long-term dynamics and composition of this mature forest. Turnover time is the number of years necessary for an area equal to the total old-gro_th forest in LCW (104 ha) to be disturbed by tree-fall gaps. The turnover time may roughly correspond to the average interval between successive gaps on any particular 1 m 2 patch, although certain patches undoubtedly are subjected to longer and shorter intervals. Seven different estimates of canopy turnover time have been calculated based on two different methods (Figure 7; see Methods). The four estimates on the left half of the figure (7a through 7d) are from the tree-falls observed and recorded during the eight-year study. Turnover time based on tree-falls observed during the first half of our study (spring 1974 through winter 1978) is 307 years_ 53 years longer than the turnover time calculated from the second half of the study (spring 1978 through winter 1982) o This difference reflects the accelerated rate of tree-fall in recent years.

However, confidence in estimates of turnover times must be improved before any general patterns can be described with confidence.\n\nA growing body of evidence indicates that frequent and extensive disturbances by fire or wind had a profound influence on the structure and .dynamics of pre-settlement forests in many parts of North America, including the western mountains (Cooper 1960_ Habeck and Mutch 1973_ Loope and Gruell 1973;Kilgore and Taylor 1979), the Great Lakes region (Frissell 1973;Heinselmann 1973), parts of New England (Stephens 1955;1956;Henry and Swan 1974), and other areas.\n\nFire and violent winds are viewed as exogenous or external natural disturbances, since they originate outside of the normal processes of plant growth and succession9 as opposed to endogenous or internal disturbances such as the fall of large, old trees (Bormann andLikens 1979a, 1979b).\n\nLoucks (1970) hypothesized that recurrent fires continually interrupted the normal succession in pre-settlement forests of Wisconsin and returned the ecosystem to an earlier developmental stage. Because of such exogenous disturbances, many forest ecosystems probably never reached a stable or climax condition°B orfaann and Likens (i979a_ 1979b) have argued that_ despite the findings cited above_ some forested areas of North America probably were subjected to relatively infrequent exogenous disturbances°In these areas endogenous disturbances of reduced magnitude and effect predominated°Thus, it would be possible for a dynamic steady-state condition to develop_ and forests would consist of a mosaic of patches in in various stages of development following endogenous disturbance°The location of patches in any particular developmental stage changes over time time as new tree-falls occur and normal successional processes take place, but the proportion of the total forest area occupied by each developmental stage remains relatively constant over time°Bormann and Likens refer to such a system as a _shifting mosaic steady-state_o They further propose that the humid_ temperate mountains of the northeastern United States are centers where the probability of achieving steady-state Conditions is highest_ _hile in almost every direction away from these centers the influence of exogenous disturbances increases and the probability of a dynamic steady-state progressively decreases°W e hypothesize that the mixed mesophytic forests of the southern Appalachians were similar centers of steady-state dynamics prior to European settlement°These forests_ especially those in sheltered coves and gorges_ are rarely affected by hurricanes or tornadoes (Wright 1974), and lightning-caused fires_ though they do occur_ are relatively infrequent and usually of small size and low intensity in this region (Barden andWoods 1974_ Harmon 1982) o In so:me areas_ Indian-caused fires and treecutting were very significant (Cridlebaugh 1982)_ but it is likely that these effects were localized°Indian populations in the vicinity of LCW probably never were high, since game ani._mls were less concentrated than on open lands.\n\nTherefore, we also hypothesize that LCW represents a remnant of a formerly extensive shifting mosaic steady-state similar to that proposed by Bormann and Likens for the mo_ntains of New England. These data from LC_$ document the frequency and intensity of endogenous disturbances by tree-falls in the primeval mixed mesophytic forest of eastern Kentucky°It can be argued that some tree-falls are really of exogenous origin, namely the brief_ violent and localized windstorms such as the one of 4 July 1975.\n\nSuch storms appear to affect a relatively small portion of LCW, and their influence is probably much less than the influence of exogenous disturbances (_o_o_ fire) in other ecosystems. There is an exogenous element in the disturbance regime of LCW, but we think that endogenous disturbances predominate°I f pre-settlement mixed mesophytic forest in eastern Kentucky was a shifting mosaic steady-state system_ sensu Bormann andLikens (1979a, 1979b), an important consideration here is whether the 104-ha of old-growth forest preserved in LCW constitute a large enough remnant to represent the entire pre-settlement mosaic_ Shugart and West (1981) have quantified the general relationship between the average gap size created by disturbances and the minimum size of a landscape area that can contain such gaps and still remain in a steady-state or equilibrium condition.\n\nIn a landscape where gap sizes are on the order of 102 to 103 m 2 (as in LCW; see Figure I), Shugart and West suggest that a minimum total area of 104 to 105 m 2 must be preserved to retain a representative sample of all developmental stages.\n\nLCW contains 106 m 2 of old-growth forest (104 ha x 104 m2/ha)_ so by these criteria LCW as a whole probably retains the dynamic mosaic of forest developmental stages that characterized the larger region prior to European settlement°However_ another factor to consider is that nine different community types are found in LCW (Martin 1975), While the average size of individual disturbances remains the same_ the total area preserved is less than the minimum 105 m 2 for co_nunities such as t'he mesic cove community dominated by sugar maple, basswood_ and tulip poplar or the hemlock community of lower slopes.\n\nFor these specific co mmunities_ LCW at any one time probably contains only a portion of the developmental stages that could occur following endogenous disturbances_ thus the potential landscape mosaic is incomplete.\n\nThe recent increase in rate of tree-fall in LCW may be related to the mosaic pattern_ Continued monitoring is necessary to determine whether this increase in tree-fall rate is only a short-lived expression of inherent variability which will be followed by a presumably more normal reduced rate_ or whether it represents the beginning of a significant change in the dynamics of the forest.\n\nIf LCW does not contain a full spectrum of developmental stages_ then it may be that a large portion of the forest is undergoing development somewhat sync'hronously_ perhaps following a major disturbance two or more centuries ago, Possibly much of the forest is now entering a transitional phase precedin_ the true steadystate (Bormann andLikens 1979a, 1979b) in which many large_ even-aged trees that became established in the canopy at about the same time reach their maximum life spans and succumb to wind and other local stresses. Continuing documentation of monthly tree-falls in LCW_ plus additional research to reconstruct past disturbance events and better describe the patterns of forest development following disturbance may provide answers to 'these and other questions about the long-term dynamics of the presettlement mixed mesophytic forest in eastern Kentucky°A\n\nWe thank Mr, Michael Brotzge_ Superintendent_ and Mr. Robert Watts 9 Assistant Superintendent of LCW_ for locating and documenting tree-falls and collecting most of the field data on individual gaps.\n\nWithout their diligent and energetic efforts and their continued commitment to this pro-ject_ this paper and ongoing gap research would not be possible°L\n\nITERATURE CITED Barden_ L°S°1979o Tree replacement in small canopy gaps of a Tsu_ canadensis forest in the southern Appalachians°Oecologia 44: 141-142.
