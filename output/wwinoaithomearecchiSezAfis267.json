We present experimental results, and compare them with the predictions of a linear stability analysis of the equations governing the system. Nonlocality is introduced in the system via a lateral transport of a length ∆x of the feedback signal. The value of the transport length plays a key role in determining the symmetry of the selected pattern in systems with both focusing and defocusing nonlinearity. In the defocusing case, the spatial wavelength of the pattern is also affected by the value of the transport length.",
    "full_text": "Pattern formation in nonlinear optical systems driven out of thermodynamical equilibrium has been widely discussed and demonstrated both in active and in passive optical devices [1]. The mechanism leading to pattern forming instabilities in optics is not unique. Therefore different physical agents, e.g. diffraction, diffusion, material nonlinearities, boundary conditions, determine the scale and the symmetry of the pattern occurring in different systems.\n\nHere we report experimental and theoretical results about the role played by some nonlocal interactions [2,3], in affecting the pattern formation in a system formed by a Liquid Crystal Light Valve (LCLV) inserted in an optical feedback loop [4]. In the absence of nonlocality this system is equivalent to a Kerr slice with optical feedback [5]. The pattern forming instability arises in this case from the interplay of diffraction, diffusion and material nonlinearity.\n\nIn the case of a system with large Fresnel number, the symmetry of the selected pattern depends on the nonlinearity [6], while its typical scale is determined by diffraction and diffusion. If the diffractive scale √ λL, where λ is the optical wavelength and L is the free propagation distance, is much larger than the diffusive scale l d , then the role of diffusion in determining the selected scale is negligible, and the pattern wavenumber is of the order of the diffractive scale. The most typical result for such a system is the formation of hexagons [6][7][8], due to the presence of quadratic nonlinearities, at a wavelength Λ = √ 2λl or Λ = 2λl/3, for a Kerr medium with focusing or defocusing nonlinearity respectively.\n\nNonlocal interactions can be introduced in systems of the kind considered here e.g. via a rotation [9][10][11] or a translation [12][13][14][15] of the feedback signal. In all the cases, the presence of nonlocalities strongly affect the scenario of pattern formation. In the following we report some of the most significant results obtained in the case in which the nonlocality is introduced via a lateral displacement ∆x of the feedback signal.\n\nThe experimental setup shown in Fig. 1 consists of a liquid crystal light valve (LCLV) with diffractive feedback. The LCLV is a Kerr device operating in reflection. It induces on the wave reflected by its front face a phase distribution proportional to the intensity distribution of the light impinging on its rear face. The nonlinearity of the LCLV is of defocusing type.\n\nIn the present problem, however, a sign change of the propagation distance L is fully equivalent to a sign change of the nonlinearity [14]. The sign change of L is easily implemented via a proper choice of lenses inserted in the feedback loop. In these conditions, the nonlinearity of the overall system (LCLV+propagation) can be easily switched from defocusing to focusing.\n\nIn a first set of measurements [3], we keep fixed the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the LCLV at V 0 = 10 V r.m.s. and ν = 1.5 KHz respectively, and the propagation distance L = -38 cm (in the following we will indicate by L the modulus of the propagation length, which is actually negative). The overall nonlinearity of the system is therefore of focusing type. The input intensity is provided by an Ar + laser operating at λ = 514 nm.\n\nWe set the input intensity at I 0 = 23 µW /cm 2 , and gradually increase the value of ∆x. The intensity patterns observed in these conditions are reported in Fig. 2 together with the far field patterns corresponding to the Fourier spectra.\n\nFor ∆x close to 0, an hexagonal pattern is observed. The hexagons here are not oriented along some privileged direction, across the whole wavefront. Rather, domains with hexagons oriented along all the possible directions fill the plane, as evidenced by the fact that the Fourier spectrum (Fig. 2a ) is not made by a single hexagonal set of spots, but by many hexagonal sets angularly separated and filling almost uniformely a ring of constant radius.\n\nIn the range 70 µm< ∆x < 510 µm, a horizontal roll pattern is dominating. This structure is replaced by a square pattern for a range of ∆x between 520 µm and 560 µm. A further increase of ∆x results in the appearence of a very regular tiling of the plane with hexagons (600 µm< ∆x < 770 µm). At variance with the hexagons observed for ∆x = 0, these ones are oriented  along a preferred direction, as shown by the defined spots in the Fourier space. The absence of defects in the texture is nearly total. n general, these hexagons are nonequilateral, the ratio between their sides depending on the values of ∆x. For very large values of ∆x (∆x > 780 µm), the hexagonal pattern breaks into domains (Fig. 2f,f ) each one filled by a different combination of the excited modes.\n\nIn a second set of measurements [2], we fixed the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the LCLV to V 0 = 12.5 V r.m.s., ν = 4 kHz, and the free propagation length to L = 26 cm. Since the propagation length is positive, the nonlinearity of the overall system is of defocusing type.\n\nFigure 3 shows the sequence of patterns in the near field (above) and in the far field (spatial Fourier transform of the near field ) (below) observed at a fixed value of input intensity I 0 = 72 µW /cm 2 for increasing ∆x .\n\nAt ∆x = 0 (Fig. 3a) stationary hexagons are observed. For 20 µm < ∆x < 170 µm (Fig. 3b), hexagons loose stability and are substituted by stationary rolls with length scale independent of ∆x and oriented along ∆x. At ∆x = 180 µm (Fig. 3c) a cross-roll pattern formed by the coexistence of horizontal and vertical rolls emerges. Notice that horizontal and vertical rolls have different wavelengths. Vertical rolls prevail over horizontal ones for 200 µm < ∆x < 260 µm (Fig. 3d), and display a pitch that increases for increasing ∆x. These rolls drift in time in the ∆x direction with a velocity which is a decreasing function of ∆x. For ∆x 270 µm transverse distorsions of vertical rolls begin to form, ending up with zig-zag generation (Fig. 3e).\n\nThere are appearent differences between the focusing and defocusing case with respect both to the selected pattern scale (only one scale in the focusing case, two scales in the defocusing case) and symmetry (vertical rolls exist only in the the defocusing case; hexagons for ∆x ≠ 0 are observed only in the focusing case). We discuss the origin of these features in the next sections.\n\nThe equation governing the evolution of the optical phase ϕ(r, t) is [3,5]:\n\n(\n\nWhere I 0 is the input intensity, l d and τ are respectively the diffusion length and the local relaxation time of the phase, L is the free propagation length, k 0 is the optical wavenumber, α is the Kerr coefficient (α > 0 for focusing nonlinearity; α < 0 for defocusing nonlinearity) and T x is a translation operator along the x direction defined by:\n\nInformation on the observed scenario can be gained by linear stability analysis of (1), describing the spatiotemporal evolution of ϕ(r, t). Temporal and spatial Fourier transformation of Eq.\n\n(1) provides relations for the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalue σ q + iω q associated with the perturbations at wavevector q:\n\n)cos(q∆xcosφ)\n\n(3)\n\n)sin(q∆xcosφ) (4) where k 0 ≡ 2π/λ is the optical wavenumber, q is the modulus of q, and φ is the angle between q and ∆x. The diffractive term sin(q 2 L/2k 0 ) accounts for the free propagation within the optical feedback loop.\n\nLet us consider first the case of L > 0, in which the overall nonlinearity of the system is focusing. The fundamental set of modes that maximizes the real part of the eigenvalue are expected to first destabilize at threshold. They are:\n\nφ = 0, π, q = q(∆x), (vertical rolls) ( 6)\n\nIn writing the expressions for the unstable wavenumbers in the cases of horizontal and oblique rolls we have assumed that diffraction is dominating over diffusion in determining the length scale of the patterns [6]. This is justified by the fact that the diffusion length of the LCLV is l d 40 µm, so that l d 2 k 0 /L 0.1. Notice that in this case both the horizontal and the oblique roll modes lie on the band q πk 0 /L. As a consequence, both modes have the same threshold intensity I th , hence they can coexist close to threshold, giving rise to the hexagonal pattern observed for ∆x ≠ 0. The threshold of the vertical roll mode is larger than I th except for a single value of ∆x (∆x 520 µm); this explains why vertical rolls are not observed in the focusing case.\n\nSince the eigenvalue associated with the vertical roll mode has a nonzero imaginary part, the square pattern observed around ∆x = 520 µm is drifting with a velocity of the order of 100 µm/sec. All the other patterns observed are stationary in time, since they arise from bifurcations of modes having zero imaginary part. This is at variance with the situation occurring in onedimensional systems [12,15], in which drifting patterns are generic.\n\nFigure 4 presents the theoretical threshold curves for the solutions ( 5)-( 7), together with the experimentally measured values of the threshold intensities. The LCLV parameters are l d = Fig. 4. Experimental and theoretical thresholds for pattern formation in the focusing case (from Ref. [3] with permission). The long (short) dashed line is the threshold calculated for vertical (horizontal) rolls, the solid line is the theoretical threshold for both horizontal and oblique rolls. The full circles represent the experimental measurements with the corresponding error bars. The Kerr coefficient used in the calculation is α = 0.072 cm 2 /µW . 40 µm, α = 0.072 cm 2 /µW . The bifurcation of the hexagons at ∆x = 0 is subcritical, and it requires to consider nonlinear cooperative terms between modes [6].\n\nIf we repeat the linear stability analysis for the case of defocusing nonlinearity, we obtain as the most unstable modes:\n\nφ = 0, π, q = q(∆x), (vertical rolls) ( 9)\n\nWith respect to the analogous expression for the focusing case [16], we notice two main differences. First, the oblique roll solution exists now for\n\nSecond, the horizontal and the oblique roll modes lie on different bands.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we report the marginal stability curves (λ q = 0) in the (∆x, I 0 ) plane for the solutions (8)- (10), together with the experimental instability thresholds. The theoretical curves are in fair agreement with the experimental values for a choice of the LCLV parameters l d = 40 µm, α = -0.0134 cm 2 /µW . As in the focusing case, the only quantitative discrepancy between theory and experiments is observed for ∆x 0, since for ∆x = 0 the solution at threshold is the hexagonal pattern that cannot be accounted for by the linear stability analysis.\n\nThis explains the discrepancy between the measured hexagon thresholds and the ones predicted by LSA. For all the other observed patterns, the agreement between theory and experiment is good.\n\nWe have presented an experimental and theoretical investigation on the role of transport in determining the pattern formation and selection mechanisms in a nonlinear optical system. The basic mechanism whereby transport comes into play is a variation of the spatial phase relation between the phase field ϕ(r) and the intensity field I f b (r) fed back to ϕ(r). Though in our system transport is introduced by purpose, we argue that this conclusion has some validity also for physical system in which transport is an intrinsic phenomenon. In hydrodynamical systems subject to Rayleigh-Benard convection, for example, it is well known that a series of transition between different patterns (rolls, cross rolls, zig-zags) occur when increasing the pump parameter [16].\n\nThe fact that these hydrodynamical instabilities occur for an increasing pump parameter, represents a relevant difference with our experiment, in which the pattern transitions are observed at fixed pump intensity, varying the transport length ∆x. We suggest however that some link between the two situations may exist. On one side, as explicitely discussed in the previous secitions, the instability threshold for pattern formation depends on ∆x, and hence modification of ∆x at fixed pump intensity results in a modification of the above threshold. On the other side, some hydrodynamical transport lengths can depend on the level of excitation of the system [17]. Following these considerations, we believe that the system here studied belongs to a broader class of physical systems in which nonlocal interactions have a relevant role."
