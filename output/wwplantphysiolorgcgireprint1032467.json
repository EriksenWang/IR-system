    "full_text": "Arabidopsis thaliana 1-DNA transformants were screened for mutations affecting seed fatty acid composition. A mutant line was found with reduced levels of linolenic acid (18:3) due to a 1-DNA insertion. Cenomic DNA flanking the 1-DNA insertion was used to obtain an Arabidopsis cDNA that encodes a polypeptide identified as a microsomal 0-3 fatty acid desaturase by its complementation of the mutation. Analysis of lipid content in transgenic tissues demonstrated that this enzyme is limiting for 1 8 3 production in Arabidopsis seeds and carrot hairy roots. This cDNA was used to isolate a related Arabidopsis cDNA, whose mRNA is accumulated to a much higher leve1 in leaf tissue relative to root tissue. This related cDNA encodes a protein that is a homolog of the micro-soma1 desaturase but has an N-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide, and its gene maps to a position consistent with that of the Arabidopsis fad D locus, which controls plastid w-3 desaturation. These Arabidopsis cDNAs were used as hybridization probes to isolate cDNAs encoding homologous proteins from developing seeds of soybean and rapeseed. lhe high degree of sequence similarity between these sequences suggests that the w -3 desaturases use a common enzyme mechanism.\n\nThe w-6 and w-3 fatty acid desaturases introduce the second and the third double bonds, respectively, in the biosynthesis of 1 8 2 and 18:3 fatty acids, which are important constituents of plant membranes. (The w-3 and w-6 designations refer to positions of the double bond from the methyl end of fatty acids.) They are also commercially important because the oxidative stability and nutritional value of seed oils is affected by the levels of these fatty acids. In leaf tissue, there are two distinct pathways for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, one located in the microsomes and the other located in the plastid membranes. In nongreen tissues and developing seeds, the microsomal pathway predominates. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the microsomal w-6 and w-3 fatty acid desaturations are controlled by the fad 2 and fud 3 loci, respectively (Lem-ieux et al., 1990), and the plastid w-6 and w-3 fatty acid desaturations are controlled by the fad C and fad D loci, respectively (Browse and Somerville, 1991). It has been postulated that these loci correspond to structural genes for the desaturase enzymes, which have been recalcitrant to purification and study. Indeed, a cDNA encoding a Brassica napus microsomal w-3 desaturase was recently cloned by homology to a fragment of Arabidopsis genomic DNA isolated by mapbased cloning of the fud 3 locus (Arondel et al., 1992).\n\nGenetic approaches for cloning plant genes encoding biochemically intractable products, such as membrane-associated desaturases, are becoming increasingly more refined and powerful, especially in studies that depend on the small, well-characterized genome of A. thaliana. In addition to mapbased cloning, these methods include transposon tagging (Balcells et al., 1991) and T-DNA tagging (Feldmann, 1991;Walden et al., 1991). The T-DNA tagging method, in which insertion of the T-DNA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens into a gene of interest via transformation provides both the mutant phenotype and the means with which to clone the mutant allele, has been most successful to date.\n\nWe report here the isolation of the Arabidopsis microsomal 0-3 fatty acid desaturase gene by T-DNA tagging and the subsequent use of its cognate cDNA to manipulate the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in transgenic plant tissues as well as to isolate cDNAs from Arabidopsis, soybean, and rapeseed that encode homologs of the microsomal w-3 desaturase, including putative plastid w-3 desaturases.\n\nAbout 100 TB seeds (2 mg) of each of 6000 members of a population of T-DNA transformed lines of Arabidopsis thalianu (ecotype Wassilewskija) (Feldmann and Marks, 1987)  Plant Physiol. Vol. 103, 1993 were pooled and the fatty acid content of each of the 6000 pooled samples was determined (Browse et al., 1986).\n\nUnless otherwise noted, nucleic acid hybridizations, including Southern blots, were carried out in 6X SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 1OX Denhardt's solution, and 100 pg/mL of denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65OC overnight. They were then washed twice for 10 min in 2 X SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and then for 10 min in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65OC. 32P-labeled DNA probes for a11 hybridizations in this work were prepared by the random primer labeling method (Feinberg and Volgestein, 1983).\n\nLibraries of genomic DNA from wild-type A. thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) and mutant line 3707 (see \"Results\") were made by cloning size-fractionated Sau3A partia1 fragments into BamHI-digested X Cem-1 1 phage DNA (Promega). The Arabidopsis cDNA library was made to poly(A)+ RNA isolated from hypocotyls of 3-d-old etiolated wild-type A. thaliana seedlings (ecotype Columbia) (Kieber et al., 1993). The soybean (Glycine max) cDNA library was made to poly(A)' RNA isolated from developing soybean seeds (Grimes et al., 1992).\n\nThe rapeseed (Brassica napus) cDNA library used was made as follows: poly(A)' RNA was obtained by oligo(dT) cellulose affinity chromatography of polysomal RNA isolated from developing rapeseed seeds 20 to 21 d after pollination by the procedure of Kamalay and Goldberg (1980). Four micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA were reverse transcribed and used to construct a cDNA library in X phage (Uni-ZAP XR vector) using the protocol described in the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene).\n\nThe left T-DNA-plant DNA junction fragments were isolated from SalIor BamHI-digested genomic DNA from mutant line 3707 (see \"Results\") by the method of plasmid rescue (Behringer and Medford, 1992). The right T-DNAplant DNA junction fragment was isolated by screening a line 3707 genomic DNA library with a 32P-labeled 0.6-kb PCR product derived from wild-type Arabidopsis DNA at a region between the site of T-DNA insertion and the region hybridizing to CF3 cDNA (see \"Results\") (Fig. 1). Southern analysis of phage DNA from a pure, positively hybridizing plaque showed that a 4-kb EcoRI fragment hybri_dized to the PCR probe. This right junction EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK I1 vector (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences of the double-stranded plasmids containing the junction fragments were determined using the Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical).\n\nThe wild-type Arabidopsis genomic DNA library was screened with a 32P-labeled 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment from the left junction fragment (see \"Results\"). Filters were hybridized overnight at 65OC in 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 M IVaPi (NaH2P04 a,nd Na2HP04), pH 7.2, 10 mM EDTA, and! 7% (w/v) SDS and rinsed twice with 0.1X SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 65OC for 30 min each. Seven positively hybridizing plaques were purified. Southern analysis of phage DNA from several pure plaques showed that a 5.2-kb HindIII fragment hybridized to the probe. This fragment was isolated and subcloned in pBluescript SK I1 vector.\n\nThe Arabidopsis cDNA library was screened with a 32Plabeled 5.2-kb WindIII genomic DNA fragment in 1 M NaC1, 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg/mL of denatured salmon sperm DNA at 6.5OC.\n\nFilters cvere washed twice with 2 X SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 5 min, and finally once with 0.5X SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65OC for 5 min. Positively hybridizing plaques were purified, and their plasmids were excised according to the protocol described in the pBluescript I1 Phagemid Kit (Stratagene) and subjected to sequencing as described above.\n\nThe Arabidopsis library was screened with 32P-labeled Arabidopsis CF3 cDNA (see \"Results\"). The soybean library was screened with 32P-labeled CF3 cDNA and a 1.0-kb IihaI fragment from soybean GM3 cDNA (see \"Results\"). The libraries were screened under low-stringency hybridization conditions in 1 M NaCI, 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1% (vu/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg/mL of denatured salmon sperm DNA at 50OC. Filters were washed twice with 2 X SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 5 min, and finally once with 0.5X SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 51D°C for 5 min. The rapeseed cDNA library was screened at low stringency with 32P-labeled Arabidopsis CF3 and CFD cDNAs (see \"Results\"). Filters were hybridized overnigh t in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 6X SSC, 5X Denhardt's solution, O 5% (w/v) SDS, 100 Pg denatured calf thymus DNA at 50°C and then washed sequentially in 6X SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 15 min; in 2X SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 45OC for 30 min; and twice with 0.2X SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 5OoC for 30 min. In a11 cases, several positively hybridizing phages were purified and their cDNA inserts were characterized by nucleotide sequencing, following excision, as described above.\n\nThe percent identity between and the multiple sequence alignment of the different deduced amino acid sequences were generated by Gap (by the method of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) and Lineup, respectively, in the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (Genetics Computer, Inc.). These were performed using gap weight and gap length weight values of 3.0 and 0.1, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the Hein (1990) algorithm using LaserGene Software (DNAStar, Inc.) on an Apple Macintosh computer .\n\nThe following Arabidopsis tissues were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen: expanding leaves from the rosette stage of wild-type and line 3707 Arabidopsis plants grown side by side in soil in the greenhouse, 2-week-old whole wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings (with roots) grown in coarse sand, and in vitro cultured roots (Russell et al., 1992). RNA was isolated as described in Rerie et al. (1991). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). RNA was fractionated on 1.2% (w/v) agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked by UV irradiation (Ausubel et al., 1991). RNA blots were hybridized at 6OoC with the 32P-labeled CF3 and CFD cDNAs (see \"Results\") and an Arabidopsis actin probe in 6X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 5X Denhardt's solution, 1.0% (w/v) SDS, 100 pg/mL of salmon sperm DNA, and were washed at 65OC to a stringency of 0.1X SSC. The actin probe, which served to normalize mRNA loadings, was obtained from RNA by reverse transcription and PCR amplification with primers corresponding to nucleotides 938 to 957 and nucleotides 1506 to 1524 of the AAcl gene (Nairn et al., 1988).\n\nFor constitutive expression in plants, the 1.4-kb CF3 cDNA (see \"Results\") was ligated in the sense orientation between the 35s promoter and the 3' region of the NOS (Russell et al., 1992) (see Fig. 4). For seed-specific expression, the cDNA insert was cloned in sense orientation between the promoter for the gene for the a-subunit of P-conglycinin (Doyle et al., 1986) and the 3' region of the phaseolin gene (Slightom et al., 1983). The chimeric genes were cloned adjacent to a plant-selectable marker between the T-DNA borders of a derivative of binary vector pZS94 (Russell et al., 1992) to provide plasmids pAW50 (P-conglycinin: CF3 cDNA) and pAW31 (35s: CF3 cDNA). The plant-selectable markers were sulfonylurea resistance (Russell et al., 1992) in plasmid pAW50 and kanamycin resistance (35S:NPT II:3'NOS, see Fig. 4) in plasmid pAW31. Plasmids pAW50 and pAW31 were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 (Hoekema et al., 1983) and A. tumefaciens strain RlOOO (a C58 strain carrying an Ri-plasmid) (Moore et al., 1979), respectively, by the freeze/thaw method (Holsters et al., 1978).\n\nComplementation of the mutation in line 3707 was carried out by transformation of root explants of line 3707 homozygous for the mutation by Agrobacterium strain LBA4404/ pAW50 (Russell et al., 1992). Primary transformants (RI) were selected on chlorsulfuron and transferred to individual containers as previously described (Russell et al., 1992). Individual RZ seeds from two independent transgenic plants were analyzed for fatty acid composition.\n\nCarrot (Daucus carota L.) cells were transformed by cocultivation of carrot root discs with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains RlOOO or R1000/pAW31 (Petit et al., 1986). Inoculated discs were incubated for 2 weeks at 25OC on an agar-solidified water medium and then transferred to a medium containing 500 mg/L of carbenicillin. Hairy roots that formed on the cut surfaces were excised and individually maintained on Murashige and Skoog minimal organics medium (Gibco) with 30 g/L of SUC and 500 mg/L of carbenicillin, with or without 50 pg/mL of kanamycin sulfate, and sampled for fatty acid composition.\n\nSince the T3 seeds of T-DNA-transformed lines are segregating for the T-DNA insert, we combined approximately 100 T3 seeds (2 mg) of each of 6000 members of the population of T-DNA-transformed lines of A. thaliana and determined the fatty acid content of each of the 6000 pooled samples (Browse et al., 1986). Based on our knowledge of chemically induced lipid mutants (James and Dooner, 1990;Lemieux et al., 1990), we expected to be able to identify mutants in a segregating line using this approach. Three lines with reduced 18:3 were identified, and each of these was shown to be segregating for the mutant phenotype. The first of these lines identified (line 3707) produced homozygous seeds that contained 3.1% 18:3 (Table I), suggesting that the mutation in this line is \"leaky\" compared with the previously described fad 3-2 mutant, which contains 1.9% 18:3 (James and Dooner, 1990). Individual plants of line 3707 were selfed, and 262 of the resultant T4 progeny were grown and assayed for the presence of nopaline in leaf extracts (Errampalli et al., 1991). In addition, T5 seeds from each of the T4 plants were analyzed in bulk for fatty acid composition and for their ability to germinate in the presente of kanamycin (Feldmann et al., 1989). The analysis showed that the T4 progeny of line 3707 fel1 into three classes (Table II), indicating that a single T-DNA insertion conditioned the low 18:3 phenotype in line 3707. The cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and T-DNA markers indicates with 95% certainty that the T-DNA and the mutation are no further than 1.2 cM apart. On the basis of this estimation of linkage, we proceeded to isolate plant DNA flanking the site of T-DNA insertion.\n\nSince the modified T-DNA we used contains the origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance gene of plasmid pBR322 (Feldmann and Marks, 1987), the left T-DNA-plant DNA junction fragments from line 3707 were recovered as plasmids in Escherichia coli by the method of plasmid rescue Table II. Co-segregation of mutant fatty acid phenotype and T-DNA markers in line 3707 Leaves of 262 individual T 4 plants derived from line 3707 were tested for the presence of nopaline, and their selfed, progeny seeds (T 5 ) were tested for the mutant fatty acid phenotype and kanamycin resistance. Number of T4 Individuals Phenotype 64 Nopaline absent in leaves; progeny (T 5 ) seeds show wild-type fatty acid composition and are all kanamycin sensitive 134 Nopaline present in leaves; progeny (T 5 ) seeds show heterozygous fatty acid composition similar to 3707 T 3 pool and segregate for kanamycin resistance 64 Nopaline present in leaves; progeny (T 5 ) seeds show the homozygous mutant fatty acid composition and are all kanamycin resistant\n\npresent to the right of the site of T-DNA insertion as shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence of CF3 cDNA revealed a large open reading frame (nucleotides 46-1206) that encodes a 386-amino acid polypeptide, designated A3 (Fig. 2). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence A3 to that of the polypeptide encoded by the structural gene (des A) for a cyanobacterium fatty acid desaturase (Wada et al., 1990) revealed an overall identity of 26% and higher identity over shorter stretches of amino acids. This strongly suggested that CF3 cDNA encoded Arabidopsis microsomal u>-3 fatty acid desaturase. Arabidopsis polypeptide A3 showed 93 and 68% overall identity to the subsequently published polypeptide sequences of rapeseed co-3 fatty acid desaturase (Arondel et al., 1992) and a mung bean cDNA, ARG1, made to IAAinduced mRNA (Yamamoto et al., 1992), respectively. However, it showed overall identities of only 21 and 17% to the microsomal stearoyl-CoA desaturases from rat (Thiede et al., 1986) and yeast (Stukey et al., 1990), respectively. No significant homology was observed with the soluble stearoyl-acyl (Behringer and Medford, 1992). For this, line 3707 genomic DNA was isolated, digested with either Sail or BamHI restriction enzyme, self-ligated, and used to transform E. coli cells. This resulted in the isolation of plasmids pSl and pBl from the Sail-and BamHI-digested DNAs, respectively. Restriction analysis of these plasmids showed that, in addition to the expected fragments of the T-DNA, pSl contained a 2.9-kb EcoRI-Sa/I fragment and pBl contained a 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment (in each case, the EcoRI site being in the left T-DNA border), and that the 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment in pBl was contained within the 2.9-kb EcoRl-Sall fragment in pSl. Southern analysis using a radiolabeled 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment as the hybridization probe showed that it hybridized to specific fragments of genomic DNA from both wildtype and line 3707 plants (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence of approximately 0.8 kb of the junction fragment starting from the EcoRI site in plasmid pSl was determined; it was co-linear with the sequence of the T-DNA up to nucleotide position 65 in the left T-DNA border repeat (Yadav et al., 1982). The sequence beyond this point of divergence showed no significant identity to the T-DNA and revealed no extended open reading frame.\n\nTo isolate a cDNA corresponding to the site of T-DNA insertion, we isolated the corresponding genomic DNA from wild-type plants. For this we used the 32 P-labeled 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment as the hybridization probe to screen a phage library made to wild-type Arabidopsis genomic DNA. Southern analysis of DNA isolated from several positively hybridizing clones showed that a 5.2-kb Hi'ndlll fragment (Fig. 1) hybridized to the 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment. The 5.2-kb Hmdlll fragment was isolated and used, in turn, as a probe to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library. Several positively hybridizing plaques were purified and their plasmids were excised. One plasmid contained a 1.4-kb cDNA, designated CF3, which was shown by Southern analysis to hybridize to a region of wild-type Arabidopsis genomic DNA   carrier protein desaturases from higher plants (Shanklin and Somerville, 1991;Thompson et al., 1991). Southern analysis of genomic DNA from wild-type and line 3707 plants using 32P-labeled CF3 cDNA showed that the T-DNA integrated 5' to the desaturase coding sequence (Fig. 1). To accurately determine the site of T-DNA integration, the right T-DNA-plant DNA junction fragment was isolated by screening a Iibrary made to genomic DNA from line 3707 with 32P-labeled CF3 cDNA. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type w-3 desaturase gene with those of the T-DNA-disrupted gene in the left and right junction fragments showed that the insertion in line 3707 resulted in a 56-bp deletion at the site of integration that occurred 612 bp 5' to the initiation codon for the desaturase coding sequence.\n\nNorthern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from leaf tissues of wild-type Arabidopsis and line 3707 homozygous for the low 18:3 phenotype showed that, relative to the wildtype tissue, the mutant tissue contained about one-fifth to one-tenth the amount of an apparently full-length w-3 desaturase mRNA (Fig. 3). The above data, taken together with the leaky mutant phenotype in line 3707, suggest that the T-\n\nwild type 3707 pCF3 pCFD actin 1.3kb 1.4kb 1.3kb\n\nL R S L Figure 3. RNA gel-blot analysis of Arabidopsis using CF3 and CFD probes. Poly(A)\" 1 \" mRNAs (0.3 ^g) isolated from expanding leaves (L) from wild-type and line 3707 rosette-stage plants, in vitro cultured wild-type roots (R), and 2-week-old wild-type seedlings (S) were separated on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gels, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to 32 P-labeled CF3 cDNA, CFD cDNA, or AAcI actin probe. The sizes of the hybridizing mRNAs are indicated. The same blot was hybridized sequentially with CF3 and CFD probes to determine the relative prevalences of the corresponding mRNAs in these tissues. The actin probe was used as a loading control. Autoradiographs for CF3 and CFD probes were exposed for 12 h at -70°C, and that for the actin probe was exposed for 24 h at -70 \"C.\n\nDNA insertion altered the quantitative expression of the microsomal u>-3 fatty acid desaturase without physically interrupting its mRNA.\n\nTo confirm the identity of the gene product encoded by CF3 cDNA, the complete cDNA was introduced in the sense orientation behind a seed-specific promoter into line 3707. Five of six R 2 seeds from each of two independent transgenic plants tested showed more than a 10-fold increase in 18:3 level (Table III). The remaining seed from each transformant showed the mutant fatty acid phenotype.\n\nCF3 cDNA was also introduced into carrot roots in the sense orientation behind the 35S promoter in binary vector pAW31 via the binary Ri plasmid transformation method. By this method, only a fraction (about half) of the hairy roots formed in the absence of the kanamycin selection will be transformed with both the Ri plasmid and the experimental plasmid, if present. The average 18:3 content in nine of the control hairy roots (transformed with R1000 strain without an experimental vector) was 9.2%, SE 0.3%. Of the 20 hairy roots transformed with R1000 strain containing pAW31 and grown in the absence of kanamycin, 6 showed a high content of 18:3 (average 62%, SE 0.4%), 2 showed an intermediate content (average 19%, SE 4%), and 12 showed the normal content (average 7.6%, SE 2.2%) compared with the control. Thus, overexpression of the cDNA in some carrot roots resulted in the conversion of up to 94% of the endogenous 18:2 into 18:3 (Fig. 4).\n\nThere was no significant change in fatty acids other than 18:2 and 18:3. Five roots of the high class (numbers 4, 19, 22, 23, and 25), one root of the intermediate class (number 36), one root with normal 18:3 (number 20), and one R1000 control root were tested for their ability to grow on kanamycin and for the presence of the chimeric gene in their genomic DNA. Roots 4, 19, 22, and 25 were kanamycin resistant, root 36 was weakly kanamycin resistant, and roots 20 and 23 and the R1000 control root were kanamycin sensitive. Southern analyses using 32 P-labeled 35S:CF3 cDNA:3'NOS chimeric gene showed that all roots of the high and intermediate classes contained the chimeric gene, whereas the root with normal 18:3 (number 20) and the R1000 control root did not (Fig. 4). It is unclear if the intermediate content of 18:3 in root 36 is related to the reduced intensity of hybridization to the 1.4-kb fragment in this root. Root 23 has an apparent deletion of approximately 0.5 kb in the 4.4-kb Hmdlll fragment, and its kanamycin sensitivity suggests that the deletion is in the 35S:NPTII:3'NOS chimeric gene.\n\nAn Arabidopsis cDNA Encoding a Homolog of the Microsomal o>-3 Desaturase 32 P-labeled CF3 cDNA was used as a hybridization probe at low stringency to screen the Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyl cDNA library (Kieber et al., 1993). Several weakly hybridizing plaques were purified and their plasmids were excised and partially sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of 1550 bp of the cDNA insert, designated CFD, in one plasmid revealed an open reading frame encoding a 446-amino acid polypeptide, designated Ap, with an estimated molecular mass of 51 kD. Alignment of polypeptide Ap sequence with that of the Arabidopsis microsomal o>-3 desaturase showed an overall Table III. fatty acid composition of seeds of line 3707 transformed with /3-conglycinin promoter:CF3cDNA:3'NOS chimeric gene Wild-type and mutant 3707 compositions are each an average of three individual seeds. Samples A-1 to A-6 are individual R 2 seeds from one 3707 transformant, and samples B-1 to B-6 are individual R 2 seeds from an independent 3707 transformant. The level of each fatty acid is shown as a percentage of all five.\n\n6 16:0 8.2 0.20 8.7 0.16 10.3 10.1 10.8 12.0 10.4 10.5 10.6 10.1 8.9 10.3 9.8 10.4 18:0 5.5 0.32 5.1 0.04 4.3 4.0 6.1 7.4 4.4 4.8 4.9 5.0 4.2 5.2 4.7 5.3 18:1 19.3 0.46 19.8 0.82 29.8 22.2 21.5 16.5 18.6 15.4 19.6 19.2 27.1 17.3 19.5 16.9 18:2 41.4 0.30 61.8 0.92 51.5 9.2 13.6 5.5 17.7 15.1 61.0 9.2 7.8 9.9 9.2 17.8 18:3 25.7 0.08 4.5 0.19 4.1 54.5 48.0 56.7 49.0 54.1 4.0 56.5 52.0 57.4 56.8 49.5 www.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

It also revealed an approximately 63-amino acid N-terminal extension (Fig. 2).\n\nThe N-terminal Met is the only Met in the N-terminal extension and the extension has several characteristics of transit peptides of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. These include a high content of hydroxylated residues (the sequence is 21% Ser), a low content of acidic residues (only one residue each of Glu and Asp compared with eight basic residues), and the highly conserved N-terminal dipeptide Met-Ala (de Boer and Weisbeek, 1991;von Heinji and Nishikawa, 1991). Northern analyses of poly(A) + RNA from wild-type Arabidopsis leaf, seedling, and cultured root tissues showed that the mRNAs corresponding to CF3 and CFD cDNAs were differentially accumulated in leaf and root tissues. CF3 mRNA was about five times more abundant in leaf than in root tissues. CFD mRNA, in contrast, accumulated at a high level in leaf and seedling tissues and at only a trace level in root tissue. In addition, in leaf tissue CFD mRNA was about three times more abundant than CF3 mRNA, whereas in root tissue CF3 mRNA was much more abundant than CFD mRNA (Fig. 3).\n\nCFD cDNA was hybridized to genomic DNA from A. thaliana (ecotype Wassileskija and marker line W100 ecotype Landesberg background) digested with EcoRI. A restriction fragment length polymorphism was identified and mapped as previously described (Reiter et al., 1992). A single genetic locus corresponding to this cDNA was positioned on the upper arm of chromosome 3 at a position 8 ± 2 cM proximal to cosmid c3838 restriction fragment length polymorphism marker, 9 ± 2 cM distal to the X AT228 marker, and 39 ± 7 cM distal to the glabrous (gl-1) locus (Reiter et al., 1992).\n\ncDNA libraries representing the mRNA population of soybean and rapeseed cotyledons actively engaged in oil biosynthesis were screened at a low stringency for cDNAs related to Arabidopsis CF3 and CFD cDNAs. The rapeseed library was screened with 32 P-labeled CF3 and CFD cDNAs. Several cross-hybridizing clones were purified in each case and subjected to nucleotide sequence analyses. Rapeseed cDNA, designated BN3, was 1336 bp and contained a large open reading frame that encodes a 377-amino acid polypeptide, designated C3. Rapeseed cDNA, designated BND, contained a 1416-bp sequence with an incomplete open reading frame that encodes a 404-amino acid polypeptide, designated Cp. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of rapeseed polypeptides C3 and Cp and Arabidopsis polypeptides A3 and Ap showed that C3 and Cp polypeptides are homologs of the Arabidopsis microsomal and putative plastid oj-3 desaturases, respectively. This conclusion is based on percent identity at the amino acid level (Table IV) and the presence or absence of an N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 2), even though the deduced amino acid in BND cDNA contains only part of the putative transit peptide sequence.\n\nThe soybean cDNA library was screened with 32 P-labeled CF3 cDNA and one of the purified clones was shown to contain a cDNA insert, designated GM3, with a large open reading frame that encodes a 380-amino acid polypeptide, designated S3. A 1-kb Hhal fragment of GM3 cDNA was isolated and used to rescreen the soybean cDNA library at low stringency. This resulted in the isolation of a distinct cDNA, designated GMD, that contained an open reading frame that encodes a 454-amino acid polypeptide, designated Sp. Comparison of the soybean polypetides S3 and Sp with rapeseed polypeptides C3 and Cp and Arabidopsis polypep-\n\nThe nomenclature of the homologs is the same as in Figure 2.\n\nA3 Ap C3 Cp S3 Ap 66 C3 93 67 Cp 66 90 68 S3 68 67 68 68 SP 67 69 68 74 68\n\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 103,1993 tides A3 and Ap showed that S3 and Sp polypeptides are homologs of the Arubidopsis microsomal and putative plastid w-3 desaturases, respectively. This conclusion is based largely on the presence or absence of an N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 2 ) but also partly on the percent identity at the amino acid level (Table IV). The N-terminal sequence in the deduced amíno acid sequence of GMD cDNA is authentic, because the open reading frame in GMD cDNA has an inframe termination codon 5' to the initiation codon and its ' deduced amino acid sequence begins at the only Met residue in it. Since it also shares characteristics of transit peptides of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins, including the N-ter-mina1 dipeptide Met-Ala, we deduce that it is the transit peptide.\n\nAlthough T-DNA tagging has been useful in cloning plant genes, the genes that have been isolated have been those that affect visible, easily scored multigenic traits (Feldmann, 1991). This report provides support for the utility of T-DNA tagging in cloning an arbitrary gene for which there is only a specific assay for gene function. Statistical analysis would suggest that, assuming random insertion of the T-DNA into the Arubidopsis genome (100 Mbp), screening the present population of approximately 12,000 Arabidopsis transformants containing approximately 16,000 T-DNA inserts (Feldmann, 1991) would provide a 30 to 40% chance of uncovering a mutant at an arbitrary locus of 2.5 to 3 kb. If, as some surmise (Walden et al., 1991), the T-DNA insertion is biased toward transcriptionally active regions of the genome, then the probability of uncovering active genes increases correspondingly .\n\nThe identification of the polypeptide encoded by CF3 cDNA as the microsomal w-3 fatty acid desaturase is based on its complementation of the mutation in line 3707. Expression of the Arubidopsis enzyme in line 3707, under the control of a seed-specific promoter, resulted in a 12-fold increase in 18:3 content when compared with the untransformed mutant 3707, and a 2-fold increase in 18:3 content when compared with the wild-type control. Overexpression of the Arubidopsis enzyme in carrot hairy roots resulted in a more than 7-fold increase in the 18:3 content, and almost a11 endogenous 18:2 was converted to 18:3. Overexpression of the rapeseed enzyme in wild-type Arubidopsis roots was previously reported to result in a 1.6-fold increase in 18:3 content (Arondel et al., 1992). Thus, the reaction catalyzed by w-3 desaturase appears to be a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of 18:3 i n Arubidopsis seeds as well as in Arabidopsis roots and carrot hairy roots. This observation is supported by genetic studies with fud 3 mutants that indicate gene dosage-dependence of the fud 3 phenotype (Lemieux et al., 1990). If, as seems likely, the 0-3 desaturase enzyme is also rate limiting in agronomically important oilseeds such as rapeseed or soybean, then the alteration of the 18:3 content in the triacylglycerols of these plants by transgenic approaches should prove practicable.\n\nMutants of Arubidopsis with specific alterations in membrane lipid composition have provided considerable information about the effects of lipid structure on membrane function (Somerville and Browse, 199 1). However, these mutants have invariably exhibited decreases in unsaturation relative to wild-type plants. The isolation of the w-3 defjaturase gene and the demonstration that overexpression of its coding sequence can result in very high 18:3 conterit in transgenic plants will now enable the study of the physicllogy and cell biology of plants in which the levels of membrane unsaturation are higher than normal.\n\nCFD cDNA, which was isolated using CF3 cDNA as a hybridization probe at low stringency, encodes polypeptide Ap, which is a structural homolog of the microsomal fatty acid desaturase, but with an N-terminal extension (Fig. 2). This N-terminal sequence is deduced to be a transit peptide because it shares severa1 characteristics of transit peptides of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. These include a liigh content of hydroxylated residues, a low content of acidic residues, and the N-terminal dipeptide Met-Ala (de Boer and Weisbeek, 1991;von Heinji and Nishikawa, 1991). In addition, it is co-linear with, and shares limited homology to, the deduced transit peptide described for the soybean putative plastid w-3 desaturase. mRNA corresponding to CFD CENA accumulates at very high levels in leaf but not in root tissue (Fig. 3). Finally, CFD cDNA maps 39 k 7 cM distal to the gl-l locus. Two plastid fatty acid desaturation mutations, fad D and fud B, were mapped 40 f 6 and 28 & 6 cM, respectively, distal to the gl-I locus (Hugly et al., 1991). Thus, the rnap position for the gene encoding CFD cDNA is consistent vrith that of the Arabidopsis fud D locus, which controls plastid w-3 desaturation. Based on the above discussion, we postulate that the CFD cDNA is derived from the fud D locus and encodes the plastid a-3 fatty acid desaturase. This conclusion will be confirmed by the biological expression of the CFD cDNA.\n\nRapeseed polypeptide C3 was identified as the microsoinal w-3 desaturase by its high (93%) identity at the amino acid level to Arubidopsis microsomal w-3 desaturase. The rapeseed W-3 desaturase reported in this study had a 96% amino acid sequence identity with the previously reported rapeseed (0-3 desaturase. It seems likely, therefore, that the two rapeseed polypeptides are isozymes. Soybean polypeptide S 3 has 68% and 67% identity with Arubidopsis microsomal and putative plastid w-3 desaturases, respectively. Since it lacks the Nterminal extension transit peptide, we postulate that it encodes the microsomal w-3 desaturase.\n\nSoybean polypeptide Sp contains an N-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide. The length of the deduced transit peptide in Sp is similar to that in Ap, the putative plastid W-3 desaturase of Arubidopsis. Although there is little amino acid sequence identity with the Arabidopsis transit peptide, the extension has characteristics similar to those of transit peptides of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. Thus, it is likely that soybean polypeptide Sp is a plastid w-3 fatty acid desaturase. The rapeseed BND cDNA encodes a polypeptide, Cp, that was identified to be the plastid w-3 desaturase based on a 90% identity to the Arabidopsis putative plastid desaturase, but the rapeseed cDNA is incomplete and encodes only a part of a putative transit peptide. Our identification of the rapeseed and soybean polypeptides is supported by the phylogenetic analysis based on Hein's alignment algorithm (Hein, 1990). This algorithm assumes that the sequences are related in some way and constructs a phylogeny based on evolutionary parsimony (Fig. 5). The analysis shows that the earliest divergence in ancestral relationships is between the group of sequences we have identified as microsomal w-3 fatty acid desaturases and the group we have identified as putative plastid w-3 fatty acid desaturases. Based on these homologies, it is also apparent that the previously unidentified mung bean cDNA (ARG1) (Yamamoto et al., 1992) encodes a mung bean microsomal w-3 desaturase.\n\nMicrosomal w-3 desaturases from Arabidopsis and rapeseed, both in this and the previously published report (Aron-de1 et al., 1992), share the motif of two Lys residues positioned three and five residues from the C terminus that is believed to be sufficient for retention of transmembrane ER proteins (Jackson et al., 1990). This motif is absent from the putative plastid homologs from a11 three species. However, its significance is unclear because the soybean homolog S3 lacks it altogether, and the mung bean homolog (encoded by ARGl cDNA) (Yamamoto et al., 1992) shows a Lys-Ser-Lys tripeptide at the C terminus. Additional soybean homologs of polypeptide S3 are being investigated.\n\nComparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the different w-3 desaturase homologs, of both the microsomal and the putative plastid types, shows that they have overall identities of 66% or greater at the amino acid levels (Table IV). It also shows that the percent identity between the microsomal and the putative plastid desaturases within each species is similar to that between the soybean and Arubidopsis microsomal(68%) or plastid (69%) homologs.\n\nWe were not successful in cloning the microsomal w-6 fatty acid desaturase from the Arubidopsis cDNA library using 32Plabeled CF3 and CFD cDNAs as probes under low stringency hybridization conditions in which CF3 and CFD cDNAs cross-hybridize. This suggests that the microsomal w-3 desaturase is more closely related to the putative plastid w-3 desaturase than it is to the microsomal w-6 desaturase. There is evidence that microsomal desaturations use phosphatidylcholine as the lipid substrate and Cyt bs as the immediate electron donor (Smith et al., 1990), whereas plastid desaturations (Schmidt and Heinz, 1990) and cyanobacterial desaturations (Wada et al., 1993) use galactolipids as the lipid substrate and reduced Fd as the electron donor. Because microsomal and plastid desaturations use different lipid substrates and immediate electron donors, the high degree of similarity between the primary structures of the microsomal w-3 desaturase and its putative plastid homolog suggests a  (Hein, 1990). The length of the branches is proportional to the evolutionary divergence. ARGl is the auxin-induced mung bean cDNA (Yamamoto et al., 1992); other nomenclature is the same as in Figure 2.\n\nconserved enzyme mechanism and common structural motifs that recognize the 18:2 fatty acyl moiety.\n\nPlant Physiol.Vol. 103, 1993\n\nThis research was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant DCB-90084232 and U.S. Department of Agriculture grant 9237301-7728 to J.B.Present address: Department of Plant Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 87521.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.
