    "abstract": "Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is autofluorescent. This property has made GFP useful in monitoring in vivo activities such as gene expression and protein localization. We find that GFP can be used in vitro to reveal and characterize protein-protein interactions. The interaction between the S-peptide and S-protein fragments of ribonuclease A was chosen as a model system. GFP-tagged S-peptide was produced, and the interaction of this fusion protein with S-protein was analyzed by two distinct methods: fluorescence gel retardation and fluorescence polarization. The fluorescence gel retardation assay is a rapid method to demonstrate the existence of a protein-protein interaction and to estimate the dissociation constant ( K d ) of the resulting complex. The fluorescence polarization assay is an accurate method to evaluate Kd in a specified homogeneous solution and can be adapted for the high-throughput screening of protein or peptide libraries. These two methods are powerful new tools to probe protein-protein interactions.",

These properties endow GFP with enormous potential for biotechnical applications (Bokman &Ward, 1981;Ward, 1981;Ward & Bokman, 1982). To date, GFP has been used largely in vivo-as a marker for gene expression and a fusion tag to monitor protein localization in living cells (Chalfie et al., 1994;Inouye & Tsuji, 1994;Ren et al., 1996).\n\nThe cDNA that codes for GFP was cloned five years ago (Prasher et al., 1992). Since then, a variety of GFP variants have been generated in response to the demand for improved properties that could broaden the spectrum of its application (Cubitt et al., 1995;Delagrave et al., 1995;Ehrig et al., 1995;Heim et al., 1995;Crameri et al., 1996). Among those variants, S65T GFP is unique in having increased fluorescence intensity, faster fluorophore formation, and altered excitation and emission spectra than that of the wild-type protein (Heim et al., 1995). Recently, the groups of Phillips and Remington have determined the crystalline structures of wild-type (Yang et al., 1996) and S65T (Ormo et al., 1996) GFP by X-ray diffraction analysis. These studies indicate that the fluorophore is held rigidly within the protein. The wavelengths of the excitation and emission maxima of S65T GFP (490 nm and 510 nm, respectively) resemble closely those of fluorescein. The Reprint requests to: Ronald T. Raines, Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706-1569; e-mail: raines@biochem.wisc.edu. fluorescein-like spectral characteristics of S65T GFP enable its use with instrumentation, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) devices or fluorescence microscopes, that had been designed specifically for use with fluorescein.\n\nHere, we demonstrate the use of S65T GFP as the basis of two new methods for exploring protein-protein interactions. The first is a fluorescence gel retardation assay. The gel retardation assay has been used widely to study protein-DNA interactions (Carey, 1991). This assay is based on the electrophoretic mobility of a protein-DNA complex being less than that of either molecule alone. In our fluorescence gel retardation assay, we use this principle, together with the fluorescent properties of S65T GFP, which is fused to one of the interacting proteins. The second is a fluorescence polarization assay. A complex between two molecules rotates more slowly than do the free molecules. The resulting increase in rotational correlation time gives rise to an increase in fluorescence polarization (LeTilly & Royer, 1993;Jameson & Sawyer, 1995). Fluoresence polarization assays usually rely on fluorescein as an exogenous fluorophore. In our fluorescence polarization assay, we show that S65T GFP can serve as well or better in this role.\n\nTo demonstrate the potential of S65T GFP in exploring proteinprotein interactions, we have chosen as a model system the wellcharacterized interaction of the S-peptide and S-protein fragments of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) A. Subtilisin treatment of RNase A yields two tightly associated polypeptide chains: S-peptide (residues 1-20) and S-protein (residues 21-124) (Richards, 1955). Although the two individual polypeptide chains are inactive, full enzymatic activity is restored upon complex formation (Richards & Vithayathil, 1959). Because a truncated form of S-peptide (S15, residues 1-15) is necessary and sufficient to form an enzymatically active complex with S-protein (Potts et al., 1963). we used SI5 in our studies. Specifically, we generated fusion proteins in which S 15 is fused to the N or C terminus of S65T GFP.\n\nDNA encoding SI5 and six histidine residues (His6; Hochuli et al., 1988) was added to the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA encoding S65T GFP. The two resulting proteins, His6-GFP(S65T)-s1S and SI5-GFP(S65T)-His6 (Fig. IA), were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+ -NTA column (Fig. IB). The presence of an intact and functional S 15 sequence on the fusion proteins was confirmed by zymogram electrophoresis in a poly(C)-containing gel, which was then incubated with S-protein (Fig. IC) (Kim & Raines, 1993, 1994). Both His6-GFP(S65T)-S15 and S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 remain fluorescent after electrophoresis in a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2A). Further, the altered excitation and emission spectra of S65T GFP are well suited for detection by a fluorimager. The sensitivity of S65T GFP detection in a native polyacrylamide gel is 20.1 ng (data not shown), which is comparable to that of an immunoblot using an anti-GFP antibody (Colby et al., 1995).\n\nPurified His6-GFP(S65T)-s15 migrates as two distinct species during SDS-PAGE (Fig. IB), zymogram electrophoresis (Fig. lC), and native PAGE (Fig. 2A). No unexpected mutations are present in the gene encoding His6\"GFP(S65T)-S15. The results of Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and zymogram electrophoresis indicate that both the N and the C termini of His6-GFP(S65T)-S15 are intact (Kim & Raines, 1994). Apparently, two isoforms of His6-GFP(S65T)-s15 exist that migrate differently during electrophoresis, even in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1B).\n\nGel mobility retardation is a popular tool for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of protein-nucleic acid interactions (Carey, 1991). The fluorescence gel retardation assay shown in Figure 2B is the first to apply gel retardation to the study of a protein-protein interaction. In this assay, free and bound S15-tagged S65T GFP were resolved and visualized in a native polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 2B, only the slower migrating isoform of His6-GFP(S65T)-S15 was shifted upon binding to S-protein during native PAGE, indicating that only this species has an accessible S15. The SI5 portion of the faster migrating species is inaccessible to S-protein, perhaps because it becomes buried inside the GFP moiety during the folding process. We therefore believe it to be prudent to construct GFP fusions in which the target protein is fused to the N terminus of GFP, rather than to the C terminus. All subsequent experiments were performed with S15-GFP(S65T)-His6.\n\nThe fluorescence gel retardation assay was used to quantify the interaction between S-protein and S15-GFP(S65T)-His6. A fixed quantity of S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 was incubated with a varying quantity of S-protein prior to electrophoresis in a native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was scanned with a fluorimager and the fluorescence intensities of bound and free SlS\"GFP(S65T)-His6 were quantified (Fig. 3A). From the relative fluorescence intensities of the bound and free S15- GFP(S65T)-His6, the binding ratio (R = fluorescence intensity of bound S15-GFP(S65T)-His6/total fluorescence intensity) at each concentration was obtained. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the complex formed in the presence of different S-protein concentrations was calculated from the values of R and the total concentrations of S-protein and SIS-GFP(S65T)-His6. The average (+SD) value of K d is (6 * 3) X lo-* M. (w/v) polyacrylamide gel at 4°C at 10 V/cm and scanned by a fluorimager using an internal filter set. Lane 1, I pM SI5-GFP(S6ST)-His, and no S-protein: lane 2. 1 pM SIS-GFP(S65T)-His6 and 1 pM S-protein: lane 3, 1 pM His6-GFP(S65T)-S15 and no S-protein: lane 4, I pM H~s~-GFP(S~ST)-SI~ with I pM S-protein.\n\nA competition assay was used to probe the specificity of the interaction between S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 and S-protein. S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 and S-protein were incubated to allow for complex formation. Varying amounts of S-peptide were added and the resulting mixture was incubated further, and then subjected to native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 3B, the addition of S-peptide converts bound S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 to the free state. We conclude that S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 and S-peptide bind to the same region of S-protein.\n\nThe fluorescence gel retardation assay is a convenient method to visualize a protein-protein interaction as well as to estimate the K d of the resulting complex. Still, gel retardation assays have an intrinsic limitation in measuring accurate dissociation constants. In a gel retardation assay, it is assumed that a receptor-ligand interaction remains at equilibrium during sample loading and electrophoresis. Yet, as samples are loaded and migrate through a gel. complex dissociation is unavoidable and results in an underestimation of the value of Kd. Furthermore. if the conditions (e.g., pH or salt type or concentration) encountered during electrophoresis differ from those in the incubation, then the measured value of K d could be inaccurate.\n\nFluorescence polarization was used to quantify the interaction between S-protein and S15-tagged S65T GFP. In this assay, the formation of a complex is deduced from an increase in fluorescence polarization, and the dissociation constants are determined in a homogeneous aqueous environment. Most applications of fluorescence polarization assay have used fluorescein as a fluorophore (LeTilly & Royer. 1993;Radek et al., 1993;Wittmayer & Raines, 1996). We reasoned that the complex between S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 and S-protein is likely to rotate more slowly and therefore to have a higher rotational correlation time than does free S15-GFP(S65T)-His6. Such an increase in rotational correlation time results in an increase in fluorescence polarization, which can be used to assess complex formation. In contrast to a gel retardation assay, a fluorescence polarization assay is performed in a homogeneous solution in which the conditions can be dictated precisely.\n\nFluorescence polarization was used to determine the effect of pH on complex formation. As shown in Figure 4A, the K d values obtained were 1.4 X lo-* M, 1.1 X lo-* M. and 1.0 X lo-* M at pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5, respectively. The interaction between S-protein and Sl5-GFP(S65T)-His6 was not affected significantly by changing the pH by 1.0 unit.\n\nThe insensitivity of K d values to the pH change (pH 7.5 to pH 8.5) was not unexpected, as none of the amino acid side chains involved in the interaction is known to change its protonation state in this pH range. The K d\n\n(1.4 X lo-' M) at pH 7.5 is approximately fourfold lower than the  with S-protein. S-protein was added to 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer in a volume of 1.0 mL. Each data point is an average of 5-7 measurements. Curves were obtained by fitting the data to Equation 2. A: Effect of pH change on the interaction in the absence of added NaCI.\n\nValues of Kd at pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 were 1.4 X lo-' M, 1.1 X lo-' M, and 1.0 X IO-' M, respectively. Mean values of fm,n and A f were (415.4 * 3.0) mP and (17.2 f 2.0) mP, respectively. B: Effect of NaCl concentration on the interaction at pH 8.0. Values of Kd in the presence of 0 and 0.10 M NaCl were 1.1 X lo-' M and 4.2 X lo-' M, respectively. K,, (6 X IO-* M) obtained by the fluorescence gel retardation assay performed at the same pH. The difference in the Kd values is consistent with an increase in complex dissociation during the course of the gel retardation assay.\n\nFluorescence polarization was used to determine the effect of salt concentration on complex formation. The value of Kd increased by 3.8-fold when NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.10 M (Fig. 4B). A similar salt dependence for the dissociation of RNase S had been observed previously (Schreier & Baldwin, 1977). The added salt is likely to disturb the water molecules hydrating the hydrophobic patch in the complex between S-peptide and S-protein, resulting in a decrease in the binding affinity (Baldwin, 1996). Finally, the value of Kd (4.2 X IOp8 M) that we observed in 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0, containing NaCl (0.10 M) was similar (i.e., 2.6-fold lower) to that obtained by titration calorimetry in 50 mh4 sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 mM) (Connelly et al., 1990).\n\nMethods to reveal and characterize the noncovalent interaction of one molecule with another are necessary to understand and control such interactions (Attie & Raines, 1995;Winzor & Sawyer, 1995). We have developed two new methods for probing protein-protein interactions. The first method is a fluorescence gel retardation assay in which one protein is fused to GFP. The GFP fusion protein is incubated with the other protein, and the mixture is separated by native PAGE. The interaction between the two proteins is evident by a decrease in the mobility of the fluorescent fusion protein that results from complex formation.\n\nThe fluorescence gel shift assay is a fast and convenient way to demonstrate interactions between two proteins and, in addition, allows for an estimation of the value of Kd for the resulting complex. Conventional methods to demonstrate an interaction between two proteins (e.g., protein A and protein B) are more laborious and less informative. In a typical method, protein A is fused to an affinity tag (such as glutathione S-transferase), which is then used to immobilize protein A on a resin. Protein B is applied to the resin to allow for complex formation. The complex is eluted and detected by an immunoblot using an antibody to protein B. In contrast, the fluorescence gel retardation assay requires simply mixing a protein A-GFP fusion protein with protein B, separating the mixture by native PAGE, and scanning the gel with a fluorimager. The interaction between protein A and protein B is apparent from the shift of the protein A-GFP band that results from complex formation. The sensitivity of S65T GFP detection (20.1 ng) challenges that of an immunoblot using an anti-GFP antibody (Colby et al., 1995). Moreover, the sensitivity of GFP detection is likely to improve as brighter GFP variants become available.\n\nThe second new method for probing protein-protein interactions, a fluorescence polarization assay, provides a more accurate assessment of the value of Kd. Most applications of fluorescence polarization assay have focused on analyzing protein-DNA interactions, with fluorescein (linked to DNA) serving as the fluorophore. In our assay, a GFP fusion protein is titrated with another protein, and the dissociation constant is obtained from the change in fluorescence polarization that accompanies binding. The interaction between the two proteins is detected in a homogeneous solution rather than a gel matrix. The fluorescence polarization assay thereby allows for the determination of accurate values of Kd in a wide range of solution conditions. GFP is particularly wellsuited to this application because its fluorophore is held rigidly within the protein (Ormo et al., 1996;Yang et al., 1996). Such a rigid fluorophore minimizes local rotational motion, thereby ensuring that changes in polarization report on changes to the global rotational motion of GFP, as effected by a protein-protein interaction. Finally, it is worth noting that this assay is amenable to the high-throughput screening of protein or peptide libraries for effective ligands (Jolley, 1996).\n\nAnother advantage of these new methods is the ease with which a protein can be fused to GFF using recombinant DNA techniques and the integrity of the resulting fusion protein. Traditionally, fluorophores have been attached to proteins by chemical modification with reagents such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). In this approach, additional purification steps are necessary to separate labeled protein from the reagent and unlabeled protein. Further, labeling the protein at a single site can be difficult or impossible.\n\nIn contrast, labeling a protein with GFP is complete and generates a single species. Purification of that species can be facilitated by the incorporation of an affinity tag such as Hisb (Hochuli et al., 1988) or SI5 (Kim & Raines, 1994). The success of S65T GFP as the fluorophore in fluorescence gel retardation assays and fluorescence polarization assays arises largely from the altered spectral characteristics and increased fluorescence intensity of S65T GFP (Heim et al., 1995). We suggest that the role of fluorescein as a fluorescent label can be replaced by S65T GFP in many biochemical analyses.\n\nThe His6 tag and S65T mutation were introduced simultaneously into the cDNA that codes for wild-type GFP [TU#58 from Chalfie et al. (1994)] by PCR mutagenesis (Picard et al., 1994) using three primers: P39 (GGCATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACGGCG GTAGCAAAGGAGAAGAAC for the His6 tag and an Nde I site),\n\nTTCAATGCTT for the S65T change), and P36 (GTGAATTCTT GTATAGTTCA TCCATGCCA for an EcoR I site). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoR I and Nde I and inserted into an EcoR I/Nde I site of PET-29a (Novagen; Madison, Wisconsin) by the TIES method (Zeng et al., 1996) (which was used because of an internal Nde I site in GFP gene). The DNA fragment encoding SI5 was generated from PET-29a by PCR using P37 (GGGAATTCCGGCGGCAAAGAAACCGCTGCT GCTAAA with an EcoR I site) andP38 (TGGTCGACTTAGCTGTCCATGTGCTGG CGTTCGA with a Sal I site) and inserted into EcoR I/Sal I site of the above plasmid to give pSH24.\n\nThe coding region of GFP(S65T) was amplified from pSH24 with P53 (TCAAGATCTTAGCAAAGGAGAAGAACTT with a Bgl I1 site) and P54 (GCCCTCGAGCTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGC with an Xho I site). The PCR fragment was digested with Bgl I1 and Xho I and inserted into Bgl II/Xho I site of PET-29b to give pSH41.\n\nHisb-GFP(S65T)-S15 and SI5-GFP(S65T)-His6\n\nwere produced from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)/pSH24 and BL21(DE3)/ pSH41, respectively. Cells were grown at 37 \"C in 0.5 L of LB medium until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.5, IFTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the cells were grown at 30°C for an additional 4 h. The culture was harvested and resuspended in 25 mL of 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing NaCl (0.3 M), DTT (0.5 mM), and PMSF (0.2 mM), and the cells were lysed by using a French pressure cell. The lysed cells were subjected to centrifugation at 18,000 X g. The supernatant was collected and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA agarose column (Qiagen; Chatsworth, California). The column was washed with 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing imidazole (8 mM), NaCl (0.3 M), and PMSF (0.5 mM). GFP(S65T) fusion proteins were eluted in the same buffer containing imidazole (0.10 M). The green fractions were pooled and further purified by FPLC on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia; Piscataway, New Jersey) with elution by 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9.\n\nPurified fusion proteins were quantified by using the extinction coefficient [ E = 39.2 mM\" cm\" at 490 nm (Heim et al., 1995)] of S65T GFP. S-protein (Sigma Chemical; St. Louis, Missouri) was quantified by using its extinction coefficient\n\n9.56 mM\" cm\" at 280 nm (Connelly et al., 1990)J To begin the gel retardation assay, purified S15-GFP(S65T)-His, (1 .O pM) was incubated at 20 \"C with varying amounts of S-protein in 10 p L of 10 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.5, containing glycerol (5% v/v). After 20 min, the mixtures were loaded onto a native continuous polyacrylamide (6% w/v) gel (Laemmli, 1970), and the loaded gel was subjected to electrophoresis at 4 \"C at 10 V/cm. Immediately after electrophoresis, the gel was scanned by a Fluorimager SI System (Molecular Dynamics; Sunnyvale, California) using a built-in filter set (490 nm for excitation and 2515 nm for emission). The fluorescence intensities of bound and free S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 were quantified by using the program Image  , 1996). Purified S15-GFP(S65T)-His6 (0.50 nM) was incubated at 20°C (+2 \"C) with various concentrations of S-protein (20 pM--1.0 nM) in 1.0 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 7.5, 8.0, or 8.5, containing NaCl (0 or 0.10 M). Five to seven polarization measurements were made at each S-protein concentration. Values of Kd were determined by using the program DeltaGraph 4.0 (Deltapoint; Monterey, California) to fit the data to the equation:\n\nIn Equation 2, P is the measured polarization, AP (= P, , -P,,,,,,) is the total change in polarization, and F is the concentration of free S-protein. The fraction of bound S-protein ( fB) was obtained from the equation:"
