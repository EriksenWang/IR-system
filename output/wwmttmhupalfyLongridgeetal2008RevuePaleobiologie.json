    "abstract": "The Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI) yield the most diverse middle and late Hettangian ammonite assemblage in British Columbia. In total, 53 ammonite taxa are described of which Paradasyceras carteri, Franziceras kennecottense, Pleuroacanthites charlottensis, Ectocentrites pacificus and Curviceras haidae are new. All the middle and upper Hettangian is present but current collections do not permit the division of the Mulleri and Occidentalis zones or the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones. New occurrences of ammonite taxa are indicated for each zone. The QCI fauna permits correlations with Hettangian and early Sinemurian faunas in other areas of North America, South America, New Zealand, western and eastern Tethys, and northwest Europe. The QCI fauna supports the location of Wrangellia in the northern Hemisphere and the eastern Pacfic during the Hettangian and suggests significant northward displacement for the terrane since that time.",
    "full_text": "The Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI) (Fig. 1) contain the most complete record of Hettangian ammonite faunas in Canada. Preliminary lists of the main taxa present were given by Tipper & CarTer (1990), Tipper & Guex (1994), Tipper et al. (1994) and CarTer et al. (1998). More detailed taxonomic studies were completed by Longridge et al. (2007) on the early Hettangian faunas and by Pálfy (1991) on the uppermost Hettangian faunas of the Rursicostatum Zone [Fig. 2 ; Rursicostatum Subzone of Taylor et al. (2001) ; Longridge et al. (2006)]. The latter study was part of pálfy's unpublished Master's thesis and only a biostratigraphic summary is in print (Pálfy et al., 1994). This study is the first detailed account of the middle and late Hettangian faunas from the QCI. In general, North American Early Jurassic ammonites are of Tethyan affinity or endemic to the eastern Pacific, and for this reason a separate zonation for the Hettangian and Sinemurian of the Western Cordillera of North America has been established by Taylor et al. (2001). However, little Canadian information was included when the zonation was erected. Since then, Longridge et al. (2006) made significant changes to the upper Hettangian and lower Sinemurian zones based on a detailed study of the Badouxia fauna from Taseko Lakes (Fig. 2). Further updating of the zonation was done by Longridge et al. (2008a) based on additional taxonomic studies of the latest Hettangian faunas from Taseko Lakes (Longridge et al., 2008a, b). Details of the diverse ammonite fauna described here will further increase the precision of the North American Zonation for the middle and upper Hettangian (Fig. 2). In the QCI, sections often contain volcanic tuffs interbedded with fossiliferous rock, providing the opportunity to calibrate radiometric dates with the ammonite succession at the zonal level. A tuff bed from the latest Triassic at Kunga Island has already provided a U-Pb date of 199.6±0.3 Ma (Pálfy et al., 2000) which is currently used to approximate the age of the base of the Jurassic (e.g. GradsTein et al., 2004). Work is underway by pálfy and others to date several middle Hettangian tuffs taken from some of the sections discussed below. Consequently, a detailed knowledge of the ammonite successions from the QCI has added importance in order to improve the correlation potential of these dates with sections in other areas. Finally, the QCI fauna can improve Hettangian correlations within North America as well as between North ISSN 0253-6730 America and the rest of the world. Ammonite endemism and provincialism are widespread in the Hettangian making correlation difficult. The QCI fauna helps to address these problems because it contains many taxa with affinities to other areas. This paper highlights correlations between the middle and late Hettangian fauna in the QCI and contemporaneous faunas in other areas of North America, South America, New Zealand, western and eastern Tethys, and northwest Europe.\n\nThe QCI are located on the western margin of the Canadian Cordillera (Fig. 1). The fauna described herein is found within the Sandilands Formation of the Kunga Group. The Sandilands Formation, established by Cam-eron & Tipper (1985) [black limestone member of the Kunga Formation of suTherland Brown (1968)], is several hundred meters thick and ranges in age from early Rhaetian to mostly the latest Sinemurian, although its upper contact is diachronous and locally the unit is as young as earliest Pliensbachian (Tipper & CarTer, 1990 ;Tipper et al., 1991Tipper et al., , 1994 ; ;smiTh & Tipper, 1996). It is typically composed of thinly bedded dark shale and dark grey or blue siltstone. Fine to medium grained sandstone, tuffaceous beds and limestone beds, lenses and concretions are common. Cameron & Tipper (1985) suggested that much of the Sandilands Formation was deposited in a relatively deep back-arc basin somewhat distant from a source of fine volcanic detritus which is present in distal turbidites and less common air-fall tuffs (pálfy et al., 1990 ;Tipper & guex, 1994). However, the precise pa- leogeographic setting of the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic strata of the Wrangellia terrane is poorly constrained at present and more recent work suggests that the Rhaetian-Hettangian parts of the Sandilands Formation were deposited in an outer shelf to upper slope setting (haggarT et al., 2001, 2002). In situ ammonite specimens from the Mulleri to Rursicostatum zones were collected from the nine sections described below.\n\nStratigraphic sections exist in two principal areas (Fig. 1) : Kennecott Point includes sections A to G, yielding middle and late Hettangian ammonites. All sections are exposed at low tide on a wave-cut platform. Section A and the lower portion of section B contain material from the Mulleri and Occidentalis zones. The upper portion of section B contains material from the Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones whereas section C contains material from the Sunrisensis Zone. Section D contains material from the Sunrisensis and Morganense zones and section G contains material from the Sunrisensis and Mineralense zones. Finally, sections E and F contain material from the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones. Figures 34567show details of the stratigraphy and collection localities for Fig. 3: Lithostratigraphy and fossil localities of Section A at Kennecott Point, Queen Charlotte Islands.  each section. The lower portion of section KPB described by CarTer et al. (1998) is a composite section including sections A, B, D and E. The lower portion of section D of pálfy et al. (1994) is equivalent to section E of the current paper. The lower part of section F and all of section G of pálfy et al. (1994) are equivalent to our sections F and G, respectively. Sections H and I are exposed in the supratidal region on the southern side of Kunga Island where beds are steeply dipping to nearly vertical. Both sections contain material from the Mulleri and Occidentalis to Coronoides zones.\n\nFigure 7 shows details of the stratigraphy and collection localities for each section. Section H begins near the top of section III of longridge et al. (2007) (ammonite level A7 of section III is equivalent to H* in section H) and is equivalent to the upper portion of section SKUD described by Tipper et al. (1994) and CarTer et al. (1998).\n\nSection I is equivalent to the upper portion of section SKUE (Tipper et al., 1994 ;CarTer et al., 1998). Another section on the north side of Kunga Island contains very poorly preserved late Hettangian material (lower portion of KUD in CarTer et al., 1998). Collections from this section are not included herein as the poor preservation does not permit identification.\n\nFigure 8 shows approximate correlations between sections A-I. Detailed data for sections A-I, including a brief geographical description of each site, latitude and longitude as well as Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) numbers for each location is shown in Appendix A.\n\nAlthough a few beds yield some better preserved, threedimensional material, the common mode of preservation of ammonites in the Sandilands Formation is flattened internal moulds resulting in significant information loss, especially for ventral features and whorl section. The extensive use of open nomenclature is therefore inevitable.\n\nOpen nomenclature follows BengTson (1988). Figure 9 shows the ranges of ammonite taxa found within the Mulleri and Occidentalis to Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones in the QCI.\n\nAbbreviations and measurements follow smiTh (1986) and include maximum shell diameter (DMAX), shell diameter (D), umbilical diameter (UD), whorl width (WW), whorl height (WH), umbilical diameter as a ratio of shell diameter (U), ratio of the whorl width to the whorl height (WWWH) and primary ribs per half whorl (PRHW). Graphical plots of several of these parameters are shown below and include all measurable specimens of each species collected. A record of the exact measurements of each specimen is shown in Appendix B. All measured and figured specimens are deposited in the type collection of the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa.\n\nFamily Phylloceratidae Zittel, 1884 Genus Phylloceras SueSS, 1865 Type species : Ammonites heterophyllus sowerBy, 1820. Material and measurements : Two well preserved, three-dimensional measured specimens (GSC 129066-129067) and one incomplete specimen. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11A. Description : Compressed form, evolute for genus. Whorl cross-section high oval. Umbilical wall one short arch. Flanks weakly convex with greatest width midflank. Venter broad and smooth. Flanks smooth aside from weak, prorsiradiate growth lines. Septal suture line with triphyllic first and second lateral saddles and spatular folioles (Fig. 10A). Discussion : Phylloceras asperaense from the QCI is  inner whorls, umbilical wall upright, umbilical shoulder distinct but rounded. Whorl cross-section subelliptical. Flanks parallel to weakly trapezoidal. Widest point of whorl upper flank. Venter broad and rounded. Flanks smooth except straight to weakly sigmoid prorsiradiate growth lines visible on best-preserved material. Body chamber whorl cross-section compressed. Strong rectiradiate to prorsiradiate flank ribs weakest on lower flank, strongest on upper flank. Strong ribs continue across venter forming forward-directed chevron. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Paradasyceras carteri has significantly more involute inner whorls than other species of Paradasyceras and lacks the sharp umbilical angle that helps characterize the type species. It is referred to Paradasyceras principally because of similarities in body chamber ornament to P. bonifacii (wähner) and P. bonifaciformis guex and also resembles established species of the genus in whorl cross-section. The inner whorls of P. carteri resemble some species of Phylloceras at similar shell diameters but differ in having parallel flanks and a more upright umbilical wall. The inner whorls of P. carteri are difficult to distinguish from poorly preserved Fergusonites striatus that lack ornament. The former usually have flatter flanks, lack constrictions and are more involute by 30 mm shell diameter. Stratigraphic position : Sections A and B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones.

Fergusonites cf. striatus guex.-hilleBrandT, p. 140, pl. 1, figs 2-3 ; text-fig. 27a-b. Material and measurements : Twelve measured (GSC 129081-129092) and eight incomplete specimens and fragments. Preservation varies from moderate to very good with many three-dimensional specimens. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11A. Description : Moderately involute. Compressed with suboval whorl cross-section. Umbilical wall and shoulder rounded. Flanks weakly convex with widest point of whorl mid to upper flank. Venter broad and rounded. Fine, regularly spaced ribs prorsiradiate on flanks becoming rectiradiate on upper flank and across venter. Ribs weakest on lower flank, strongest on upper flank and across venter. Ribs regular in strength except in two specimens (GSC 129082, Pl. I, figs 6-8 ; GSC 129091, not figured) where rib strength varies somewhat. Fine ribs visible on internal mould but usually stronger on shell (e.g. GSC 129081, Pl. I, fig. 21).

Constrictions hook back on umbilical shoulder then follow trajectory of ribbing. Suture line not available. Discussion : As discussed by hilleBrandT (2000a), confident assignment of the South American examples at the species level is precluded because the constriction that marks the aperture of F. striatus cannot be verified. Stratigraphic position : Sections A and B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Genus Nevadaphyllites Guex, 1980 Type species : Nevadaphyllites compressus guex, 1980.

Nevadaphyllites psilomorphus (neumayr).-longridge et al., pl. 1, figs 1-2, 5-6. Material and measurements : Six measured specimens (GSC 129093-129098) and many flattened specimens or fragments. Preservation varies from moderate to very good with several three-dimensional specimens. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11B. Description : Midvolute and compressed for genus. Umbilical wall one short arch. Widest point of whorl near umbilicus, flanks subparallel, sloping gently toward narrow but rounded venter. Best preserved specimen shows weak, prorsiradiate, sigmoid striae on flanks (Pl. I, figs 17-18). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Nevadaphyllites psilomorphus from the QCI has very similar volution to the specimens figured by neumayr (1879) and lange (1952). rakús (1993a) differentiates N. glaberrimus (neumayr) from N. psilomorphus principally based on a difference in the shape of the umbilical wall. He claims that the former species has an umbilical wall that is one short arch whereas the latter species has an umbilical wall that is straighter with a more distinct umbilical shoulder (as illustrated in lange, 1952, text-fig. 1.1). The QCI material has a short, convex umbilical wall. Nevertheless, we have placed the QCI material in N. psilomorphus because we feel the lectotype of the species (neumayr, 1879, pl. 2, fig. 4) also has a convex umbilical wall.\n\nNevadaphyllites psilomorphus from the QCI is slightly more evolute than the Taseko Lakes material (longridge et al., 2008a) and the more depressed material from Salzburg (Böhm et al., 1999) and Nevada (guex, 1995). Due to poor preservation, the specimens of dommergues et al. (1995) and sTevens (2004) are attributed with uncertainty to N. psilomorphus. The QCI form is significantly more compressed than the more evolute Phylloceras asperaense hilleBrandT and the more involute P. chilense hilleBrandT. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones ; section B, Mulleri/Occidentalis to Sunrisensis zones. Nevadaphyllites aff. compressus GUEX, 1980 Pl. I, figs 12-14 v? 1967.

Nevadaphyllites aff. compressus guex.-longridge et al., pl. 1, figs 28-29. Material and measurements : One measured specimen (GSC 129099) and one fragment (GSC 129100). Measurement of volution is presented in Figure 11B. Description : Compressed and midvolute for genus. Umbilical wall upright with rounded umbilical shoulder. Flanks subparallel, tapering slightly toward relatively narrow but rounded venter. Upper flank and venter with weak undulations in well preserved areas of body chamber. At adoral end of specimen, a sigmoid constriction occurs on internal mould that has its greatest inflection midflank and projects forward across venter. Constriction absent on external shell. Discussion : Nevadaphyllites aff. compressus is most similar to N. compressus guex but differs in having a lower, gently arched umbilical wall. It differs from N. aff. compressus from Taseko Lakes in bearing ventral undulations on the body chamber (longridge et al., 2008a). Due to poor preservation, it is not possible to identify this form with confidence. Nevadaphyllites aff. compressus may represent a new species but our limited, poorly preserved material does not warrant a new species designation at this time. Nevadaphyllites aff. compressus has similar volution to Nevadaphyllites (?) sp. from the lower Hettangian beds in the QCI (longridge et al., 2007). Poor preservation hinders confident comparison ; however, the early Hettangian form can attain much larger shell diameters. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Nevadaphyllites sp. Pl. I, fig. 16 Material and measurements : One flattened, measured specimen (GSC 129101). Preservation poor. Measurement of volution is presented in Figure 11B. Description : Midvolute form for genus. Flanks with fine striae strongest on upper flank. Adoral end of specimen with sigmoid constriction. Discussion : The volution of Nevadaphyllites sp. is similar to N. psilomorphus. It differs in having striae on the flanks, a constriction at the adoral end of the specimen and in reaching maturity at much smaller shell diameters. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Genus Togaticeras rAkúS, 1993a Type species : Phylloceras togatum (neumayr, 1879). Togaticeras togatum neumAyr, 1879 Pl.

Togaticeras togatum (neumayr).-longridge et al., pl. 1, figs 21-22. Material and measurements : Eleven measured specimens (GSC 129104-129114) and many poorly preserved or incomplete specimens and fragments (GSC 129103). All three-dimensional specimens have a shell diameter under 20 mm ; larger specimens flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11B. Description : Compressed, midvolute to involute form. Suboval whorl cross-section. Umbilical wall one short arch. Umbilical shoulder distinct but rounded. Flanks weakly convex. Venter broad and rounded. Flanks and venter smooth aside from distinct, strongly prorsiradiate constrictions present on internal mould. Constrictions sigmoid on flanks, projecting forward across venter. Six to seven constrictions per whorl at shell diameters of 20 mm. At shell diameters c. 30 mm up to 11 constrictions on outer whorl. A partial suture line is preserved on one specimen (GSC 129108). The second lateral saddle is diphyllic and moderately strongly incised. Discussion : Togaticeras togatum from the QCI includes specimens that are more strongly involute than previously recognized (Pl. I, fig. 1). It is possible that these forms are a new species ; however, as there is no difference in the stratigraphic range of the more evolute and involute specimens, we feel this difference is most likely due to variation within T. togatum. The portion of suture line preserved on GSC 129108 is very similar to the equivalent part of the suture of the lectotype figured by rakús (1993a, text-fig. 15).

Ectocentrites pacificus n. sp. Pl. II, figs 2, 7, 14 Material and measurements : Nine measured specimens (GSC 129117, 129119-129126) and many incomplete specimens and fragments (GSC 129116, 129118). All material flattened. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 11C-D. Holotype GSC 129117 (Pl.

Paratypes GSC 129116, 129118, 129119-129126 from the Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones, Kennecott Point, sections B-D, QCI. Derivation of name : Named for the location in the eastern Pacific. Diagnosis : Involute form. No constrictions. Sigmoid flank ribs project forward on upper flank. Ribs bear ventrolateral tubercles. Ribs irregularly spaced. Ribs on outer whorls may continue strongly across venter. Description : Involute form for genus. No constrictions. Sigmoid flank ribs rursiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate, projecting forward on upper flank. Ribs begin on lower flank, coarsen upflank and bear ventrolateral tubercles. Ribs on innermost whorls somewhat variable in strength. Ribs on intermediate and outer whorls irregularly spaced. Preservation limited but ribs on intermediate whorls may weaken on venter while on outer whorls ribs continue strongly across venter (Pl. II, fig. 14). Discussion : Ectocentrites pacificus differs from the majority of the type material of E. petersi (hauer) in lacking constrictions on the inner whorls and is more involute at equivalent shell diameters. meisTer et al. (2000, p. 85) discuss differences between E. cf. petersi from South America and E. petersi. These include the early appearance of ribs on the inner whorls and the presence of a ventral depression caused by weak ribbing between ventrolateral tubercles. As far as preservation permits analysis, these differences are also present in E. pacificus from the QCI.\n\nEctocentrites pacificus is very similar in volution and or-nament to E. cf. petersi from South America (hille-BrandT 1981, pl. 1, fig. 6 ;2000d, pl. 12, fig. 9). hille-BrandT (2000d, p. 86) mentions that the depth of rib interspaces on the innermost whorls are different on the South American specimen and this gives the impression of constrictions. Although some discrepancy in rib interspace depth is also visible in some of the QCI specimens, the specimens do not have constrictions. The quality of preservation in the QCI material as well as the limited quantity of South American material means it is not possible to be certain if this is a significant difference.\n\nStratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones ; sections C and D, Sunrisensis Zone.

Material and measurements : One measured specimen (GSC 129137), two measured external moulds (GSC 129138-129139) and ten incomplete specimens and fragments (GSC 129136, 129141). Material is partially to completely flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11E. Description : Inner whorls moderately evolute to moderately involute. Midvolute at larger shell diameters. Crosssection in better preserved fragment has convex flanks with flattened ventral area that projects into a slight median protuberance at midline. Parabolic ribs strongly rursiradiate on lower and middle flanks, projecting sharply forward on ventrolateral shoulder. Rib strength and spacing variable in some specimens, more regular in others. Ribs weakest on lower flanks developing greater strength upflank where they can be very strong. Ribs often asymmetric with steep adapical and gentler adoral slopes. Weaker ribs continue toward midline of venter. On largest specimen (Pl. II, fig. 17) ribs on last whorl weaken on upper flank. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Similar to P. biformis from the Austrian Alps and Italy, P. cf. biformis from the QCI varies considerably in volution on the inner whorls. Paracaloceras cf. biformis is comparable to P. biformis from Nevada (guex 1995, pl. 23, figs 5-6) but differs from P. aff. biformis (guex 1995, pl. 24, figs 13-14) in having more widely spaced ribs that are less coarse at similar shell diameters. The small size of P. aff. biformis from Tibet (yin et al., 2007, text-figs 5E-G, 6) precludes close comparison with the QCI form although the general ribbing style is similar. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones ; section B, Coronoides to Pleuroacanthitoides zones. Pleuroacanthites charlottensis n. sp. Pl. II, figs 3, 6 Material and measurements : Five measured specimens (GSC 129143-129147) and two incomplete specimens (GSC 129142). Smaller material partially three-dimensional ; larger material flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11E. Holotype GSC 129142 (Pl. II, fig. 3) from the Coronoides Zone, Kennecott Point, section B, level 10, QCI. Paratypes GSC 129143-129147 from the Mulleri/Occidentalis to Coronoides, Kennecott Point, sections A and B, QCI. Derivation of name : Named for the Queen Charlotte Islands where the type material was collected. Diagnosis : Evolute for genus. Whorl cross-section compressed. Inner whorls with rursiradiate parabolic ribs with steep adapical and gentler adoral slopes. Intermediate whorls with weak rectiradiate ribs. Outer whorl smooth. Description : Evolute on inner whorls ; midvolute on outer whorls. Whorl cross-section compressed by 25 mm shell diameter. Inner whorls with asymmetric, moderate to strongly rursiradiate parabolic ribs with steep adapical and gentler adoral slopes. Rib strength variable, often having greatest strength at top of flanks. Beyond shell diameters of 20-25 mm, very weak rectiradiate ribs are more closely spaced. Occasional strong, rursiradiate ribs still present on flanks (Pl. II, fig. 3). Outer whorl of largest specimen smooth (Pl. II, fig. 3). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Pleuroacanthites charlottensis is most similar to P. biformis evolutus lange (1952, pl. 11, fig. 4). However, the QCI form is more evolute at similar shell diameters and also lacks a keel. Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare the two forms at larger size as the Alpine form of lange (1952, p. 93) is a microconch. The ornament is too regular in spacing and orientation in the specimens figured by wähner (1894, pl. 5, figs 3, 8) that lange also attributes to his new subspecies. Additionally, figure 3 is too depressed. Volution and cross-section of the inner and intermediate whorls of P. charlottensis are similar to P. polycyclus wähner. The QCI form differs in having more crowded, irregularly orientated ornament on the inner whorls and in being considerably more involute at large shell diameters. Pleuroacanthites charlotten-sis is more evolute and compressed on the inner whorls than P. polycycloides wähner. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones ; section B, Coronoides Zone. Pleuroacanthites sp. Pl. II, fig. 10 Material and measurements : One partially flattened specimen (GSC 129148). Measurement of volution is presented in Figure 11E. Description : Midvolute for genus. Inner whorls not preserved. On inner half of outer whorl, evenly spaced, swollen ribs resemble nodes on flanks. On outer half of outer whorl, broad, weakly prorsiradiate to concave ribs on flanks. Growth lines or weaker ribs following same trajectory visible between some ribs. Suture line not available. Discussion : The poor preservation of this specimen does not permit confident identification. However, this specimen probably represents a new species because it differs from all other currently recognized Pleuroacanthites in ribbing style. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Genus Eolytoceras Frebold, 1967 Type species : Eolytoceras tasekoi freBold, 1967. Eolytoceras cf. praecursor Guex, 1995 Pl. II, figs 1, 4, 8, 15-16 ; Fig. 11C Material and measurements : Nine measured specimens (GSC 129127-129129, 129130-129135) and many incomplete specimens (GSC 129140). Some uncompressed material. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11C. Description : Inner whorls evolute for genus. Depressed on inner whorls (Pl. II, figs 15-16) becoming weakly compressed at medium shell diameters. Nucleus nodose (Pl. II, figs 4, 8). After this, moderately to strongly swollen ribs irregular in spacing and strength, often beginning midflank with greatest strength on upper flank. Beyond shell diameters of 25-30 mm, prorsiradiate to concave ribbing weak and closely spaced. Some specimens maintain this flank ribbing to end of preserved shell. Others become smooth. In some specimens, periodic undulations occur on flanks (Pl. II, fig. 1). At shell diameters of c. 50 mm, specimens diverge into two groups. One group evolute to end of preserved shell (Pl. II, figs 1, 4). Other group becomes more involute (Pl. II, fig. 8). Last 1/3 whorl of GSC 129127 (Pl. II, fig. 1) not chambered. Suture line too incomplete to illustrate. Saddles with spatular folioles, umbilical lobes retracted. Discussion : Some specimens of Eolytoceras cf. praecursor are very similar to E. praecursor from Nevada (e.g. Pl. II, fig. 1). However, this species is represented only by the holotype and it is currently not possible to ascertain the variability of the species. Some of the QCI specimens become more involute at larger shell diameters and have swollen ribs that continue to larger shell diameters than the holotype. Therefore the QCI material is placed with uncertainty to E. praecursor. It is possible that E. cf. praecursor is a sexually dimorphic species. The inner whorls are very similar yet differences in volution beyond shell diameters of c. 50 mm make it possible to divide the material into two groups. One group is consistently evolute (Pl. II, figs 1, 4) whereas the other is involute (Pl. II, fig. 8). One specimen may be a microconch as approximately the last one third of the outer whorl is body chamber (Pl. II, fig. 1). Unfortunately, the suture lines are mostly obscured and are not preserved in the rest of the larger material, so it is not possible to see approximation. Due to poor preservation, other signs of maturity such as the presence of a rostrum and egression cannot be confirmed. Potential microconch or macroconch status is indicated in the plate caption where possible. As discussed by guex (1995) for the Nevada specimen, the juvenile whorls of Eolytoceras cf. praecursor resemble Pleuroacanthites mulleri. Some of this material closely resembles the holotype of Transipsiloceras transiens guex (1980, pl. 2, fig. 3 ; 1995, pl. 5, fig. 3-4) from the early Hettangian, but differs in being consistently more evolute on the inner and intermediate whorls (e.g. Pl. II, fig. 1). Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides to Pleuroacanthitoides zones ; Section H, Coronoides Zone. Eolytoceras cf. tasekoi Frebold, 1967 Pl. I, figs 19, 22 cf. 1967.

Material and measurements : Six measured specimens (GSC 107365, 107367, 129150-129153) and many incomplete specimens (GSC 129149). All except one specimen flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11C. Description : Moderately evolute. Whorl cross-section ellipsoid, compressed, flanks slightly convex. Some specimens with weak prorsiradiate ribbing on inner whorls and occasional faint ribs on intermediate whorls. Rare specimens with occasional weak, slightly prorsiradiate constrictions. The New Zealand material (sTevens, 2004) is very poorly preserved and cannot be identified with confidence even at the generic level. Stratigraphic position : Section D, Morganense Zone ; section G, Mineralense Zone ; sections E and F, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones. Also occurs in the Columbiae Zone in the QCI. Eolytoceras aff. constrictum lonGridGe, SmitH & tipper, 2008a Pl. III, figs 1, 9 aff. 2008a. Eolytoceras constrictum longridge et al., pl. 1, figs 3-4, 24-25 ; text-figs 9N, 10D. Material and measurements : Two measured specimens (GSC 107373-107374). Material partially compressed. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11C. Description : Evolute form. Flanks convex. Innermost whorls smooth. Adorally, slightly convex flares develop from an early stage (6-7 flares/half whorl at D > 25 mm). At later growth stages, ventrolateral nodes develop on flares. Flares may be accompanied by a flanking constriction. Some specimens with fine growth lines. Discussion : Eolytoceras aff. constrictum is very similar on the inner whorls to E. constrictum from Taseko Lakes although it attains much larger shell diameters. Additionally, in the Taseko Lakes material the flares are always preceded by a constriction (longridge et al., 2008a). It is unclear whether these represent species level differences or simply variations within a single species. Eolytoceras aff. constrictum differs from other species of Eolytoceras in having prominent flares. It is similar to several specimens of Analytoceras articulatum (sower-By) figured by wähner (1894, pl. 54, fig. 3 ; pl. 58, figs 1-3) in having flares and nodes on the outer whorls but differs in lacking articulated inner whorls. Stratigraphic position : Sections E and F, Mineralense/ Rursicostatum zones. Also occurs in the Columbiae Zone in the QCI. Pleuroacanthitidae gen. indet. n. sp. Pl. II, fig. 5 Material : One somewhat distorted and flattened, moderately preserved specimen (GSC 129115). Description : Evolute form for genus (UD/D = c. 48%). No constrictions visible. Flank ribs rursiradiate, projecting forward on upper flank. Inner whorls with weakly swollen, regularly spaced ribs. Some ribs show weak tubercles. Beyond shell diameter of c. 20 mm, flank ribs more crowded and irregular in spacing and strength. Small ventrolateral swellings visible on some ribs. Ribs continue onto venter. Discussion : Pleuroacanthitidae gen. indet. n. sp. shares many similarities in ornament to the Pleuroacanthitidae and may be an intermediate form between the Pleuroacanthites with its rursiradiate and swollen ribs on the inner whorls and Ectocentrites with its finer, tuberculate ribs. The QCI form differs from species of Tayloricites guex in lacking constrictions and ventrolateral nodes on the inner whorls. It is similar in volution and ribbing density to E. dommerguesi meisTer et al., but differs in having much weaker ribbing that is rursiradiate rather than prorsiradiate. It is similar in ribbing density and strength to E. italicus meneghini but is more evolute, lacks constrictions and has ribs that are rursiradiate rather than weakly prorsiradiate.

Material and measurements : Eight measured specimens (GSC 129154-129161) and several incomplete specimens or fragments. Most specimens three-dimensional ; preservation moderate to good. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 11E. Description : Evolute form. Nucleus poorly preserved. Inner whorls depressed with weak, prorsiradiate flank ribs to c. 20 mm shell diameter (Pl. III, fig. 2). At shell diameters over 20 mm, whorls become compressed (Pl. III, figs 3-4) with weakly convex flanks and a broad, smooth venter. Beyond shell diameters of 20 mm, flanks vary from smooth to bearing irregular ribs of variable strength and orientation (Pl. III, figs 10-11). Two specimens show faint, straight to weakly concave growth lines on the flanks that project forward on venter (GSC 129159). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : As discussed by guex (1995), it is not possible to see the ornament on the type material of E. occidentalis at shell diameters of less than 15 mm. The material from the QCI confirms that this species does not bear constrictions on the innermost whorls. Differences between E. occidentalis and other species of Euphyllites are given in guex (1995). Euphyllites occidentalis from the QCI differ from species of Discamphiceras in being consistently more depressed. Stratigraphic position : Sections A and B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Genus Caloceras HyAtt, 1871 Type species : Ammonites torus D'Orbigny, 1844. Caloceras aff. bloomfieldense donovAn, 1956 Pl. IV, fig. 1 aff. 1952.

Material and measurements : One flattened measured specimen (GSC 129162). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 12A-B. Description : Evolute form. Nucleus poorly preserved. Straight, sharp, crowded flank ribs weakly to moderately rursiradiate. Ribs fade on upper flank. Discussion : Caloceras aff. bloomfieldense differs from C. bloomfieldense in having a slightly lower number of ribs on the innermost whorls and a higher number of ribs on the intermediate whorls. It also has flank ribs that are rursiradiate throughout ontogeny. Caloceras bloomfieldense was originally described by donovan (1952) under the name C. multicostatum. The QCI form is similar to some specimens of C. pirondi (reynès) (e.g. guerin-franiaTTe, 1990, pl. 2, fig. 3) but differs in having flank ribs that are rursiradiate rather than rectiradiate to prorsiradiate.

Discamphiceras silberlingi guex.-longridge et al., pl. 2, figs 17-18, 20. Material and measurements : Twenty-four measured specimens (GSC 129163-129180, 130669-130674) and many incomplete specimens and fragments. Material reasonably well preserved ; some three-dimensional specimens. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 12C, E. Description : Strongly compressed, moderately evolute to moderately involute form with subelliptical whorl cross-section. Inner whorls with low yet upright umbilical wall. Umbilical shoulder rounded. Nearly flat flanks taper gently toward broad venter. Specimens where nucleus well preserved ornamented with nodes to shell diameters of 3.5 to 5 mm. Beyond this, ribs rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate. By shell diameters of 15 mm, gently flexuous, prorsiradiate ribs vary considerably in strength. Narrow ribs begin on lowest flank, widening and having greatest strength midflank before fading on upper flank. In well-preserved material, ribs project forward, sometimes dividing into two ribs, before crossing venter in a forward-directed chevron. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Some of the material from Alaska (imlay, 1981; pálfy et al., 1999) is marked with a question mark in the synonymy list due to poor preservation which hampers certainty of identification. The material identified by yin & enay (2000) as D. cf. silberlingi was recently reclassified as D. pleuronotum (yin et al., 2007). Some New Zealand specimens figured as Waehneroceras otapiriense sTevens (2004, pl. 2, figs 4-9, 11-13) are very similar in volution and ribbing style to D. silberlingi ; however, this species differs in being much less compressed (sTevens, 2004, text-fig. 13). Discamphiceras silberlingi is closely related to the South American forms D. reissi (Tilmann) and D. cf. calcimontanum (wähner) of hilleBrandT (2000c).

Material and measurements : Three measured specimens (GSC 130677-130679), one measured external cast (GSC 130680), two incomplete specimens and two external casts (GSC 130676). Preservation moderate. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 12D-E. Description : Compressed form, evolute for genus. Nucleus nodose. Slightly sloping umbilical wall that becomes higher with increasing shell diameter. Umbilical shoulder gently rounded. Rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate ribs begin on umbilical wall or lowest flank having greatest strength midflank before fading on upper flank. One specimen with better preserved venter shows weak ribs dividing into two on uppermost flank and projecting forward across venter. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Although incomplete preservation of whorl cross-section and lack of a suture line hinders confident comparison, the QCI form is very similar to some specimens of D. cf. pleuronotum of hilleBrandT (2000c, pl. 2, figs 6, 9, 12). The eastern Pacific form closely resembles D. pleuronotum (Canavari) in volution, whorl cross-section and rib number but differs in having flank ribs that are rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate rather than weakly rursiradiate. Furthermore, as discussed by hilleBrandT (2000c, p. 8), D. pleuronotum has a much more strongly incised suture line with deeper lateral and umbilical lobes (Canavari, 1882, pl. 19, fig. 2c) than D. cf. pleuronotum from South America. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones ; section B, Coronoides Zone. Discamphiceras cf. submesogenos Guex, 1995 Pl. IV, fig. 8 cf. 1995. Discamphiceras submesogenos guex, p. 29, pl. 11, figs 3-4, 7-8, pl. 13, figs 5-12, pl. 14, figs 3-4. Material and measurements : Fourteen measured (GSC 130681-130694) and many incomplete specimens. All material flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 12D. Description : Involute for genus. Nucleus nodose. Following this, weak, prorsiradiate growth lines project forward on lower flank, rectiradiate on upper flank (GSC 130690, not figured). Intermittent weak ribs that follow trajectory of growth lines present in some specimens. On two specimens, ribs project forward onto venter in a forwardly directed chevron (Pl. IV, fig. 8). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Although the QCI material can be slightly more involute and two specimens bear ventral ribbing that is more pronounced than the type material of D. submesogenos, it is very similar in other respects. Discamphiceras cf. submesogenos is most similar to D. mesogenos (wähner) but differs in being more involute and in having intermittent ribbing on the flanks and venter.

Material and measurements : Three measured specimens (GSC 130696-130698), seven incomplete specimens (GSC 130695) and three external casts. All material at least partially flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 12D. Description : Involute for genus. Preserved relief in two specimens suggests whorl cross-section strongly compressed. Nucleus nodose. Following this, weak, prorsiradiate ribs sigmoidal on flanks. Ribs project forward on lower flank and backward on upper flank. Preservation of outer whorls poor, but specimens appear to smooth out somewhat on flanks. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Discamphiceras aff. antiquum from the QCI is very similar to D. cf. antiquum from South America (hilleBrandT, 2000a, c) and Discamphiceras aff. reissi from Nevada (guex, 1995) in volution and ornament. Incomplete preservation of whorl cross-section and lack of a suture line hinders confident assignment. Discamphiceras aff. antiquum from the QCI predominantly differs from the more evolute D. antiquum from Nevada (guex, 1980, 1995) in possessing more distinct ribs on the flanks, especially at small shell diameters.

Material and measurements : Two measured specimens (GSC 130699, 130701), one measured external cast (GSC 130700) and two incomplete specimens. Material partially flattened. Measurements of volution and rib density are presented in Figure 12A-B. Description : Evolute form. Nodose nucleus. Beyond this, moderately strong flank ribs weakly rursiradiate to rectiradiate. Weakened ribs project forward on uppermost flank onto venter. One specimen has ribs that bend forward midflank becoming prorsiradiate. Venter poorly preserved. However, one fragment is smooth at whorl height of 4 mm while in another specimen, a keel is suggested at a whorl height of 6 mm (Pl. VII, fig. 7). Suture line and cross-section not preserved. Discussion : The similarity of A. liasicus to Gyrophioceras morganense was discussed by Taylor (1998, p. 491) when he erected the new species and again by hil-leBrandT (2000d, p. 76) with specific reference to the South American specimen of A. cf. liasicus. The QCI material is especially similar to the paratype of G. morganense (Taylor, 1998, fig. 21.11-21.12) but differs from the slightly more involute species in having less strongly rursiradiate ribs at the base of the flanks. As discussed by rakús (1993b), the material from the West Carpathians has much sparser flank ribbing than other A. liasicus. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides Zone.

Arietites (Alsatites) proaries neumayr.-Blind, p. 100, pl. 3, fig. 6. Material and measurements : Eight measured (GSC 130703-130710) and many incomplete specimens (GSC 156959). All material flattened. Measurements of volution and rib density are presented in Figure 12A-B. Description : Evolute form. Ribs on innermost whorls weakly rursiradiate to rectiradiate. At shell diameters greater than 10 mm, ribs regularly spaced, more or less concave and crowded. Beyond shell diameters of 40-60 mm, concave ribbing becomes less crowded and can be irregular in spacing and strength (Pl. VII, fig. 8). At large shell diameters ribbing strongly concave (Pl. VII, fig. 10). Suture line and cross-section not preserved. Discussion : Alsatites cf. proaries is very similar in volution and ribbing style to A. proaries although the QCI form can also have ribs that are less crowded and more irregularly spaced at larger shell diameters (Pl. VII, fig. 8). Alsatites cf. proaries is somewhat similar in ribbing style to Laqueoceras cf. sublaqueus (wähner) from South America (hilleBrandT, 2000d, pl. 3, figs 8-9) but is more evolute at large shell diameters and has ribs that are more consistently concave on the flanks. Alsatites cf. proaries is similar in volution and ribbing style to Paracaloceras haueri (gümBel) but lacks evidence of a keel. Alsatites ex gr. proaries of guex (1995) is much more involute than the QCI material. Alsatites cf. proaries is similar to the paratype of Gyrophioceras morganense (Taylor, 1998, fig. 21.11-21.12) and some specimens of A. liasicus. It differs in being more involute and in having denser ribbing on the inner whorls.

All material partially or completely flattened. Measurements of volution and rib density are presented in Figure 12A-B. Description : Midvolute form for genus. Ribbing on inner whorls variable in strength and spacing. Specimens divide into two groups beyond shell diameters of 30 mm. In one group, weak, crowded flank ribs are prorsiradiate to weakly concave (Pl. VII, fig. 5). In other group, concave flank ribs remain stronger and more widely spaced (Pl. VII, fig. 6). Suture line and cross-section not available although preserved relief suggests venter was smooth to maximum preserved shell diameter (D = c. 48 mm). Discussion : Alsatites ex gr. proaries from the QCI is moderately to strongly more involute and has stronger ribs on the inner whorls than most A. proaries. Alsatites ex gr. proaries from the QCI has similar morphological variability as A. ex gr. proaries in Nevada (guex, 1995). The ribbing style is similar to some specimens of\n\nA. bipartitus (Laqueoceras bipartitum of hilleBrandT 2000d, pl. 1).

Material and measurements : Seven measured (GSC 130718-130724) and one incomplete specimen. Material partially to completely flattened. Measurements of volution and rib number are presented in Figure 12A-B. Description : Evolute form. Preserved relief suggests cross-section of inner whorls subrounded. Nucleus nodose. Flank ribs more or less irregular in spacing and strength. Ribbing on inner whorls weakly concave to straight. Ribbing on outer whorls concave. Ribs bend forward and continue on ventrolateral shoulder. Venter not preserved. Discussion : Mullerites cf. pleuroacanthitoides may be slightly more evolute on the inner whorls than M. pleuroacanthitoides from Nevada. Some specimens of the QCI form resemble A. nigromontanus (gümBel). They differ on the inner whorls in having ribs that are less strongly rursiradiate and on the outer whorls in being more evolute and in having ribs that are less crowded.

Sunrisites cf. chilensis HillebrAndt, 2000c Pl. VI, figs 10, 14-16 cf. 2000c. Sunrisites chilensis hilleBrandT, p. 38, pl. 10, fig. 1, pl. 11, figs 1-4, pl. 12, figs 1-2 ; text-fig. 5. Material and measurements : Eight measured specimens (GSC 130727-130734) and many incomplete specimens and fragments (GSC 130725-130726). Preservation varies from moderate to poor with one partial threedimensional specimen. Measurements of volution and number of ribs are presented in Figure 13A-B. Description : Evolute on inner whorls, moderately involute on outer whorls. Preserved relief suggests cross-section of intermediate whorls rounded ; cross-section of outer whorls high oval with rounded venter. Widest point of whorl low midflank. Umbilical wall upright, umbilical shoulder rounded. In some specimens ribbing on innermost whorls irregularly spaced. In others ribs regularly spaced from nucleus. Beyond shell diameters of c. 15 mm, strong, rectiradiate to weakly concave flank ribs regularly spaced in all specimens. Above shell diameters of c. 75 mm, ribbing becomes weakly prorsiradiate and irregular in spacing and strength. In one specimen, ribs bifurcate on upper flank projecting forward onto venter as weak, forwardly inclined striae. One specimen showing complex, strongly retracted umbilical lobes (Pl. VI, fig. 16). At large shell diameters bullae are present on the lower flank (Pl. VI, fig. 15). Discussion : Volution and ribbing on the inner whorls of S. cf. chilensis are very similar to S. hadroptychus (wähner). The QCI form differs in having ribs that are irregular and much weaker at large shell diameters. Some S. cf. chilensis resemble Alsatites nigromontanus of guex (1995) on the inner whorls but differ in lacking ribs on the umbilical wall and in having ribs that are less concave at similar shell diameters. Sunrisites cf. chilensis is more involute than S. brimblecombei at large shell diameters and differs from S. chilcotinensis in having a lower number of ribs that are never nodal on the inner whorls.

Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 13A-B. Description : Moderately involute for genus. Rectiradiate ribs blunt, coarse, and widely spaced (8-9 ribs per half whorl) with high rounded profile. Ribs show greatest height midflank. Discussion : The inner and intermediate whorls of this species differ from all other Sunrisites species in having much coarser and more widely spaced ribs. Stratigraphic position : Section F, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones. Genus Badouxia Guex & tAylor, 1976 Type species : Psiloceras canadense freBold, 1951. nomic studies of Badouxia assemblages from other areas of North America have occurred. A study by longridge et al. (2006) resulted in the elimination of two previously recognized species, Badouxia occidentalis (freBold) and B. oregonensis Taylor, which were placed in synonymy with B. canadensis (freBold). Only the latter taxonomic changes are reflected herein. Stratigraphic position : Section G, Mineralense Zone ; sections E and F, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones.

Material : Twelve flattened specimens and fragments (GSC 130735-130736). Description : Involute form for genus. Crowded flank ribs strongly concave on flanks. Keel suggested by c. 18 mm shell diameter. Suture line and cross-section not preserved. Discussion : Measurements were not taken on the QCI material due to inconsistent preservation of the keel that would produce inaccurate measurements of shell diameter.

Measurements of volution and number of ribs are presented in Figure 13A-B. Description : Moderately evolute for genus. Moderately crowded flank ribs concave on flanks. No definitive keel by shell diameters of c. 27 mm. Suture line and cross-section not preserved. Discussion : Pseudaetomoceras cf. doetzkirchneri may have a slightly lower number of ribs on the inner whorls than P. doetzkirchneri. The specimen of hall & piTaru (2004, pl. 2, fig. 2) is marked with a question mark in the synonym list as it has sigmoid flank ribs. This character is not as apparent in other P. doetzkirchneri. Stratigraphic position : Sections B and C, Sunrisensis Zone. Family Schlotheimiidae SpAtH, 1923b Genus Storthoceras lAnGe, 1941 Type species : Aegoceras extracostatum wähner, 1882. The Storthoceras from the QCI are assigned to this genus based on the small shell diameter and lack of interruption of ribs on the venter of the internal whorls. Storthoceras aff. garfieldense (tAylor, 1998) Pl. VIII, figs 20, 25 aff. 1998. Saxoceras garfieldense (Taylor), p. 479, figs 13.6-13.7, 13.10-13.13, 14.3-14.4. Material and measurements : Fourteen measured specimens (GSC 130741-130754) and many incomplete specimens and fragments. All material flattened except one specimen with partial, poorly preserved venter (Pl. VIII, fig. 25). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 13C-D. Description : Involute form for genus. Fine, moderately crowded sigmoid ribs on flanks. Ribs project forward on uppermost flank onto venter. On largest specimen (Pl. VIII, fig. 25), some ribs concave on flanks of outer whorl. Preservation poor but ribbing fades somewhat on venter. Suture line and whorl cross-section not preserved. Discussion : Storthoceras aff. garfieldense is most similar in ribbing number and style to the holotype of S. garfieldense (Taylor, 1998, fig. 14.3-14.4) although it may be slightly more involute than S. garfieldense at small shell diameters and is somewhat more evolute at large shell diameters. Storthoceras aff. garfieldense is similar to the slightly more evolute Schlotheimia (?) sp. A of hil-leBrandT (2000c, pl. 8, figs 26-29). The small shell diameter of the South American material precludes confident comparison with the QCI form. Aegoceras n. f. indet. of wähner (1884, pl. 23, fig. 5) is similar to the QCI form in volution and rib trajectory but has a higher num-ber of ribs at comparable shell diameters. The flank rib trajectory resembles that of Storthoceras cf. circacostatum (wähner) in hilleBrandT (2000c, pl. 6, figs 26-27) but the South American form is more involute. Flank ribs on S. aff. garfieldense are more sigmoid than in Alpine Storthoceras circacostatum. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones ; sections H and I, Coronoides Zone.

Storthoceras australe hilleBrandT, p. 23, pl. 6, fig. 12-24, text-fig. 3e-h. Material and measurements : Eight measured specimens (GSC 130755-130762) and many incomplete specimens and fragments. All material flattened. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 13C-D. Description : Evolute form for genus. Moderately crowded rursiradiate ribs. Most ribs straight to weakly concave on flanks. Occasional flank ribs weakly sigmoid. Ribs project strongly forward on upper flank. Whorl cross-section and suture line not preserved. Discussion : Storthoceras cf. australe is very similar to S. australe from South America in volution as well as rib number and orientation. Storthoceras cf. australe differs from the more involute S. aff. garfieldense from the QCI in having much less common sigmoid flank ribs. The QCI form is more involute than Schlotheimia phobetica lange. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Pleuroacanthitoides to Sunrisensis zones. Storthoceras sp. Pl. VIII, figs 9-10 Material : One partially preserved whorl fragment (GSC 130764). Description : Evolute form for genus. Whorl cross-section high suboval. Irregularly spaced flank ribs concave to sigmoid. Ribs project strongly forward on upper flank. Much weakened ribs continue across venter in forward-directed chevron. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : This fragment is assigned to Storthoceras based on the sigmoidal ribs that are clearly projected forward on the venter. More complete material is required in order for this form to be identified at the species level. This fragment is more evolute and less densely ribbed than Storthoceras aff. garfieldense from the QCI and is much more evolute than the type material of S. garfieldense from Nevada. It is less densely ribbed and has ribs that are more consistently sigmoid than S. australe from South America, S. cf. australe from the QCI and K. frigga (wähner). This fragment resembles C. harpoptychum (holland) and Curviceras cf. harpoptychum of hille-BrandT (2000c) but differs in having ribs that are more strongly sigmoid, project more strongly forward on the venter and are more irregularly spaced. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides Zone. Genus Curviceras blind, 1963 Type species : Ammonites subangularis oppel, 1862. Curviceras haidae n. sp. Pl.

VIII, figs 12-13) from the Coronoides Zone, Kennecott Point, section B, level 12, QCI. Derivation of name : Named after the Haida Native Indian tribe that is indigenous to the QCI (Haida Gwaii). Diagnosis : Moderately evolute form. Whorl cross-section high suboval. On inner whorls, flank ribs rectiradiate to weakly concave. Ribs on outer whorl more distantly spaced and weakly concave. Ribs continue uninterrupted across venter. Description : Moderately evolute form. Whorl cross-section high suboval. Umbilical wall on outer whorl upright, umbilical shoulder rounded. On inner whorls, crowded flank ribs rectiradiate to weakly concave. Ribs on outer whorl more distantly spaced and weakly concave. Ribs begin on lowest flank, increasing in strength upflank. Rib style on venter of inner whorls unknown. On outer whorl, ribs project forward on uppermost flank and continue uninterrupted across venter in a chevron that is weakly forward-directed. Ribs with greatest height midventer. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Curviceras haidae is unusual in having very strong ribbing across the venter which is similar in strength to Waehneroceras insolitum of guerin-frani-aTTe (1990) and C. hircinum (QuensTedT). However, C. haidae is more evolute and has weaker, more closely spaced ribs than the former and has concave rather than sigmoid ribs like the latter. The lateral morphology of the C. haidae is similar to Saxoceras aff. extracostatum (wähner) (Aegoceras n.f. indet, cf. extracostatum in wähner, 1882, pl. 16, fig. 1) but it differs in having much stronger ribs crossing the venter. Curviceras haidae differs from the slightly more involute S. aff. portlocki in having more dense ribbing on the inner whorls and in having ribbing that continues uninterrupted across the venter. The QCI form is more evolute than Saxoceras? ex gr. portlocki of pálfy et al. (1999, fig. 4I) and has finer more closely spaced ribs than the inner whorls of Kammerkarites cf. frigga (pálfy et al., 1999, fig. 4E). Curviceras haidae somewhat resembles the Alpine species S. curviornatum (wähner) and S. circacostatum (wähner) but differs in being more evolute, and in having ribs that are much stronger across the venter. In addition, the ribs in S. curviornatum are sigmoid rather than concave. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides Zone.

Some specimens with partial three-dimensional preservation. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 13C-D. Description : Midvolute form. Whorl cross-section high suboval with widest point of whorl low flank if ribs not considered (Pl. VIII,. Flank ribs on inner whorls crowded, sharp and usually concave. Beyond shell diameters of 30 mm, more coarse flank ribs can be concave, straight or sigmoid and rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate. Spacing between ribs variable with ribs more or less crowded. Ribs have greatest strength on uppermost flank where they project forward onto venter. Most ribs sharply interrupted on venter forming a smooth band down the midline. In some specimens, occasional ribs weaken but continue across venter in forward-directed chevron. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Saxoceras aff. portlocki differs from S. portlocki on the inner whorls in having flank ribs that are more commonly concave rather than sigmoid and weakly prorsiradiate on the flanks. It includes specimens with ribs that are less strongly projected forward on the uppermost flank and other specimens with more widely spaced ribbing on the flanks at larger shell diameters. Saxoceras aff. portlocki is probably a new species but it cannot be established until better preserved large material is found. As discussed at length by guex (1995, p. 35), S. portlocki and S. extracostatum may belong to the same species. They differ only with respect to the ventral ornament of the internal whorls. Saxoceras portlocki has ribs that are consistently interrupted on the venter whereas S. extracostatum has ribs that continue across the venter. The ventral ornament of the QCI form is intermediate between these two 'species'. Although most ribs are interrupted on the venter, occasional ribs weaken but continue across the venter. Saxoceras aff. portlocki differs from Schlotheimia cuevitensis in having flank ribs that are commonly concave rather than primarily sigmoid and weakly prorsiradiate on the flanks. It differs from W. subangulare (oppel) in being more consistently involute and in having ribs that are much less commonly sigmoid on the flanks at similar shell diameters. Ribs also continue less commonly across the venter. The QCI form resembles a specimen described under Schlotheimia angulata in hall & piTaru (2004, pl. 2, fig. 4). It differs in being more involute and in having ribs that are much less commonly prorsiradiate on the inner whorls. As discussed above, the distance between the flank ribs of S. aff. portlocki is variable. The division of the specimens into different species based on this difference would be arbitrary as there is a continuum of variation within the material. The specimens with wider spaced ribs are similar on the outer whorl to S. schroederi lange (e.g. Pl. VIII, fig. 15). Several occurrences in other areas of North American are tentatively included in the synonymy list because they differ somewhat from the QCI form. A specimen figured by hall & piTaru (2004, pl. 1, fig. 4) has ribs that are more commonly sigmoid on the flanks and are not interrupted on the venter (hall & piTaru, 2004, p. 4). The fragments figured by guex (1995, pl. 16, figs 3-4, 8-9) differ in being more depressed and in having flank ribs that are less strongly concave. imlay (1981, p. 30) describes the venter in his Alaska material as smooth along its midline, but does not mention the occurrence of occasional ribs continuing across the venter. Unfortunately, no ventral view is figured. Stratigraphic position : Sections B and I, Coronoides Zone.\n\nSpAtH, 1924 Type species : Aegoceras diploptychum wähner, 1882. Kammerkarites aff. chinchillaensis HillebrAndt, 2000c Pl. V, figs 2, 5 aff. 2000c. Kammerkarites chinchillaensis hilleBrandT, p. 15, pl. 5, figs 4-14 ; text-fig. 2h-m. Material and measurements : One measured (GSC 130776) and one incomplete specimen (GSC 130775). Both specimens flattened and poorly preserved. Measurement of volution is presented in Figure 14A. Description : One involute (Pl. V, fig. 2) and one midvolute specimen (Pl. V, fig. 5). Innermost whorls with strong, rectiradiate ribs that have greatest strength on upper flank. By shell diameters of c. 25 mm, ribs weaken. Very faint prorsiradiate ribs occur on outer whorl. Suture line and whorl cross-section not preserved. Discussion : Although the volution of the two specimens of K. aff. chinchillaensis differs, the style of ornament is very similar. Due to small sample size, a clear understanding of the variation in the volution of this form is not possible. Thus, the two specimens are not separated here. Ribbing style of the QCI form is very similar to K. chinchillaensis from South America. However, GSC 130776 (Pl. V, fig. 2) is considerably more involute than K. chinchillaensis and the QCI form may represent a new species. Stratigraphic position : Sections A and B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones.

All material flattened except one three-dimensional specimen. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 14A-B. Description : Evolute form, compressed on inner whorls. Nucleus nodose. Flank ribs rursiradiate, projecting strongly forward on uppermost flank. On three-dimen- sional specimen (Pl. VIII, figs 7-8, DMAX = c. 18 mm), ribs cross venter in a chevron of slightly greater than 90º. Discussion : guex (1981,1995) proposed K. frigga as the microconch and K. haploptychus (wähner) as the macroconch of a sexually dimorphic pair. The morphological variation seen within these two species in the QCI as well as their similar stratigraphic range supports this idea.\n\nThe material of hilleBrandT (1994, 2000c) and sTevens ( 2004) is marked with a question mark in the synonymy list. The QCI form of K. cf. frigga is similar to two specimens of Storthoceras cf. frigga of hilleBrandT (1994, pl. 1, fig. 5 ; 2000c, pl. 6, figs 28-29). It has a much lower number of ribs than the remaining specimens hil-leBrandT attributed to S. cf. frigga (1994, pl. 1, fig. 8 ; 2000c, pl. 6, figs 30-31). The small shell diameter of the South American material precludes confident comparison with the QCI form. The majority of sTevens material is not well preserved ; however, the ribs often appear too prorsiradiate on the flanks and the bend forward on the ventrolateral shoulder is less marked than in most K. frigga. As sTevens (2004, p. 33) mentions, the New Zealand form may also be more involute.\n\nSection A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones ; section B, Mulleri/Occidentalis to Coronoides zones.

Material and measurements : Three measured specimens (GSC 130790-130792) and many incomplete specimens and fragments. This form can get very large (Dmax = c. 270 mm). Material is moderately preserved ; all material is flattened. Measurements of volution are presented in Figure 14A. Description : Midvolute form for genus. Flank ribs weakly rursiradiate on innermost whorls. On intermediate whorls ribs vary from weakly rursiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate low to midflank, projecting forward on upper flank. Ribs have greatest strength low to midflank fading on upper flank. Beyond c. 125 mm shell diameter, flank ribs more widely spaced and concave to weakly prorsiradiate (Pl. V, fig. 3). Discussion : The North American K. haploptychus may include slightly more evolute forms than the alpine variety of K. haploptychus. One specimen of K. haploptychus from the QCI (Pl. V, fig. 6) and one specimen of guex (1995, pl. 19, figs 5-6) are very similar to Storthoceras (Megastomoceras) schmidti (lange) (lange, 1941, pl. 3, fig. 10).

Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 14A-B. Description : Involute form for genus. Strong prorsiradiate ribs with greatest strength mid to upper flank on inner whorls. Beyond c. 25 mm shell diameter, strong ribs rectiradiate with greatest strength midflank. Uppermost flank smooth. Discussion : hilleBrandT (2000c, p. 8) commented on the similarity of K. rectiradiatus and Discamphiceras pleuronotum. However, the large size and lack of suture line on the former form do not permit a thorough comparison. Unfortunately, the poorly preserved QCI specimen is also large and lacks a suture line. Kammerkarites cf. rectiradiatus is similar to some specimens of D. silberlingi. The former form probably differs in having ribs that are weaker on the upper flank although more and better-preserved material is required to fully assess the differences between the two forms. Kammerkarites cf. rectiradiatus has ribs that continue much less frequently onto the venter than the more evolute K. diploptychoides guex. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides Zone.

Material and measurements : One flattened measured specimen (GSC 130794). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 14A-B. Description : Midvolute form for genus. Flank ribs on innermost whorls closely spaced and weakly rursiradiate. Ribbing style between shell diameters of 40 -65 mm obscured. Beyond this, flank ribs evenly spaced and rectiradiate. Ribs begin on lowest flank, have greatest strength midflank and fade on upper flank. Ribs on last part of outer whorl weaker.\n\nDiscussion : The ribbing style of K. ex gr. megastoma is similar to K. megastoma but the two forms differ in several respects. The inner whorls of K. ex gr. megastoma are poorly preserved but suggest it is somewhat more involute at small shell diameters. In addition, it is slightly more evolute at large shell diameters and has a higher number of ribs on the outer whorls. It is not possible to recognize the cross-section or ventral features on the QCI specimen as it is flattened. Also, the single specimen does not permit an understanding of the variability within the species. More and better material is required before a new species can be established. sTevens (2004, p. 32) points out several differences between the New Zealand K. megastoma and other specimens of the genus. We consider the ribbing too prorsiradiate to be K. megastoma and the specimens are too involute.\n\nThe ribbing style and number of the QCI form are similar to K. beneckei (guerin-franiaTTe) on the outer whorls. However, the French form is much more evolute on the inner whorls.\n\nStratigraphic position : Section B, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Kammerkarites cf. praecoronoides Guex, 1980 Pl.

Material and measurements : One flattened slightly distorted specimen (GSC 130793). Description : Midvolute specimen. Nodose nucleus. Irregularly spaced, rectiradiate flank ribs. Ribs have greatest strength on upper flank projecting weakly forward on uppermost flank. Discussion : This specimen falls within the variation in rib number and volution of K. praecoronoides. Stratigraphic position : Section A, Mulleri/Occidentalis zones. Kammerkarites (?) n. sp. Pl. V, fig. 1 Material and measurements : Two flattened specimens (GSC 130773-130774). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 14A-B. Description : Evolute form. Straight flank ribs rectiradi-ate to rursiradiate on inner whorls. Beyond shell diameters of 20 mm, flank ribs slightly concave to weakly prorsiradiate. Ribs project slightly forward mid to upper flank. Ribs remain strong across entire flank. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : The QCI form is probably a new species but it cannot be formally established until better preserved material is collected. The flattened state of the current specimens means it is not possible to define whorl crosssection or ventral features. Furthermore, a suture line is lacking. Thus, its assignment to Kammerkarites is considered uncertain. Kammerkarites (?) n. sp. is similar in volution and rib number to a specimen of Curviceras cf. engonium (lange) of hilleBrandT (2000c, pl. 6, fig. 9). Poor preservation and the small size of the South American specimen hamper very close comparison. The smaller material of C. cf. engonium figured by hilleBrandT (2000c, pl. 6, figs 4-8) is more involute than the QCI form and has a lower number of flank ribs. The rib orientation of the more involute K. bayoensis hilleBrandT is similar to the QCI form but it differs having much stronger flank ribs. Kammerkarites (?) n. sp. is similar to K. paltar (wähner) but is more evolute at large shell diameters and has strong ribs that are more consistent on the uppermost flanks. The inner whorls of Kammerkarites (?) n. sp. resemble K. beneckei (guerin-franiaTTe) but the QCI form is more evolute on the outer whorls and has ribs that are much stronger on the upper flank.

Material and measurements : Eight measured (GSC 130795, 130796-130803) and many incomplete specimens (GSC 130702, 130796). In part good preservation ; some small three-dimensional specimens, large specimens partially to completely flattened. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 14C-D. Description : Midvolute form. Nucleus nodose. Crosssection of inner whorls suboval if ribs not considered ; weakly trapezoidal if ribs considered (Pl. VI, figs 5-6). Inner whorls with rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate flank ribs with ventrolateral nodes. Weakened ribs project forward on venter. In adult stage, preserved relief suggests whorl cross-section weakly trapezoidal if ribs not considered ; strongly trapezoidal if ribs considered. Ribs powerful and strongly rursiradiate. Ventrolateral nodes persist in some specimens (Pl. VI, fig. 2). Keel variable. In one specimen, keel visible beyond shell diameter of 8 mm. In other specimen, slight median protrusion but no defined keel at whorl height of 10 mm. Weakened ribs project forward on venter (Pl. VI, fig. 1). In well preserved fragment, ribs bifurcate into two or three coarse folds that project forward across venter (Pl. VI, fig. 6). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Franziceras cf. coronoides may have a slightly lower number of ribs on the inner whorls than the type material of F. coronoides. Similar to what we see in the Nevada material, the QCI form shows considerable variation in volution. One specimen from Nevada (guex, 1995, pl. 20, figs 3-4) is similar to the more evolute forms from the QCI (Pl. VI, fig. 4) whereas the other specimens from Nevada (guex, 1995, pl. 20, figs 1-2, 5-6) are similar to the more involute forms in the QCI (Pl. VI, fig. 2). However, in the QCI material, the more evolute variety of the species occurs slightly lower in section (section B, locality 12) than the more involute variety (section B, localities 18-21). More collections are required to ascertain whether this difference in stratigraphic level is due to collection failure or a true difference at the species level. As mentioned above, the inner whorls of F. cf. coronoides are virtually identical to those of F. coronoides, K. praecoronoides and F. kennecottense n. sp. from the QCI. It differs from the latter two species at larger shell diameters in having ribs that are much stronger and much more rursiradiate. In addition, the ventrolateral nodes persist to larger shell diameters in F. coronoides than in K. praecoronoides (>30 mm). The more evolute specimens of the QCI form which lack a distinct keel are very similar to F. graylockense Taylor. They differ in having ventrolateral nodes as well as in having ribs that are consistently more strongly rursiradiate at similar shell diameters. Ribs of the adult stage are more rursiradiate than in F. ruidum BuCkman. The inner and intermediate whorls of F. cf. coronoides are similar to F. sebanum (piCkler) but the QCI form differs at large shell diameters as the ribs are stronger, less crowded and more strongly rursiradiate. The QCI form is more involute than F. aff. ruidum from Nevada. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones. Franziceras kennecottense n. sp. Pl. VI, figs 3, 7-9 ; Fig. 11F Material and measurements : Seventeen measured (GSC 130805-130818, 131665-131667) and many incomplete specimens (GSC 130804). Material moderately preserved ; some three-dimensional specimens. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Text-figure 14C-D. Holotype GSC 130806 (Pl. VI, fig. 3) from the Coronoides Zone, Kennecott Point, section B, level 14, QCI.

Derivation of name : Named for Kennecott Point on Graham Island, QCI where the type material orginates. Diagnosis : Midvolute form. Whorl cross-section probably weakly trapezoidal. Moderately strong, gently sigmoid ribs weakly rursiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate. Ventrolateral nodes present. Ribs weaken on venter. Ribs can bifurcate. Some with low keel. Description : Midvolute form. Preserved relief suggests whorl cross-section weakly trapezoidal, tapering toward dorsum beyond 25 mm shell diameter. Innermost whorls nodose. Beyond this, moderately strong, gently sigmoid ribs weakly rursiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate on flanks. At top of flanks, ribs have weak ventrolateral nodes beyond which they bend sharply forward and weaken on venter. In best preserved specimen, ribs bifurcate into two or three coarse folds that project forward across venter (Pl. VI, figs 7-8). Some specimens with low keel beyond shell diameters of 12 mm (not figured due to poor preservation). Suture line not preserved. Discussion : As discussed by guex (1995, p. 34), the juvenile stage of F. coronoides guex and Kammerkarites praecoronoides guex from Nevada (guex, 1995, p. 34) are nearly identical. In addition, the inner whorls of F. kennecottense and F. cf. coronoides from the QCI are virtually indistinguishable from these two species. Franziceras kennecottense differs from K. praecoronoides at larger shell diameters as the ventrolateral nodes and keel persist and the flank ribs are much less sigmoid. It differs from F. coronoides in being more evolute and in having much weaker flank ribs that are much less rursiradiate at large shell diameters. The inner and intermediate whorls of F. kennecottense are similar to F. sebanum but the QCI form differs at large shell diameters as the ribs are less crowded and more rectiradiate. The QCI form has flank ribs that are much weaker than F. ruidum. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides to Sunrisensis zones ; section H, Coronoides Zone. Genus Schlotheimia bAyle, 1878 Type species : Ammonites angulatus sChloTheim, 1820 ; lectotype in lange, 1951, p. 31, pl. 1, fig. 2. Schlotheimia sp. Pl. VIII, figs 16-17\n\nMaterial and measurements : Five measured specimens (GSC 131668-131672) and nine incomplete specimens and fragments. Some partially preserved three-dimensional material ; maximum shell diameter of c. 30 mm. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Description : Evolute form for genus. Whorl cross-section high suboval. On one specimen where nucleus visible, three strong ribs occur (Pl. VIII, fig. 16). Beyond shell diameters of 3 mm, narrow, sharp ribbing is concave to weakly prorsiradiate on flanks. Ribs have greatest strength on uppermost flank, projecting strongly forward onto venter. Ribs form a chevron on venter with an angle of c. 90º. Ribbing is abruptly interrupted on midline of venter producing a smooth channel. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Schlotheimia sp. differs from S. angulata in being slightly more evolute and in having flank ribs that can be more strongly concave at similar shell diameters. The QCI form is similar to S. phobetica lange in volution and in having some ribs that are weakly prorsiradiate. However, it differs in having a lower number of ribs per whorl, in having some ribs that are concave on the flanks and in having ribs that are completely interrupted on the venter. It is slightly more evolute than a similar specimen from the Alpine Megastoma Zone (Aegoceras angulatum Schloth. var. ind. of wähner, 1886, pl. 20, fig. 6). Larger material is needed before this form can be identified at the species level. Stratigraphic position : Section B, Coronoides Zone.\n\nType species : Ammonites lacunatus J. BuCkman, 1844 ; designated by lange, 1924.\n\nThe generic assignments of the species dumitricai and cachinensis are uncertain as they share several of the characteristics of Bloos (1988a) which are commonly used to separate the genera Angulaticeras and Schlotheimia. This problem is discussed by hilleBrandT (2000c, p. 31). He suggests that the two American species may represent a branch of limited development within the Schlotheimiidae. Given the poor preservation of our material, we are unable to contribute to the resolution of this problem.\n\n(?) cf. dumitricai Guex 1995 Pl. VIII, figs 21, 23 cf. 1995.

Material and measurements : One flattened measured specimen (GSC 131675) and one measured external mould with preserved relief (GSC 131673). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Where the flank ribs bifurcate, both ribs are included. Description : Midvolute form for genus. Whorl crosssection high suboval. Umbilical wall upright, umbilical shoulder distinct but rounded. On inner whorls, weakly sigmoidal to straight ribs crowded and rectiradiate to weakly prorsiradiate. Occasional ribs bifurcate low flank. Ribs project slightly forward on uppermost flank. At large shell diameter (D > c. 55 mm), widest point of whorl upper flank. Weakly sigmoidal and rectiradiate to weakly rursiradiate ribs narrowest on lower flanks, thickening upflank with greatest width on ventral shoulder. Suture line not preserved. Discussion : Angulaticeras (?) cf. dumitricai is very close to the type material of the species in volution, rib number and morphology. Angulaticeras (?) dumitricai differs from the more involute A. (?) cachinensis in having ribs that bifurcate much less commonly. Stratigraphic position : Section C, Sunrisensis Zone. Angulaticeras (?) cf. cachinensis (HillebrAndt, 2000c) Pl.

Material and measurements : One poorly preserved flattened measured specimen (GSC 107376). Primary ribs = 10 ; secondary ribs = 18. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Description : Involute form of small size. Umbilical shoulder rounded. Sharp, crowded flank ribs slightly sig- moid and gently prorsiradiate. Bifurcation and intercalation of ribs common but without consistent pattern. Bifurcation at various points from umbilical shoulder to lower flank. Venter and suture line not preserved. Discussion : Angulaticeras (?) cf. cachinensis has ribs that are weaker on the lower flank, more coarse upflank and less sigmoidal than A. ventricosum (sowerBy). It is distinguished from A. trapezoidale (Sowerby) by its narrower umbilicus and finer sigmoid ribbing (smiTh & Tipper, 2000). Stratigraphic position : Section E, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones. Also occurs in the Columbiae Zone in the QCI. Schlotheimiidae gen. et sp. indet. Pl. VIII, figs 22, 24 Material and measurements : Four flattened measured specimens (GSC 131674, 131676-131678) and fragments. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. In cases where the flank ribs bifurcate, both ribs are included. Description : Involute form. Sharp, strong, rursiradiate to gently prorsiradiate flank ribs are slightly curved to weakly sigmoid. Occassional ribs bifurcate near umbilical shoulder. Flank ribs narrowest on lower flank, thickening upflank with greatest width on ventrolateral shoulder. Ribs project forward on ventrolateral shoulder. Venter and suture line not preserved. Discussion : Schlotheimiidae gen. et sp. indet. has stronger flank ribs than Angulaticeras (?) dumitricai guex and the more involute A. (?) cachinensis (hilleBrandT). It is more involute than Schlotheimia cuevitensis hille-BrandT which also lacks bifurcating ribs. Stratigraphic position : Sections B and C, Sunrisensis Zone ; sections E and F, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones. Superfamily Arietitoidea HyAtt, 1875 Family Arietitidae HyAtt, 1875 Generic assignment of late Hettangian species of the Family Arietitidae are often controversial (e.g., donovan & forsey , 1973 ;donovan et al., 1981 ;Corna, 1987 ;Bloos, 1994Bloos, , 1996 ; ;Taylor, 1998 ;meisTer et al., 2002b). Sutural characteristics, nuclear ornament, whorl cross-section and ventral features are often critical yet they are missing in the QCI material. This often makes certain identification difficult at the species level and generic assignments tenuous.\n\nGenus Gyrophioceras SpAtH, 1924 Type species : Arietites praespiratissimus wähner, 1887.\n\nThe taxonomic position of Gyrophioceras is controversial. The most recent approaches have been to consider Gyrophioceras as a subgenus of Vermiceras (Bloos, 1994(Bloos, , 1996 ; ;kmenT, 2000) or Paracaloceras (Taylor, 1998 ;sTevens, 2004). Taylor & guex (2002) have recognized Gyrophioceras as a separate genus. We follow the latter approach here based principally on the shape of the suture line that is more similar to Vermiceras in some species of Gyrophioceras and more similar to Paracaloceras in others.\n\ncf. morganense (tAylor, 1998) Pl. VII, fig. 11 cf. 1998. Paracaloceras (Gyrophioceras) morganense Taylor, p. 490, fig. 21.7-21.8, 21.11-21.12, 22. cf. 2002. Gyrophioceras morganense Taylor.-Taylor & guex, pl. 2, figs 1-2, 4. Material : One fragment (GSC 131680). Description : Involute form for genus. Crowded flank ribs weakly concave. Ribs strongest on lower and middle flank projecting forward on upper flank. No keel visible. Discussion : Gyrophioceras cf. morganense may be slightly more involute than other G. morganense. It is particularly similar to the paratype of Taylor (1998, fig. 21.11-21.12). The QCI form resembles a specimen of Alsatites sublaqueus (wähner, 1886, pl. 30, fig. 4) but differs in being more involute. It is similar to Laqueoceras cf. sublaqueus of hilleBrandT (2000a) but differs in being more evolute on the inner whorls and in having ribs that are more regular in spacing and strength.

Material : One measured (GSC 131679) and one distorted specimen. Both specimens flattened. Measurement of volution is presented in Figure 15A. Description : Evolute form for genus. Nucleus nodose. Weakly rursiradiate flank ribs straight to slightly concave. Ribs uniform in spacing and strength. Moderately strong keel present beyond shell diameters of 27 mm. Discussion : Gyrophioceras aff. praespiratissimum is similar in volution and rib number to G. praespiratissimum (wähner) but differs in having ribs that are more uniformly weakly rursiradiate. It differs from A. liasicus in having flank ribs that are less concave and has a stronger keel than A. liasicus and G. morganense. Gyrophio-ceras aff. praespiratissimum is more involute and has more strongly rursiradiate flank ribs than G. supraspiratum (wähner). Stratigraphic position : Section C, Sunrisensis Zone.

Material and measurements : One partially compressed measured specimen (GSC 107400). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Description : Strongly evolute form (UD/D = c. 70%). Flanks appear convex. Moderately densely ribbed with rib frequency increasing steadily. Rectiradiate flank ribs slightly concave adorally. Venter with low keel by shell diameter of c. 30 mm. Discussion : Gyrophioceras cf. supraspiratum is similar in volution and ribbing style to Paracaloceras (?) sp. A of hilleBrandT (2000d, pl. 11, figs 1-2). Unfortunately, a closer comparison is impossible as preservation in the QCI material is poor and the South American material is incomplete and is principally of much larger shell diameter. The QCI form is somewhat similar to G. morganense and Paracaloceras perspiratum (wähner) but differs in having more dense ribbing. It differs from Alsatites proaries in having more concave ribs and differs from evolute species of Metophioceras [e.g. M. janus spaTh, M. caesar (reynès), M. longidomus (QuensTedT)] in having flattened flanks and as far as preservation permits us to observe, lack of a tricarinate-bisulcate venter. The QCI form differs from Vermiceras scylla (reynès) in showing traces of a more prominent keel at similar shell diameters and in having straighter ribs. Stratigraphic position : Sections E and F, Mineralense/ Rursicostatum zones. Also occurs in the Columbiae Zone in the QCI.\n\nGenus Paracaloceras SpAtH, 1923b Type species : Ammonites coregonensis sowerBy, 1831. The holotype of sowerBy is lost and that figured by Canavari, 1882Canavari, , pl. 24, fig. 15 (and 1888, pl. 5, , pl. 5, fig. 15) was designated as a neotype by donovan & forsey (1973, p. 7).

Paracaloceras rursicostatum freBold.-longridge et al., pl. 2, figs 19, 21-22 ; text-figs 9U, 10I. Material and measurements : Two measured specimens (GSC 107402, 107413) and several other incompletely preserved specimens. Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Description : Evolute form. Flanks slightly convex. Dense, rectiradiate to rursiradiate, slightly concave flank ribs. When preservation allows, venter with prominent keel possibly flanked by sulci. Discussion : End members of P. rursicostatum look very different ; however, a detailed study on very well preserved material from Taseko Lakes has revealed that division of the species based on differences in volution, whorl cross-section or rib orientation, density or strength would be arbitrary (longridge et al., 2008a). Due to lack of information on ventral characteristics, it is difficult to identify the QCI material with certainty. It probably has a stronger keel than P. grunowi (hauer) and differs from Epammonites cordieri (Canavari) in having weaker flank ribs, particularly on the lowermost and uppermost flanks. It differs from P. multicostatum freBold in being slightly less densely ribbed on the innermost whorls and in having flank ribs that are much less commonly prorsiradiate. Stratigraphic position : Section E, Mineralense/Rursicostatum zones. Also occurs in the Columbiae Zone in the QCI. Paracaloceras (?) sp. Pl. VII, figs 4, 9 Material and measurements : Two measured specimens (GSC 131681-131682). Measurements of volution and ribbing density are presented in Figure 15A-B. Description : Evolute form. Nucleus probably nodose (Pl. VII, fig. 9). Strongly rursiradiate flank ribs moderately spaced. Venter with keel by 25 mm shell diameter.\n\nDiscussion : Paracaloceras (?) sp. has a lower number of flank ribs than P. rursicostatum beyond shell diameters of 30 mm and has flank ribs that are more strongly rursiradiate at very small shell diameters. The strongly rursiradiate character of the ribs is similar to Schreinbachites retroversicostatus (Canavari) although the QCI form lacks irregularities in rib spacing and strength, the keel is stronger at similar whorl heights and as far as preservation permits observation, the QCI form has a nodose nucleus.\n\nStratigraphic position : Section C, Sunrisensis Zone.\n\nAmmonite taxa from the QCI indicate the presence of all zones currently recognized in the middle and upper Hettangian portion of the North American Zonation (Taylor et al., 2001 ;longridge et al., 2006). However, the position of the boundary between the Mulleri and Occidentalis zones is uncertain. In the North American Zonation, D. antiquum, K. frigga and K. haploptychus are restricted to the Mulleri Zone whereas E. occidentalis is restricted to the Occidentalis Zone and D. silberlingi does not appear until the Occidentalis Zone. In the QCI these two groups of taxa share some or all of the same range (Fig. 9). For this reason the Mulleri and Occidentalis zones are currently maintained as one stratigraphic unit in the QCI.\n\nSimilarly, the boundary between the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones is also uncertain. Several of the key taxa that are used to characterize these zones in the North American Zonation have not yet been found in the QCI [e.g. P. mineralense Taylor, A. posttaurinum (wähner), D. ornatum Taylor, Paradiscamphiceras athabascanense Taylor in the Mineralense Zone ; Paracaloceras retroversicostatum (Canavari), Pseudaetomoceras shoshonense Taylor, Schlotheimia ex gr. stenorhyncha (lange) in the Rursicostatum Zone (Taylor et al. 2001)]. In addition, several species of the genus Badouxia are important in identifying the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones. A new study of the Badouxia fauna is necessary to update which species of the genus occur in the QCI.\n\nThe QCI are in an unusual biogeographic setting which means they contain many taxa with east-Pacific distributions as well as forms with affinities to species from New Zealand, western and eastern Tethys and, less commonly, northwest Europe. These instances permit correlations as indicated below. For the sake of simplicity, the complete record of common taxa are shown in Figure 16. Zones discussed in the text are shown in Figure 2.\n\nIn Canada, Hettangian ammonite collections are principally restricted to British Columbia with the exception of Discamphiceras cf. silberlingi that occurs in subsurface strata in northwestern Alberta. The exact level of this collection is uncertain but it is broadly placed in the middle to upper Hettangian (hall et al., 2000). At Williston Lake in British Columbia, Nevadaphyllites psilomorphus is found in lower Hettangian strata while\n\n. compressus is found in the Polymorphum Zone. Nevadaphyllites cf. compressus is also recognized in the middle Hettangian where it occurs with Togaticeras togatum, Alsatites liasicus, Saxoceras cf. portlocki and Kammerkarites frigga (hall & piTaru, 2004). Badouxia canadensis (fre-Bold) [including B. oregonensis Taylor which was placed in synonymy with B. canadensis by longridge et al. (2006)] and possibly Pseudaetomoceras doetzkirchneri occur in beds that correlate with the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones (hall & piTaru, 2004). In the Iskut River map area, Paracaloceras cf. rursicostatum occurs in what is probably either the Rursicostatum or Columbiae Zone (JakoBs & pálfy, 1994). In the Taseko Lakes area, Phylloceras cf. asperaense and T. togatum are limited to the Mineralense Zone whereas N. psilomorphus, N. aff. compressus, Eolytoceras tasekoi and E. constricutum are limited to the Rursicostatum Zone (freBold, 1967 ; longridge et al., 2008a). Discamphiceras silberlingi, P. rursicostatum, Sunrisites senililevis and B. canadensis occur in the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones while a single specimen of Pseudaetomoceras cf. castagnolai was collected from talus but is probably also from one of these two zones (freBold, 1951(freBold, , 1967 ; ;longridge et al., 2006, 2008a, b). These taxa permit correlation with the QCI succession.\n\nNevadaphyllites compressus, N. psilomorphus and the possible occurrence of P. doetzkirchneri allow broad correlations between Williston Lake and the QCI in the Hettangian whereas N. cf. compressus, A. liasicus, T. togatum, S. cf. portlocki and K. frigga permit tighter correlation with the middle Hettangian. Badouxia canadensis permits correlations between the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones in Taseko Lakes, Williston Lake and the QCI, although in the latter area, the species ranges into the Columbiae Zone. Direct correlations are possible between Taseko Lakes and the QCI in the Mineralense and Rursicostatum zones using S. senililevis, E. constrictum and P. rursicostatum whereas more broad correlations are possible between the two areas using E. cf. tasekoi whose range extends into the Morganense Zone and D. silberlingi that occurs in the middle Hettangian in the QCI. Finally, P. cf. rursicostatum in the Iskut River area permits broad correlation with the Mineralense through Columbiae zones in the QCI.\n\nIn Alaska, the best stratigraphic section with Hettangian faunas is in Puale Bay where Kammerkarites cf. frigga, K. ex gr. megastoma, D. cf. silberlingi, Mullerites cf. pleuroacanthitoides and Saxoceras aff. portlocki occur in strata that are broadly equivalent to the Mulleri to Pleuroacanthitoides zones whereas E. cf. tasekoi, P. cf. rursicostatum and possibly B. canadensis occur in strata that are probably equivalent to the Rursicostatum Zone, although the Mineralense Zone cannot be excluded (imlay, 1981 ; pálfy et al., 1999 ; longridge et al., 2006). Outside of Puale Bay, Alaskan faunas are generally less well constrained stratigraphically because collections often come from isolated localities and often consist of single species (imlay, 1981). Saxoceras aff.\n\nOregon and Nevada in the United States have many taxa that permit correlation with the QCI ammonite succession whereas taxa from the Sonora region in Mexico permit much more limited correlation. In Oregon, N. compressus is found in the Morganense and Mineralense zones (Taylor, 1998 ;Taylor et al., 2001 ;Taylor & guex, 2002). Gyrophioceras morganense, G. aff. supraspiratum and D. silberlingi occur in the Morganense Zone whereas B. canadensis occurs in the Mineralense Zone (Taylor, 1998 ;Taylor & guex, 2002). Finally, P. aff. rursicostatum occurs in the Columbiae to Trigonatum zones (Taylor, 1998 ;Taylor & guex, 2002). In Nevada, N. compressus occurs in the Pacificum and Polymorphum zones (guex, 1980, 1995 ;Taylor et al., 2001). Togaticeras cf. togatum was collected ex situ but is probably from lower Hettangian strata whereas Fergusonites striatus ranges throughout the middle Hettangian (guex, 1980, 1995 ;Taylor et al., 2001). Discamphiceras antiquum, K. frigga, K. rectiradiatus and K. haploptychus occur in the Mulleri Zone, Euphyllites occidentalis is limited to the Occidentalis Zone and K. praecoronoides, Franziceras coronoides and possible S. portlocki occur in the Coronoides Zone (guex, 1980, 1995 ;Taylor, 1998). Pleuroacanthites biformis is found in the Mulleri through Pleuroacanthitoides zones whereas D. silberlingi ranges from the Occidentalis to Pleuroacanthitoides zones (guex, 1980, 1995). Mullerites pleuroacanthitoides, Eolytoceras praecursor, N. psilomorphus and Storthoceras garfieldense are limited to the Pleuroacanthitoides Zone (guex, 1980, 1995 ;Taylor, 1998 ;Taylor et al., 2001). Discamphiceras submesogenos and A. ex gr. proaries occur in the Pleuroacanthitoides and Sunrisense zones (guex, 1995 ;Taylor et al., 2001).\n\nPseudaetomoceras doetzkirchneri occurs in the Pleuroacanthitoides through Mineralense zones, Angulaticeras (?) dumitricai occurs in the Sunrisense through Mineralense zones and P. castagnolai is limited to the Sunrisense Zone (guex, 1995 ;Taylor, 1998). Eolytoceras tasekoi is recognized from the Rursicostatum Zone whereas P. rursicostatum and B. canadensis are found in the Mineralense through Columbiae zones (guex, 1995 ;Taylor, 2000). In Mexico, B. canadensis permits correlation of what are probably the Rursicostatum and Columbiae zones and possibly the Trigonatum Zone (gonzález-león et al., 1996 ;Taylor et al., 2001 ;Taylor & guex, 2002) with the Mineralense to Columbiae zones in the QCI. The middle and late Hettangian phylloceratids from the QCI permit broad correlations with the Hettangian in Nevada and Oregon. In Nevada, several ammonite taxa permit direct correlation with the QCI faunas. Direct correlations in the Mulleri/Occidentalis zones are possible using E. occidentalis, D. antiquum, K. haploptychus and K. frigga. The possible occurrence of S. aff. portlocki suggests a direct correlation with the Coronoides Zone whereas P. biformis permits direct correlation of the Mulleri/Occidentalis through Pleuroacanthitoides zones. Discamphiceras cf. submesogenos permits direct correlation of the Pleuroacanthitoides and Sunrisensis zones. Finally, B. canadensis and P. rursicostatum permit direct correlation of the Mineralense through Columbiae zones in both areas. In several cases, the ranges of the taxa from Nevada differ somewhat although they are still useful for correlation. Broad correlations are possible between in the middle Hettangian using A. ex gr. proaries, S. garfieldense and M. pleuroacanthitoides, K. rectiradiatus, K. praecoronoides, F. coronoides and D. silberlingi. Eolyto-ceras praecursor is limited to the Pleuroacanthitoides Zone whereas in the QCI it occurs in the Coronoides through Pleuroacanthitoides zones. Pseudaetomoceras castlagnolai occurs only in the Sunrisense Zone whereas in the QCI it extends from the Pleuroacanthitoides through Morganense zones. In the QCI, A. (?) dumitricai and P. doetzkirchneri are limited to the Sunrisensis Zone whereas in Nevada they range from the middle middle to late Hettangian. In Oregon, G. morganense permits direct correlation with the Morganense Zone. It is possible to make broad correlations between the late Hettangian and early Sinemurian in the QCI and Nevada and Oregon using B. canadensis, G. supraspiratum and P. rursicostatum in Oregon and E. tasekoi in Nevada. South Pacific South America South America has numerous taxa in common with the middle and late Hettangian faunas from the QCI. Nevadaphyllites compressus occurs in the Tilmanni Subzone and Phylloceras asperaense occurs in the Reissi through Peruvianus zones (hilleBrandT, 2000a) whereas F. cf. striatus and Kammerkarites chinchillaensis permit correlation with the Bayoensis Zone (hilleBrandT, 2000a, c). Discamphiceras aff. antiquum and D. aff. pleuronotum (hilleBrandT, 2000a, c) occur in the Reissi Zone. Storthoceras australe definitely occurs and K. frigga may occur in the Australe Horizon (hilleBrandT, 2000c). Alsatites cf. liasicus, Sunrisites chilensis and Angulaticeras (?) cf. cachinensis occur in the Peruvianus Zone (hilleBrandT, 2000c, d). Badouxia canadensis occurs throughout the Canadensis Zone (geyer, 1979 ;Quinzio sinn, 1987 ;hilleBrandT, 1990hilleBrandT, , 1994hilleBrandT, , 2000b, c), c). Alsatites cf. liasicus occurs in slightly younger strata in South America than in the QCI whereas A. (?) cachinensis occurs in slightly older strata. Fergusonites cf. striatus and K. chinchillaensis can be used to correlate the Bayoensis Zone with the Mulleri and Occientalis zones in the QCI. Discamphiceras aff. antiquum, D. aff. pleuronotum and the possible occurrence of K. frigga permit broad correlations between the Reissi Zone in South America with the Mulleri/Occidentalis through the Coronoides zones in the QCI whereas S. australe suggests a slightly youger association of the Australe Horizon with the Pleuroacanthitoides and Sunrisensis zones. Sunrisites chilensis permits correlation of the South American Peruvianus Zone with the Sunrisensis and Morganense zones. Badouxia canadensis permits correlation of the Canadensis Zone in South America with the Mineralense through Columbiae zones in the QCI. New Zealand Based on the work of sTevens (2004), approximate correlations are possible between the QCI ammonite successions and those of New Zealand although often the identifications of New Zealand material are questionable. Possible K. frigga occurs in what is probably the early middle Hettangian in New Zealand and permits correlation with the Mulleri/Occidentalis through Coronoides zones in the QCI. In New Zealand, possible N. psilomorphus occurs in what are probably middle to lower upper Hettangian strata equivalent to the North American Mulleri to Morganense zones and permits broad correlations with the middle Hettangian in the QCI. Finally, possible E. tasekoi may occur in the late Hettangian of New Zealand permiting broad correlation with the late Hettangian in the QCI. Europe Western Tethys (circum-Mediterranean) Many of the middle and late Hettangian QCI taxa also occur in the Tethyan circum-Mediterranean area. These correlations have added importance as Mediterranean faunas are now quite well correlated with successions in northwest Europe, permitting indirect correlations with the primary standard succession (e.g., Bloos, 1983 ;guérin-franiaTTe, 1990 ;mouTerde & Corna, 1997 ;page, 2003). In Austria, N. psilomorphus is found throughout the Hettangian (neumayr, 1879 ;lange, 1952 ;dommergues et al., 1995 ;Böhm et al., 1999 ;kmenT, 2000) whereas in Hungary, N. cf. psilomorphus is found from talus that is very likely to be from the lower to middle Hettangian (pálfy et al., 2001). Togaticeras togatum is found in lower and middle Hettangian strata in Austria (rakús, 1993a, 1999 ; kmenT, 2000). The Hettangian phylloceratids from the QCI permit broad correlations with the Hettangian of the circum-Mediterranean.\n\nPleuroacanthites biformis is found in the Megastoma Zone in Austria and probably the late Hettangian in Italy (Canavari, 1888 ;wähner, 1894 ;venTuri, 1985). Pseudaetomoceras castagnolai occurs in the Marmoreum Zone in Austria and probably the late Hettangian in Italy (Canavari, 1882 ;wähner, 1886 ;Canavari, 1888 ;venTuri, 1985 ;kmenT, 2000). Eolytoceras cf. tasekoi occurs in the Marmoreum Zone in Austria (kmenT, 2000) and can be used to indicate the presence of upper Hettangian strata. Discamphiceras pleuronotum and A. proaries occur in the Megastoma Zone in Austria and probably the upper Hettangian in Italy (wähner, 1884, 1886 ;Canavari, 1888 ;lange, 1952 ;venTuri, 1985). Pseudaetomoceras doetzkirchneri, K. haploptychus, K. frigga and K. megastoma occur in the Megastoma Zone in Austria (wähner, 1882, 1884, 1886 ;lange, 1952 ;Blind, 1963 ;rakús, 1999). Gyrophioceras praespiratissimum occurs in the Megastoma and Marmoreum zones in Austria and the late Hettangian in Italy (wähner, 1887 ;BerTinelli et al., 2004). Gyrophioceras supraspiratum occurs in the Megastoma and Marmoreum Zones in Austria, probably occurs in the late Hettangian in Italy and possibly occurs in the late Hettangian in Spain (wähner, 1888 ;Braga et al., 1984 ;Canavari, 1888 ;venTuri, 1985 ;BerTinelli et al., 2004). Kammerkarites megastoma also occurs in the Liasicus Zone in the West Carpathians (rakús, 1993b).\n\nBroad correlations are possible between the middle and upper Hettangian ammonite successions in the QCI and the Hettangian and earliest Sinemurian in the eastern Tethys. Nevadaphyllites cf. psilomorphus is found in the Calliphyllum Zone in Tibet (yin et al., 2007) and permits broad correlation with middle Hettangian strata in the QCI. Pleuroacanthites aff. biformis, D. pleuronotum and K. frigga occur in the Pleuronotum Zone in Tibet (yin et al., 2007) and permit correlations with the Mulleri through Pleuroacanthitoides zones in the QCI. Finally, E. aff. tasekoi occurs in lower Sinemurian strata that are probably equivalent to the Conybeari or Rotiforme subzones in Vietnam (meisTer et al., 2002a) and permit broad correlations between the earliest Sinemurian in Vietnam and the late Hettangian in the QCI. Northwest Europe Several taxa from the middle and late Hettangian in the QCI permit direct correlations with the northwest European successions. These successions (e.g., dean et al., 1961 ;mouTerde & Corna, 1997 ;page, 2003) are considered the primary standard for Early Jurassic biochronology (Callomon, 1984). Thus, these correlations have added importance. Kammerkarites haploptychus is recognized from the Laqueus Subzone in England (donovan, 1952) and permits correlation with the Mulleri/Occidentalis to Coronoides Zones in the QCI. Caloceras bloomfieldense occurs in the Liasicus Zone in England and possibly the Portlocki Subzone and definitely the Laqueus Subzone in Wales (donovan, 1952 ; dean et al., 1961 ; hodges, 1986), S. portlocki occurs in the Portlocki Subzone in France and the Liassicus Zone in England (donovan, 1952 ;dean et al., 1961 ;elmi & mouTerde, 1965 ;guerin-franiaTTe, 1990) and A. liasicus occurs in the Laqueus Subzone in France and England and in the middle Hettangian in Germany (lange, 1941 ;donovan, 1952 ;elmi & mouTerde, 1965 ;sChlegelmilCh, 1976 ;guerin-franiaTTe, 1990). These taxa permit direct correlation of the Coronoides Zone in the QCI with the middle Hettangian successions in Europe. In addition K. megastoma occurs in strata from the Planorbis Zone in Germany, the Laqueus Subzone in England and the middle and late Hettangian in France (donovan, 1952 ;sChlegelmilCh, 1976 ;guerin-franiaTTe, 1990). These taxa allow broad correlations between the middle and late Hettangian ammonite successions in the QCI and the Hettangian and early Sinemurian in Europe.\n\nThe rich Hettangian ammonite fauna from the QCI is principally of east Pacific and Tethyan affinities although some important taxa with Boreal affinity are also present.\n\nThe QCI are part of the displaced terrane, Wrangellia (Jones et al., 1977). Based on faunal evidence, Wrangellia is believed to have been in the eastern Pacific and the northern Hemisphere during Permian through Early Jurassic time (e.g., monger, 1984 ;Taylor et al., 1984 ;smiTh & Tipper, 1986 ;Belasky, 1994 ;aBerhan, 1999 ;smiTh et al., 2001 ;Belasky et al., 2002 ;smiTh, 2006 ;longridge et al., 2008b).\n\nThe Hettangian ammonites in the QCI support this claim. They have strong affinity with contemporaneous endemic faunas from other areas of North America, particularly Nevada. Correlations with South America are also strong and suggest open communication throughout the eastern Pacific during Hettangian time.\n\nBased on ammonite and bivalve distribution patterns, it has been proposed that Wrangellia was displaced northward between several hundred to over 1000 km since Sinemurian and Pliensbachian times (e.g., Taylor et al., 1984 ;aBerhan, 1999 ;smiTh, 2006). Today, the QCI are at a similar latitude to the autochthonous Fernie Basin which contains the Williston Lake Hettangian ammonite fauna (hall & piTaru, 2004). However, the diversity is far greater in the QCI fauna than the Williston Lake fauna where the succession lacks Paradasyceras, Fergusonites, Ectocentrites, Eolytoceras, Pleuroacanthites, Euphyllites, Caloceras, Mullerites, Angulaticeras and Franziceras (hall & piTaru, 2004). The succession in the QCI is more similar to the Nevada fauna in composition as well as diversity. Nevada was also part of autochthonous North America during the Hettangian. A diversity gradient is commonly recognized from north to south on the craton with increasing diversity toward the equator (smiTh & Tipper, 1986 ;smiTh, 1999 and references therein). The difference in diversity between the Williston Lake faunas and the QCI and Nevada faunas as well as the strong similarities between the QCI and Nevada faunas support the hypothesis of a significant northward displacement of Wrangellia relative to the craton since Early Jurassic time.\n\nThe QCI contain the most diverse middle and late Hettangian ammonite fauna in Canada. In total, fifty-three taxa from the Mulleri/Occidentalis through Mineralense/ Rursicostatum zones are present including five new species, Paradasyceras carteri, Franziceras kennecottense, Pleuroacanthites charlottensis, Ectocentrites pacificus and Curviceras haidae. This study greatly expands our knowledge of the fauna and ranges of North American ammonites during the Hettangian and significantly improves the accuracy of the North American regional ammonite zonation. In addition, it permits correlations with other areas of North America, South America\n\n, New Zealand, western and eastern Tethys, and northwest Europe in the Hettangian and early Sinemurian. The QCI fauna supports the location of Wrangellia in the northern Hemisphere and the eastern Pacific during the Hettangian and suggests the terrane has been displaced significantly northward since the Hettangian.
