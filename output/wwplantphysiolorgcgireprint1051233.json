    "abstract": "Plastid chaperonin-60 protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from Brassica napus using a nove1 protocol. The purified protein, which migrated as a single species by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, contained four polypeptides: three variants of p6OcPnb0\" and p60'p\"60s. Partial amino acid sequence determination demonstrated that each variant of p6OCpn6\"\" is a distinct translation product. During this study, additional chaperonin-60 proteins were purified. These proteins, which were free from contaminating plastid chaperonin-60, were separated into at least two high molecular weight species that were resolved only by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These proteins contained three 60-kD polypeptides. Two of these polypeptides were recognized by existing antisera, whereas the third was not. Partial amino acid sequence data revealed that each of these, including the immunologically distinct polypeptide, is a chaperonin-60 subunit of putative mitochondrial origin. The behavior of chaperonin-60 proteins during blue A Dyematrex chromatography suggests that this matrix may be generally useful for the identification of chaperonin-60 proteins.\nMolecular chaperones are proteins required for the posttranslational folding and assembly of many polypeptides into active conformations\n(Ellis and van der Vies, 1991;\nGething and Sambrook, 1992)\n. Chaperonins are sequence-related molecular chaperones found in prokaryotes and in the plastids and mitochondria of eukaryotes\n(Hemmingsen et al., 1988;\nEllis and van der Vies, 1991)\n. The oligomeric structures of most mitochondrial, plastid, and bacterial chaperonin-60 proteins are conserved, each appearing as a stack of two rings with 7-fold symmetry (Cpn6OI4) (",
    "full_text": "naby, British Columbia, Canada V3J 5G1. 233 (Marte1 et al., 1990). The precise subunit composition of plastid Cpn6OI4 has not been determined: it may be restricted (a&, aI4, P14), or unrestricted (q$14.\"). The structure of the plastid co-chaperonin (GroES homolog) is also distinct from that of the mitochondrial or bacterial co-chaperonins (Chandrasekhar et al., 1986;Lubben et al., 1990;Bertsch et al., 1992;Hartman et al., 1992). The structurally distinct plastid and bacterial chaperonin-60 proteins are also biochemically distinct. Plastid Cpn6OI4 dissociates reversibly in vitro in the presence of concentrations of Mg2+-ATP that have little effect on the structure of Escherichia cali GroELI4 (Hemmingsen and Ellis, 1986;N. Lissin, personal communication).\n\nThe two distinct polypeptides of plastid Cpn6OI4 may possess specialized functions. Evidence consistent with this was obtained from studies of Brassica napus cpn60-a and cpn60-/3 genes expressed in E. coli (Cloney et al., 1992a(Cloney et al., , 1992b)). Although high levels of soluble p60'pnh0\" accumulated, it was not efficiently assembled into tetradecameric chaperonin unless cpn60-/3 was co-expressed. In contrast, p60'Pnbo0 was efficiently assembled in E. coli in the presence or absence of p60'P\"60\". Thus, it appears that some function, required for the assembly of p6OCPnboe, is contributed by p60'p\"600 but not by GroEL.\n\nAntibodies raised against synthetic oligopeptides with amino acid sequences derived from B. napus cpn60-a and cpn60-/3 cDNA clones recognized four putative chaperonin-60 polypeptides present in B. napus plastid stromal protein (Cloney et al., 1992b). Three of these were identified as a polypeptides and one as a /3 polypeptide (Cloney et al., 1992b). We wished to determine if the three a polypeptides result from posttranslational modification of a single gene product. To facilitate this and further in vitro studies, a protocol for purification of B. napus plastid Cpn6OI4 has been developed.\n\nBrassica napus seeds (approximately 5 X 10') were sown in soil (2.5 m2 X 3 cm) and grown for 6 to 7 d at 22OC in near darkness. Seedlings were exposed to 42OC for 2.5 h immediately before use. A11 steps were carried out at 4OC. Seedlings cut at the soil surface were disrupted using a Polytron ho-Plant Physiol. Vol. 105,1994 mogenizer in 10 L of an iso-osmotic isolation medium (0.35 M SUC, 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.6). This treatment produced a slurry in which little intact stem or leaf material was visible. This was filtered though four layers of cheesecloth and two layers of Miracloth. The filtrate was centrifuged (1,60Og, 4 min). The pellet was resuspended in 1.2 L of a hypotonic Iysis buffer (buffer A: 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.3, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) then centrifuged (15,00Og, 10 min).\n\nThe supernatant was retained and solid (NH4)2S04 was added to 30% saturation. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (lO,OOOg, 30 min), the supernatant was recovered, and solid (NH4),SO4 was added to 70% saturation.\n\nPrecipitated protein was redissolved in 80 mL of buffer A and recentrifuged (28,00Og, 30 min).\n\nThe cleared supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (5.0 X 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A containing 15% glycerol). The desalted extract was cleared by centrifugation as before and applied to a Fractogel EMD DEAE 650 (S) (E. Merck, Gibbstown, NJ) ion-exchange column (2.5 x 16 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed at 3 mL min-' with 200 mL of buffer B and bound protein was eluted with a O to 0.6 M NaCl linear gradient in buffer B. SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis was used to identify fractions containing chaperonin-60 protein. Activity assays were not employed since the quantities of chaperonin-60 protein required for in vitro polypeptide refolding (Herskowitz, 1987;Mendoza et al., 1991Mendoza et al., , 1992) ) were impractical. Optimum fractions were pooled and solid (NHJ2S04 was added to 65% saturation. Precipitated protein was recovered as before, desalted over Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer B, centrifuged (lO,OOOg, 10 min), and concentrated to 2 to 5 mL with Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon).\n\nThe concentrated protein was applied at 0.5 mL min-' to a blue A Dyematrex (Amicon) column (2.5 X 18 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. Fractions containing chaperonin-60 protein were detected, pooled, and precipitated as before. Precipitated protein was redissolved in 200 to 400 pL of buffer B, passed through a 0.22-wm filter, and applied to a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer C (buffer B with 100 mM NaCI).\n\nMolecular mass standards were carbonic anhydrase (29 kD), albumin (66 kD), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kD), a-amylase (200 kD), apoferritin (443 kD), and thyroglobulin (669 kD) (Sigma). Fractions containing chaperonin-60 protein (approximately 840 kD) were pooled, diluted 2-fold with buffer B, and applied to a Fractogel EMD DEAE 650 (S) ion-exchange column (0.5 x 5.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed (10 mL of buffer B, 0.5 mL min-I) and bound protein was eluted as before. Fractions containing chaperonin-60 protein were pooled and concentrated with Centricon-100 centrifugal microconcentrators (Amicon). Purified chaperonin-60 protein was stored at less than 5.0 mg mL-' at -2OOC.\n\nSDS-PAGE, nondenaturing PAGE, and immunoblot analysis were as described (Cloney et al., 1992b). Severa1 different antisera were employed: (a) anti-a anti., l-erum was raised against an a-specific synthetic oligopeptide as described (Cloney et al., 1992b); (b) anti-/? antiserum was raised against a /?-specific synthetic oligopeptide as described (Cloney et al., 1992b); (c) anti-a/P antiserum was generated by mixing equal volumes of the anti-a and the anti-/3 oligopeptide antisera; (d) anti-plastid Cpn60 antiserum was raised against purified Pisum sativum plastid Cpn6OI4 as described (Hemmingsen and Ellis, 1986); (e) broad-specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum was raised against hybrid chaperonin-60 species isolated from Escherichia coli cells that expressed a modified B. napus cpn60-/? gene (Cloney et al., 1992b). A soluble protein extract was prepared from E. coli /? cells as described (Cloney et al., 1992b) and applied to a Sephacryl 5300 gel-filtration column (2.5 X 60 cm) equilibrated with buffer C. Fractions containing high M, chaperonin-60 protein includirig both E. coli GroEL and plant p60'P\"60p polypeptides were pooled, and approximately 1 mg of protein was subjected to nondenaturing PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, and the band corresponding to Cpn6014 was excised. Protein recovered by electroelution in an ELUTRAP electro-separation chamber, as described by the manufacturer (Schleicher & Schuell), was used to generate a polyclonal anti-Cpn6OI4 antiserum in rabbits. The antiserum was used without further treatment at <a dilution of 1:lOOO Total protein was estimated as described (Bradford, 1976). Polypeptides in purified chaperonin-60 protein were estimated on silver-stained SDS gels by comparison to seria1 dilutions of E. colr GroEL that had been quantified by nitrogen determination (gift of N. Lissin). The recovery of chaperonin-60 polypeptides at each purification step was then estimated by coniparing the signal intensities on SDS-PAGE immunoblots to those from the purified protein. Quantities of proteins in the crude stromal fraction were not determined since the methods employed did not allow reliable estimates from this source.\n\nPurified chaperonin-60 protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE: and blotted to nitrocellulose as described (Cloney et al., 1992b). After staining with Ponceau S, bands corresponding to each p60 polypeptide were excised and submitted in parallel to in situ digestion (Aebersold et al., 1987) with lysyl endopeptidase (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting peptide mixtures were individually separated by narrow-bore reverse-phase HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard 1090 chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Optimum fractions from these chromatograms were chosen based on differential UV A at 210, 277, and 292 nm. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry of these fractions was performed on a Finnigan Lasermat time-of-flight m a s spectrometer (Finnigan Mat Corp., San Jose, CA) prior to automated Edman degradation. Details of strategies for the selection of peptide fractions and their microsequencing have been desciibed previously (Lane et al., 1991). Arrows indicate the positions of migration of mol wt markers: rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97,400), BSA (66,200), hen egg white ovalbumin (45,000), and bovine carbonic anhydrase (21,500).\n\nP. sativum plastid Cpn60i 4 contains two polypeptides with slightly different electrophoretic mobilities: p60 cpn60 \" and the more rapidly migrating polypeptide p60 cpn6W (Hemmingsen and Ellis, 1986). Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the P. sativum polypeptides were determined (Musgrove et al., 1987). Comparison of these sequences with the sequences predicted from two B. napus chaperonin-60 cDNA clones indicated that the cDNAs encoded a p60 c P n60 \" and a P 60 cpn6W polypeptide. A crude soluble protein extract from B. napus was analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis using several different antisera (see \"Materials and Methods'). The anti-a antiserum recognized three bands, referred to as al, al, and a3 (Fig. 1A). The and-/? antiserum recognized one band, referred to as /3 (Fig. IB). The anti-a//3 and anti-plastid Cpn60 antisera both recognized each of these four bands (Fig. 1C, the anti-plastid Cpn60 antiserum result is shown). The broad specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum recognized these four bands plus an additional band that migrated between a3and/J(Fig.\n\nA protocol for the purification of P. sativum plastid Cpn60 14 has been reported (Hemmingsen and Ellis, 1986), but those procedures failed to separate B. napus plastid Cpn60 14 from Rubisco, the most abundant stromal protein. Therefore, a novel protocol was developed. B. napus seedlings grown under low-light conditions were used in this study, since the specific content of plastid Cpn60 14 was similar to that of seedlings grown under normal light conditions, whereas the content of Rubisco was much lower. This method (see \"Materials and Methods\") chosen for production of a crude soluble protein extract resulted in a modest enrichment for plastid proteins. It also resulted in a low initial yield of protein from the plant material; however, the presence of oxidized phenolic compounds was avoided.\n\nProteins in a crude soluble extract were subjected to ionexchange chromatography. Protein eluting between 0 and 0.6 M NaCl was analyzed on SDS-PAGE immunoblots with the broad specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum. Two distinct sets of immunologically reactive 60-kD polypeptides were observed (Fig. 2). One set, with the pattern expected for B. napus plastid Cpn60i 4 (al, al, a3, and /3), eluted with a peak at approximately 320 ITIM NaCl. In addition, two immunoreactive polypeptides of approximately 60 kD eluted with a peak at approximately 270 ITIM NaCl. The more slowly migrating of these corresponded to the polypeptide from the crude extract that migrated between «3 and /3 (Fig. ID). The other polypeptide migrated in the same position as the plastid /3 polypeptide (Fig. IB).\n\nAfter ion-exchange chromatography, fractions containing the plastid chaperonin-60 polypeptides were pooled. A separate pool was made of the putative chaperonin polypeptides that eluted at lower salt concentrations (LS chaperonin-60 polypeptides: LSI and LS2, Fig. 2). The subsequent purification steps were similar for both pools of proteins and included dye-ligand, gel-permeation, and ion-exchange chromatography. The approximate yields and purification of the chaperonin-60 polypeptides from each step were estimated as described (see \"Materials and Methods\") and are summarized in Tables I and II. Plastid Cpn60 ]4 was estimated to be 17 times more abundant than LS chaperonin-60 protein in the crude soluble extract, and the yield of plastid Cpn60 H was significantly higher.

These polypeptides were recognized by both the broad-specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum (Fig. 4B, lane 3) and the anti-a/P antiserum (Fig. 4C, lane 3 ) . Crude extracts from two different preparations are shown in lanes 1 of Figure 4, B and C. The extract in Figure 4C shows the more complex pattern of immunoreactive Cpn6O polypeptides that was sometimes observed. The additional bands, however, were eliminated in the course of the purification, and the final purified plastid Cpn6OI4 protein in a11 cases comprised four Cpn60 polypeptides by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4C, lane 3). The purified plastid CpnbO,, was subjected to nondenaturing PAGE immunoblot analysis using the broad-specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum (Fig. 5A, lane 3) and the anti-a/P antiserum (Fig. 5B, lane 3 ) . In each case, a single high-M, species was recognized.\n\nPreviously, an E. coli strain was transformed with a B. napus cpn-60a cDNA clone that had been modified to remove the nucleotides encoding the predicted transit peptide (Cloney et al., 1992b). This E. coli strain accumulated a nove1 polypeptide that co-migrated with the a 2 polypeptide of B.\n\nnapus (Cloney et al., 1992b). We have isolated a second distinct cDNA clone that also produced a product in E. coli that co-migrated published data).\n\nwith the B. napus a 2 polypeptide (our un-It remained possible that the B. napus a1 and a 3 polypeptides resulted from posttranslational modification of a2. Therefore, the amino acid sequences were determined for severa1 proteolytic peptides resulting from endoproteinase Lys-C digestions of a l , a2, and a 3 . To minimize the effort required to identify sequence clifferences, proteolytic fractions of similar retention and UV absorbance ratios were screened for molecular mass differences by matrix-assis ted laser desorption mass analysis prior to microsequencing,. As expected based on the E. coli expression study, the determined amino acid sequence of an a 2 fragment (Fig. 6, a 2 fragment I) was identical to the sequence predicted from the a2 cDNA (GenBank accession No. M35599). Comparison of the a 2 fragment I sequence to that of an a1 fragment (Fig. 6, a1 fragment I) revealed a single amino acid difference (Ala+ Ser). The amino acid sequence of a second fragment from a1 (Fig. 6, a1 fragment 11) differed at one position from the predicted sequence for the corresponding region of a 2 (Ser-Phe). Thus, a1 and a 2 are distinct translation products. The sequence of a third fragment from a1 (Fig. 6, a1 fragment 111) was identical to the predicted sequence of the corresponding region of a2 but differed at two sites (LysLeu-ThrPhe) from the sequence of a fragment from a3 (Fig. 6, a 3 fragment 111). Thus, a 3 is a third distinct translation product. Therefore, at least two distinct transcripts in B. napus encode a 2 polypeptides with two other transcripts encoding a1 and a3 polypeptides.\n\nRelative to the fraction obtained after ammoriium sulfate precipitation, the LS putative chaperonin-60 protein was finally purified more than 1500-fold with an estimated yield of 7% (Fig. 3 8 , Table 11).

Protein recovered from each of the five successive chromatography steps indicated in Table I were analyzed for the purities of plastid Cpn60 14 (A) and LS chaperonin-60 protein (B) on SDS-PACE silver-stained gels (lanes 1-5). An increased loading of the protein recovered from the final purification step is shown in lane 6. Plastid Cpn60 polypeptides, ol, «2, «3, and /3, and putative chaperonin-60 polypeptides, LS1, LS2, and LS3, are indicated. Arrows indicate the positions of migration of mol wt markers; rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97,400), BSA (66,200), hen egg white ovalbumin (45,000), and bovine carbonic anhydrase (21,500).\n\nfractions were not completely free of contaminating proteins (Fig. 4A, left lane). Immunoblot analysis with the broadspecificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum confirmed the presence of two putative chaperonin-60 polypeptides, LSI and LS2 (Fig. 4B, lane 2), neither of which was recognized by the anti-a//? antiserum (Fig. 4C, lane 2). Thus, these polypeptides are components of chaperonin-60 protein that are immunologically distinct from the plastid protein. An additional immu- nologically unrelated polypeptide with an M r of approximately 60,000 (LS3) was also present at a level that was visible by silver staining (Fig. 4A, left lane). Since LS3 copurified with LSI and LS2 in each of the chromatography steps (not shown), it seemed likely that it was an immunologically unrelated chaperonin-60 polypeptide.\n\nThe broad-specificity anti-Cpn60 antiserum recognized purified LS chaperonin-60 protein as a predominant high-M r species resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 5A, lane 2). A second species, which migrated slightly faster under these gel conditions, was also faintly visible with this antiserum. The relative abundance of the two species varied between preparations. Nondenaturing PAGE immunoblot analysis of purified LS chaperonin-60 protein from an independent preparation revealed two distinct bands of approximately equal intensity (Fig. 5A, inset, lane 2). Neither of these high-Mr species was recognized by the anti-a/0 antiserum (Fig. 5B, lane 2).\n\nPeprides resulting from endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of each of LSI, LS2, and LS3 were subjected to amino acid sequence determination. Alignment of these sequences to the corresponding sequences predicted from published chaperonin-60 genes permitted the identification of LSI, LS2, and LS3 as chaperonin-60 polypeptides (not shown). In each case the determined amino acid sequences were most similar to known plant mitochondria! chaperonin sequences.\n\nSequence data were obtained for corresponding fragments of LSI and LS2. From these it is clear that LSI and LS2 are distinct translation products, since they differ at 3 of 21 positions (Fig. 7A). The amino acid sequence of the LSI fragment is identical to amino acid residues 434 to 456 of the predicted Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial chaperonin-60 polypepride (Prasad and Stewart, 1992) (GenBank accession No. 211546), whereas the sequence of the corresponding LS2 fragment is identical to that of the predicted Zea mays mito- Plant Physiol.

The amino acid sequence o f the LS3 fragment is distinct f r o m the predicted sequences o f either the A. thaliana or the Z. mays mitochondrial chaperonin-60 polypeptides (Fig. 7B).\n\nThe plastid a n d mitochondrial Cpn6OI4 proteins behaved similarly w h e n subjected to chromatography ovf!r blue A Dyematrex (Fig. 8). In each case, the first protein recovered f r o m the column included highly p u r i f i e d chaperonin-60.  exhibited this behavior (H.B. Wu, personal communication). Thus, blue A Dyematrex chromatography may be useful for identifying chaperonin-60 proteins from other sources. It was noted that the recovery of chaperonin-60 proteins from blue A Dyematrex chromatography was subject to variation. In an independent experiment, fractions were pooled after ion-exchange chromatography to produce a sample that included B. napus plastid and mitochondrial Cpn60i4 proteins. Approximately 2-to 3-fold more protein was present in this sample, and it included proteins from several fractions that were excluded from the previous experiments.\n\nA proportion of the Rubisco from this sample did not bind to the column, indicating that the column was overloaded, at least for this protein (Fig. 9A, fractions with high A 2 ao)-Furthermore, plastid and mitochondrial chaperonin-60 polypeptides were detected in the fractions between 0.5 and 3.0 bed volumes. From this large volume we infer that a proportion of the chaperonin-60 proteins displayed stronger interactions with this column than in the previous experiment, in which chaperonin-60 polypeptides were recovered between 0.50 and 1.25 bed volumes (Fig. 8). Proteins recovered between 1.75 and 3.0 bed volumes were therefore pooled and passed over a regenerated blue A Dyematrex column. The chaperonin-60 proteins were recovered between 0.50 and 1.25 bed volumes from this regenerated column (Fig. 9B). It seems likely that the chaperonin-60 proteins recovered in the late fractions from the first blue A Dyematrex column had interacted, not directly with column matrix, but rather with other proteins present in the sample. Thus, this chromatography step should be monitored to ensure maximum recovery of chaperonin-60 protein.\n\nWe have purified B. napus plastid Cpn60 to apparent homogeneity using a novel protocol. This protocol will also provide sufficient quantities of Cpn60 14 to perform in vitro studies of its structure and function. Four polypeptides, ol, a2, «3, and /?, co-purified and migrated as a single high-M r species by nondenaturing PAGE and thus may be subunits of a single plastid Cpn60 ]4 molecular species. By direct amino acid sequence determination we have found that each of the three a-type polypeptides is a distinct translation product. Thus, cDNA clones corresponding to al and a3 remain to be described. The presence of multiple distinct a-type polypeptides may reflect the amphidiploid nature of B. napus; however, we have observed the presence of two a-type polypeptides in the diploid A. thaliana (our unpublished observation).\n\nIn the course of this study other chaperonin-60 proteins, immunologically distinct from the plastid protein, were purified. These additional chaperonin proteins, although not purified to homogeneity, were free from contaminating plastid chaperonin-60 protein. In these fractions, two high-M r species were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE and two 60-kD polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. These two polypeptides were recognized only by a subset of the antisera that was developed against plastid chaperonin-60 protein.\n\nPartial amino acid sequence analysis revealed that LSI and LS2 are chaperonin-60 polypeptides. Further, these determined sequences are most similar to plant mitochondrial chaperonin-60 sequences predicted from nucleotide sequence data. Thus, LSI and LS2 are two chaperonin-60 polypeptides of putative mitochondrial origin that have similar reactivity to the antisera used in this study but have distinct amino acid sequences. The identity of the determined partial sequence of LSI to the published A. thaliana sequence and of LS2 to the published Z. mays sequence suggests that LSI and LS2 are encoded by paralogous genes, genes present at distinct loci, that are present in both dicot and monocot plants.\n\nA third 60-kD polypeptide co-purified with LSI and LS2 but was not recognized by any of our anti-chaperonin-60 antisera. Amino acid sequence data confirm that this immunologically distinct polypeptide is a chaperonin-60 polypeptide, and indicate that it is also of putative mitochondrial origin. It remains to be determined if a homolog exists in monocot plants. The distributions of LSI, LS2, and LS3 in seedlings have not been determined and further study is required to determine the subunit composition(s) of the putative mitochondrial chaperonin-60 proteins. Mitochondrial chaperonin-60 proteins from diverse species have been reported to be composed of a single subunit type (McMullin and Hallberg, 1988;Hutchinson et al., 1989;Prasad and Hallberg, 1989;Reading et al., 1989;Cheng et al., 1990), although partial amino acid sequence data indicate that moth (Heliothis virescens) mitochondrial chaperonin-60 contains two distinct polypeptides that may co-assemble to form a hetero-heptameric protein (Miller et al., 1990). Thus, evidence from moth and now from higher plants suggests that mitochondrial chaperonin proteins may be more complex than previously thought.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.
