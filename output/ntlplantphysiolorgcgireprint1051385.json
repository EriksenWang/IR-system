    "abstract": "We examined the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the LOX7 gene during the development of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Measurements of steady-state LOX7 mRNA levels indicated that this gene is transiently expressed. during germination. LOX7 mRNA was not detected in seed that had imbibed (To) but reached a maximum leve1 by 1 d in both light-and dark-grown seedlings. l h e induction of the LOX7 gene was not light dependent; however, mRNA levels were 4-fold greater in light-grown seedlings. lmmunoblot analysis of lipoxygenase protein levels and measurements of enzyme activity suggested that the induction of the LOX7 gene resulted in the production of functional lipoxygenase enzyme. Lipoxygenase protein was not present in dry seed or seed that had imbibed, but was first detected by immunoblot analysis after 1 and 2 d of growth in the light and dark, respectively. In both cases, lipoxygenase protein levels remained high for 2 d and then declined. Lipoxygenase activity paralleled the changes in protein levels. In situ hybridization studies revealed that the LOX7 gene is transiently expressed in the epidermis and the aleurone layer during germination. LOX7 mRNA levels were particularly high in the epidermis of the radicle and the adaxial side of the cotyledons. These resuits suggest that the LOX7 gene product is produced specifically during early germination and plays a role in the functioning of the epidermis.",
    "full_text": "Lipoxygenases catalyze the hydroperoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acids, which contain a pentadiene double bond system (see Mack et al., 1986;Vick and Zimmerman, 1987;Hildebrand et al., 1988;Siedow, 1991, for reviews). The primary products of the lipoxygenase reaction are typically metabolized into molecules of known or suspected regulatory activity. In mammals, lipoxygenase-derived fatty acid hydroperoxides are precursors for the synthesis of a number of eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes, lipoxins, and thromboxans) that regulate specific cellular responses (Anderson, 1989). In higher plants, two major pathways have been described for the metabolism of fatty acid hydroperoxides. They are known collectively as the \"lipoxygenase pathway\" (Vick and Zimmerman, 1987). One branch of the lipoxygenase pathway produces traumatic acid, a compound that may be involved in wound responses in plant cells (Zimmerman and Coudron, 1979), as well as C6 volatiles such as trans-2hexenal, which is antimicrobial and may play a role in pathogen defense (Croft et al., 1993). The second branch This work was supported by National Science Foundation grants DCB-8904717 and IBN-9220254 to T.K.P.\n\nproduces jasmonic acid, a molecule likely to serve a regulatory role in plant cells (Staswick, 1992;Sembdner and Parthier, 1993). At physiological concentrations jasmonates promote seed germination (Berestetzky et al., 1991;Ranjan and Lewak, 1992) and stimulate cell division (Ravnikar et al., 1992). In addition, it has also been suggested that jasmonates are involved in a wound-and pathogen-induced signaltransduction cascade (Farmer and Ryan, 1992).\n\nThe in vivo functions of lipoxygenase in higher plants are not clear. However, evidence has accumulated that indicates that plant lipoxygenases may play an important-role in a variety of processes, including stress responses (Bell andMullet, 1991, 1993), pathogen defense (Croft et al., 1993;Melan et al., 1993), senescence, and the regulation of growth and development (Hildebrand et al., 1988;Siedow, 1991). Unfortunately, it has been difficult to determine the exact function of lipoxygenase in these processes, in part because the plants examined to date have large lipoxygenase gene families that encode a number of lipoxygenase isozymes (Siedow, 1991). In the hope of finding a more simple system for studying the physiological functions of lipoxygenase in higher plants, we initiated a molecular genetic and biochemical analysis of the lipoxygenases of Arabidopsis thaliana. A similar approach has been undertaken by Bell and Mullet (1993). A11 studies to date indicate that Arabidopsis contains a very simple lipoxygenase gene family. Only two members have been identified. We previously identified the LOXI gene of Arabidopsis (Melan et al., 1993) and Bell and Mullet (1993) have identified a second lipoxygenase gene in Arabidopsis, AtLox2, which is distinct in sequence and expression pattems from LOXI.\n\nWe are interested in the function of lipoxygenases during germination and ear!y development. Increases in lipoxygenase activity during germination have been reported for a number of plant species, including soybean (Holman, 1948;Hildebrand and Hymowitz, 1983;Park and Polacco, 1989;Kato et al., 1992), wheat (Guss et al., 1968), pea (Anstis andFriend, 1974), barley (Yabuuchi, 1976;Doderer et al., 1992), rice (Ohta et al., 1986), cucumber (Matsui et al., 1988(Matsui et al., , 1992)), lupine (Beneytout et al., 1988), andVicia sativa (Andrianarison andBeneytout, 1992). For rice (Ohta et al., 1986), cucumber (Matsui et al., 1992), and soybean (Park and Polacco, 1989;Kato et al., 1992;Park et al., 1994), evidence consistent with the de novo synthesis of lipoxygenases during gennination has also been reported. In rice, the increase in lipoxygenase activity during germination is inhibited by cyclohexamide (Ohta et al., 1986), whereas in cucumber cotyledons the increase in activity has been correlated with an Plant Physiol. Vol. 105, 1994 increase in lipoxygenase protein as determined by immunoblotting (Matsui et al., 1992). In soybean, Park and Polacco (1989) have shown that at least two lipoxygenase isozymes, with isoelectric points distinct from the well-characterized seed lipoxygenase isozymes, appear in the hypocotyl/radicle axis during germination. Results from protein-labeling experiments suggested that these axis lipoxygenase species are newly synthesized during germination. Park et al. (1994) have also recently characterized two soybean lipoxygenase cDNA clones that are expressed in the axis during germination and are likely to encode the germination-associated lipoxygenase isozymes. In the cotyledons of germinating soybeans, Kato et al. (1992) have identified three new lipoxygenase isozymes. AI1 of these can be distinguished from the seed isozymes by ion-exchange chromatography, and the partia1 protein sequence of one (L-4) is distinct from the seed isozyme sequences.\n\nIn the studies presented here, we have examined the\n\nexpression of the LOXZ gene of Arabidopsis during the germination and early development of light-and dark-grown seedlings. These results indicate that the LOXl gene is under strict temporal and spatial control during germination. The LOXZ gene is transiently expressed in the epidermis during the 1st d of development, the time during which the radicle emerges. We have also shown that the induction of the LOXl gene is correlated with the transient accumulation of functional lipoxygenase enzyme. These results suggest that the LOXZ gene product is important for a function of the epiderm i s at a precise time during development and provide the background required for \"antisense\" experiments, which will directly test this hypothesis.\n\nArabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seedlings were wet with 0.002% (v/v) Tween 20 and then surface sterilized by washing with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min followed by two washes with sterile water and a 10-min treatment in 30% (v/v) bleach. The sterilized seeds were then extensively washed with sterile water, suspended in 1 mL of 0.1% (w/v) agarose/2500 seeds, and plated on defined mineral nutrient medium containing 0.6% (w/v) agarose (Estelle and Somerville, 1987) on 100 X 20 mm Petri plates. Approximately 2500 seeds were plated on each plate. The plates were covered and sealed with filter tape (Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, NC) to allow for gas exchange and then incubated in the light at 4OC for 72 h to break dormancy and synchronize germination. To samples were collected after the 4OC incubation. The plates were then transferred to a 24OC chamber and grown under continuous illumination (200-300 pE m-' s-') with a combination of fluorescent and incandescent lamps or under continuous darkness. Samples were collected at To and at various times thereafter and frozen in liquid Nz. Samples were ground to a powder in liquid NZ with a mortar and pestle and stored at -8OOC.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated by phenol-SDS extraction and LiCl precipitation (Ausubel et al., 1987). RNA samples (10 pg)   were separated by electrophoresis on formaldeh yde-agarose gels (Ausubel et al., 1987), transferred to nylon filters (Biotrans, ICN, Irvine, CA) by capillary transfer in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and cross-linked to the filter by UV irradiation (200 pW cm-2 for 12-15 min). A parallel set of samples were run and stained with 1 pg/mL of ethidium bromide to verify even loading of samples. The filters were prehybridized for 1 to 2 h and then hybridized ovemight at 65OC with the full-length LOXl cDNA clone (Melan et al., 1993) labeled with [a-32P]dCTP by random prirning (Multiprime IGt, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). This probe does nclt hybridize with the AtLox2 gene under these conditions. The filters were washed twice at room temperature in 0.5% (MI/V) BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and 5% (w/v) SDS followed by four 15-min washes at 65OC ir1 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and 1%~ (w/v) SDS (Church and Gilbert, 1984). The damp filters were exposed to Kodak X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) at -8OOC with a Cronex intensifying screen (Dupont).\n\nSoluble protein extracts were prepared at 4OC by homogenization of frozen tissue powders in 0.1 M sodiurn phosphate (pH 6.51) and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. The ho-mogenaLtes were clarified by centrifuging twice ai 13,OOOg for 15 min each. An aliquot of the supematant was used for determination of the total protein concentration using the method of Bradford (1976) with BSA as a standard. For the preparation of gel samples, aliquots of the restilting supernatant were immediately mixed with an equal volume of 2 X SDS sample buffer (125 mM Tris-C1, pH 6.8, 4%' [w/v] SDS, 20% [v/v] glycerol, 0.02% [w/v] bromphenol blue) and frozen in liqui'd NZ. The soluble proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) and then transferred ekrtrophoretically from the gels to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride filters (IMillipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were blocked by incubation for 1 to 16 h in 10% (I&) powdered nonfat dry milk di:jsolved in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-C1, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% [v/v] Tween 20). The filters were washed three times for 10 min each in TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h with a Y:lO,OOO dilution of an Arabidopsis lipoxygenase antibody in TBS-T containing 5% (w/v) powdered nonfat dry milk. The antibody had been raised against a lipoxygenasemaltose binding fusion protein produced in Estherichia coli (Peterman et al., 1994). The filters were then washed three times for 10 min each in TBS-T with 5% (w/v) powdered nonfat tlry milk and incubated for 1 h with a 1:lOOO dilution of a dcinkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. The filters were again washed three times for 10 min each in TBS-T with 5% (w/v) powdered nonfat dry milk.\n\nThe resulting immune complexes were detected vrith the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nSoluble protein extracts were prepared as described above except ,that the extraction buffer contained 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10 ITIM EDTA, and the BCA protein assay (Pierce) was used to determine the total protein concentration. The extracts were not frozen but rather used immediately for enzyme-activity assays. Lipoxygenase activity was measured polarographically in a 2.0-mL reaction vessel fitted with a Clark-type O? electrode. The assays were performed at 25°C in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and initiated by the addition of 1.3 mM linoleic acid emulsified in Tween-20 according to the method of Surrey (1964).\n\nSeedlings were fixed for 24 h at room temperature with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 50 mM Pipes, pH 7.2, containing 2 mM CaCl 2 , dehydrated through an ethanol series, cleared in xylenes, and embedded in paraffin (TissuePrep, Fisher Scientific). Sections (7 jum thick) were mounted onto slides coated with 100 Mg/ m L poly-L-Lys (Sigma). After deparaffinization and rehydration, the tissue sections were treated for 30 min with 1 /ig/mL proteinase K (Boehringer-Mannheim) in 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 HIM EDTA at 37°C and then acetylated (Hayashi, et al., 1978) with 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine for 5 min at room temperature. Following dehydration through ethanol and air drying, the sections were hybridized overnight at 42°C with RNA probes prepared from a linearized Bluescript plasmid containing nucleotides 1258 to 2640 of the LOX1 cDNA (AAtLoxl-1; Melan et al., 1993). 35 S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (RNA Transcription Kit, Stratagene). Probes were applied to the sections at an average concentration of 4 X 10 7 cpm/mL in a hybridization solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, lx Denhardt's solution (0.02% [w/v] Ficoll, 0.02% [w/v] PVP, 0.02% [w/v] BSA), and 100 mM DTT. After hybridization, the slides were washed three times at room temperature in 4x SSPE (lx SSPE = 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM EDTA), and 5 mM DTT, then treated for 30 min at 37°C with 25 jug/mL RNase in 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 HIM EDTA. The slides were subsequently washed three times at room temperature with 2x SSPE, 5 HIM DTT and then washed three times at high stringency with O.lx SSPE, 1 mM DTT at 57°C. Following dehydration through an ethanol series containing 300 mM ammonium acetate and air drying, the slides were coated with Kodak NTB2 autoradiography emulsion (Eastman Kodak) diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 600 mM ammonium acetate. The hybridized tissues were exposed to the emulsion for 17 d at 4°C and subsequently developed for 3 min in Kodak D-19 developer (Eastman Kodak). Tissue sections were stained with 0.025% (w/v) toluidine blue O and coverslips were mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Bright-and darkfield microscopic observations were made using an Olympus Vanox microscope, and photographs were taken on Kodak TMax 400 film developed with Kodak D-76 developer (Eastman Kodak).\n\nThe LOX1 gene of Arabidopsis is induced upon bacterial pathogen attack and also by the phytohormones ABA and methyl jasmonate (Melan et al., 1993). To determine if this gene is also temporally regulated during early seedling development, LOX1 steady-state mRNA levels were determined during development of light-and dark-grown plants. Seeds were plated on a defined mineral nutrient medium (Estelle and Somerville, 1987) without Sue and incubated at 4°C for 72 h to break dormancy. T 0 samples were collected after the 4°C incubation. The plants were then grown in either continuous light or dark at 24°C. Arabidopsis seedlings grown in this manner are shown in Figure 1. Under these conditions germination frequencies were approximately 100% and development of the majority of seedlings was synchronous.\n\nLOX1 steady-state mRNA levels were determined by RNA gel-blot hybridization analysis of total RNA isolated from samples collected at T 0 and during the following 5 d (Fig. 2). Equivalent amounts of total RNA were loaded in each lane as determined by the ethidium bromide staining intensity of the rRNA bands. LOX1 mRNA was not detected at T 0 . LOX1 steady-state mRNA levels increased dramatically during the 1st d of development of both light-and dark-grown plants.\n\nIn light-grown plants LOX1 mRNA was first detected at 12 h, whereas in dark-grown plants it was not detected until 1 d. In both light-and dark-grown seedlings LOX1 mRNA levels were maximal at 1 d and then declined during subsequent days of development. Maximal LOX1 mRNA levels in light-grown plants were approximately 4-fold greater than Plant Physiol. Vol. 105, 1994 6h 12h 1d 2d 3d 4d 5d 60, 50-Figure 2. iOXJ gene induction during Arabidopsis seedling development. Steady-state LOX1 mRNA levels were determined by RNA gel-blot hybridization analysis. Total RNA was extracted, separated on formaldehyde gels, and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Equivalent amounts of RNA (10 Mg), as determined by ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal RNAs, were loaded for each time point. The membranes were probed with a LOX1 cDNA fragment 32 P labeled by the hexanucleotide random-priming procedure.\n\nthose observed in dark-grown plants. The appearance of light-and dark-grown plants was identical for the 1st d (Fig. 1). After 12 h the seed appeared swollen by comparison to the To seed, and within 1 d the radicles had emerged.\n\nLipoxygenase protein (Fig. 3) and enzyme activity (Fig. 4) levels were measured to determine if the observed induction of the LOX1 gene results in the increased production of functional lipoxygenase protein early in development and is thus physiologically relevant.\n\nLipoxygenase protein levels were measured by immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts. Protein extracts were prepared from light-and dark-grown seedlings collected at intervals over a 6-d time course. Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically from the gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed with an Arabidopsis lipoxygenase antibody that had been raised against a lipoxygenase-maltose binding fusion protein produced in E. coli. The Arabidopsis lipoxygenase detected by this antibody is 98 kD (Peterman et al., 1994). This is in agreement with the size S T o 6h 12h 1d 2d 3d 4d 5d 6d  of the LOX1 gene product predicted from the full-length cDNA sequence (Melan et al., 1993). In the resulting immunoblots lipoxygenase protein was not detected in dry seed or at TO (Fig. 3). Lipoxygenase protein was first detected after 1 and 2 d of growth in the light and dark, respectively. In both light-and dark-grown seedlings the lipoxygenase protein levels remained high for 2 d and then declined during subsequent days of development.\n\nLipoxygenase enzyme activity levels were also measured during the early development of light-and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. The results are shown in Figure 4. The lipoxygenase activity levels paralleled the levels of lipoxygenase protein detected by immunoblot analysis. In light-grown plants an approximately 13-fold increase in lipoxygenase activity, relative to that of T 0 seed, was observed on the 1st d of growth. Within 2 d a 15-fold increase in activity was observed. In dark-grown plants the increase in lipoxygenase activity was only 3-fold on the 1st d. Within 2 d of growth in the dark an 8-fold increase in activity was observed. In both light-and dark-grown plants, the maximal level of activity was observed after 2 d of growth. Lipoxygenase activity levels then declined during subsequent days of development.\n\nAfter 2 d of growth, the time of maximal lipoxygenase enzyme activity, there were pronounced morphological differences between the light-and dark-grown seedlings (Fig. 1). In the light-grown seedlings the cotyledons were green and expanding and root growth and root-hair formation had begun. The dark-grown seedlings exhibited extensive hypocotyl elongation, with no cotyledon expansion or root-hair formation.\n\nIn situ hybridization analysis of sectioned plant material was used to elucidate the spatial expression patterns of the LOXl gene during germination. Light-and dark-grown plant material, collected at To and 1, 2, and 3 d, was fixed, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 7-pm sections. The sections were hybridized with either sense or antisense 35S-labeled LOXl RNA probes and examined by bright-and dark-field microscopy .\n\nLongitudinal (Figs. 5, E and F, and 6C) and cross-sections (Fig. 5, G and H) from seed collected at To were hybridized with a LOXl antisense probe. No LOXl mRNA was detected in these sections, in agreement with the RNA gel-blot hybridization analysis (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained with sections from seed collected at To hybridized with a LOXl sense probe (data not shown).\n\nHybridization of longitudinal (Figs. 5, A and B, and 6A) and cross-sections (Figs. 5, C and D, and 6B) from 1-d-old light-grown seedlings, with an antisense probe, revealed that the LOXl gene is highly expressed in epidermal cells within the 1st d of development. In dark-field micrographs of both longitudinal (Fig. 5A) and cross-section (Fig. 5C) hybridization, signal was evident throughout the embryos but was most concentrated in the epidermal cells of the radicle and the adaxial side of the cotyledons. Hybridization was also seen in the aleurone layer, which is closely associated with the innermost cell layers of the testa.\n\nThe location of the LOXl mRNA in specific cell layers is most evident in the high-magnification bright-field micrographs shown in Figure 6. The hybridization signal in the epidermal cells of the adaxial surface of the cotyledons (c) is shown in Figure 6A. Hybridization of the probe with the epidermal cells of the radicle (r) and the abaxial surface of a cotyledon (c) is seen in Figure 68. Hybridization signal over the aleurone layer of cells (a), a remnant of the endosperm (Vaughn and Whitehouse, 1971), is also shown in Figure 68. Similar results were obtained with sections from 1-d-old dark-grown seedlings, with the exception that the concentration of hybridization signal was not as great as in the lightgrown seedlings (data not shown). LOXl mRNA was not detected in sections from 2and 3-d-old seedlings hybridized with the antisense probe (data not shown).\n\nNo hybridization signal was detected in sections from 1-d light-grown plants hybridized with the LOXl sense probe (Fig. 5, I-L). These results provide strong evidence that the hybridization signal detected in sections hybridized with the antisense probe (Figs. 5, A-D, and 6, A and B) was due to specific hybridization with the LOXl mRNA.\n\nThe LOXl gene was previously shown to be regulated by pathogen attack and the phytohormones ABA and jasmonic acid (Melan et al., 1993). The experiments presented here have demonstrated that the LOXl gene is also under precise temporal and spatial control during seed germination. Taken together, these results suggest that the LOXZ gene product functions not only in plant stress responses but also in seed germination.\n\nWe have measured LOXl steady-state mRNA levels during the development of both light-and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig. 2). The LOXl gene was transiently expressed early in development. LOXl mRNA levels were maximal within the 1st d of development and then rapidly declined. These results indicate that expression of the LOXl gene is under very precise temporal control. Furthermore, these data suggest that the product of the LOXZ gene functions during a precise time in development. Similarly in soybean, two seedling axis lipoxygenase transcripts were not detected in the seed but accumulated during germination. Unlike the LOXl mRNA, however, these transcripts continue to accumulate during early seedling development (Park et al., 1994).\n\nThe transient accumulation of the LOXl mRNA is correlated with an increase in enzymically active lipoxygenase protein. Measurements of lipoxygenase protein (Fig. 3) and enzyme activity (Fig. 4) levels revealed an increase in functional lipoxygenase protein in both light-and dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. It is likely that this increase in active lipoxygenase is due to the production of the LOXl-encoded protein. Of the two lipoxygenase genes identified in Arabidopsis, only the LOXl gene is highly expressed during ger- mination. The AtLox2 gene is expressed in seedlings following gennination (Bell and Mullet, 1993) at levels at least 1 order of magnitude lower than the LOXI transcript (data not shown). These results suggest that the increase in LOXl mRNA results in the production of functional lipoxygenase enzyme and is thus physiologically significant.\n\nBiochemical studies of the LOXl -encoded lipoxygenase will be essential for determining the role of this enzyme in germination. In mammalian cells lipoxygenase reaction products are precursors to a number of molecules that regulate specific cellular responses, and this is likely to be the case for plant cells as well (Siedow, 1991). Determination of the regiospecificity for hydroperoxidation of the germination-specific Arabidopsis lipoxygenase will provide information needed to determine the type of lipoxygenase metabolites that can possibly be produced. It will also be important to directly identify the lipoxygenase-derived metabolites that are produced in young seedlings. Such studies have provided a starting point for the characterization of the the germinationassociated cotyledon lipoxygenases of soybean (Kato et al., 1992) and should provide valuable insights into the role of the LOXl -encoded lipoxygenase in gennination.\n\nLOXZ mRNA and lipoxygenase protein and activity levels were determined in both light-and dark-grown plants because in Sinapis alba, a close relative of Arabidopsis, lipoxygenase synthesis was reported to be down-regulated by light and controlled by phytochrome in the cotyledons of young seedlings (Oelze-Karow and Mohr, 1976). In addition, there is evidence that the phytochrome system controls the expression of soybean lipoxygenase genes (Maccarrone et al., 1991). The induction of the LOXl gene and production of functional Epoxygenase protein was not down-regulated in the light. Rather, light-grown seedling LOXZ mRNA levels were ap- proximately 4-fold greater than those in dark-grown seedlings. In addition, the LOX1 mRNA was detected 12 h earlier in the light-grown seedlings. Similarly, lipoxygenase protein and activity levels increased earlier and to higher levels in light-grown plants. It will be interesting to determine the reasons for these differences. It is possible that light enhances expression of the LOX1 gene directly. Alternatively, light may exert an influence in a more indirect way by its photomorphogenetic effects. Although l-d-old light-and darkgrown seedlings were indistinguishable, by 2 d the morphogenetic effects of light were pronounced.\n\nThe spatial distribution of the LOX1 mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization. The results demonstrated that the LOX1 gene is expressed transiently in the epidermis and in the aleurone layer during germination. No LOX1 mRNA was detected in seeds that had imbibed (To). However, within 1 d the LOX1 mRNA was found at high levels in the epidermis, especially of the radicle and the adaxial side of the cotyledons. The LOX2 gene was also highly expressed in the aleurone layer, which is intimately associated with the testa (Figs. 5 and 6). A low level of expression was detected throughout the embryo. In sections of 2-and 3-d-old seedlings no LOX1 mRNA was detected. This is the first localization of a specific plant lipoxygenase mRNA.\n\nSeveral immunolocalization studies of soybean lipoxygenase proteins have been reported (Vernooy-Gerritsen et al., 1983;Tranbarger et al., 1991;Grimes et al., 1992). However, multiple lipoxygenase isozymes are present in soybeans and it is likely that the antibodies used for all of these studies cross-reacted with a number of these species. Vernooy-Gerritsen et al. (1983) immunolocalized lipoxygenase proteins in germinating soybean seeds. They found a high signal throughout the cotyledons during the 1st d of germination due to the seed lipoxygenases. Within 3 d lipoxygenase protein was detected in the abaxial hypodermis, the vascular bundle sheaths, and the epidermis. Tranbarger et al. (1991) showed that in soybean leaves lipoxygenase proteins were localized primarily in the vacuoles of paraveinal mesophyll cells. A much lower level of lipoxygenase was also detected in the epidermal cells. In methyl jasmonate-treated soybean seedlings lipoxygenase proteins accumulated in the shoot tips, primary leaves, epicotyls, hypocotyls, and cotyledons (Grimes et al., 1992). Especially high levels of lipoxygenase protein were seen in the epidermal cells of the cotyledons and the cortical cells of the hypocotyl.\n\nThe expression of the LOX1 gene in the aleurone layer is intriguing. This cell layer, which is derived from the endosperm during embryogenesis, is typical of seeds of the Brassicaceae (Vaughn and Whitehouse, 1971). Its function during seed germination, however, is unknown.\n\nA number of genes that are expressed in the epidermis at some point in the life cycle of the plant, including members of the phenylammonia lyase and chalcone synthase gene families (Schmelzer et al., 1989), lipid transfer protein genes (Sossountzov et al., 1991;Sterk et al., 1991), genes involved in flower pigmentation (Jackson et al., 1991;Goodrich et al., 1992), and soybean Pro-rich cell-wall proteins (Wyatt et al., 1992), or genes that are epidermis specific (Clark et al., 1992) have been identified. It will be interesting to determine if the regulatory sequences of the LOX1 gene share homology with other germination-specific and/or epidermally expressed genes. From such an analysis it may be possible to identify putative regulatory sequences required for gene expression, specifically in the epidermis and/or during germination.\n\nThe epidermis controls water loss and gas exchange and provides mechanical and chemical defense against pathogen and predator attack. In addition, it has been postulated that plant organ growth is controlled by the epidermis (Nick et Plant Physiol. Vol. 105, 1994al., 1990). The epidermal location of the LOXl mRNA a n d its transient accumulation in young seedlings suggest that lipoxygenase contributes to one of these functions of the epidermis during germination. O n e possibility is that the LOXl gene product is required for the production of molecules that function prophylactically in the protection of young seedlings from pathogens. It is interesting to note that the mRNAs of severa1 other defense-related genes, which encode enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, are localized to the epidermis in uninfected plants (Schmelzer et al., 1989) a n d accumulate transiently during germination (Kubasek et al., 1992). It h a s been postulated that the phenylpropanoid pathway is required for the production of flavanoids, which protect the young seedlings from UV light or pathogens (Kubasek et al., 1992). Another possibility is that the LOXl gene product generates fatty acid hydroperoxide precursors to molecules that regulate the growth or expansion of the epidermis. Interestingly, jasmonic acid, a lipoxygenasederived metabolite, stimulates germination in some species (Berestetzky et al., 1991;Ranjan a n d Lewak, 1992).\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.
