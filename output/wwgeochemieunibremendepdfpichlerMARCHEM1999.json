    "abstract": "Ž\n. Submarine, hydrothermal venting occurs at Tutum Bay in shallow 5-10 m water along the inner shelf that contains a Ž . patchy distribution of coral-algal reefs. Two types of venting are observed. 1 Focused discharge of a clear, two-phase fluid from discrete orifices, 10-15 cm in diameter. Discharge temperatures are between 89 and 988C and estimated flow rates are Ž . as high as 300 to 400 lrmin. 2 Dispersed or diffuse discharge that consists of streams of gas bubbles ubiquitous in the Ž . Ž . Ž . area. The composition of the gas is mainly CO 92.6-97.9% with minor amounts of N 2.2-4.7% , O 0.43-0.73% , 2 2 2 Ž . Ž . CH 0.6-2% and He ; 0.01-0.02% . Based on their geographic position and chemical composition, the vents have been 4 divided into two groups, A and B. Area B vents have higher K, Rb, Sb, Cs, Tl, and As and lower Ca, Li, Mn, Fe, and Sr concentrations. Their chemical difference is likely caused by subsurface mixing of a CO -rich water with a deep reservoir 2 neutral chloride fluid in varying proportions. A two-or possibly three-step process controls fluid evolution and final\nŽ . chemical composition: 1 phase separation in the deep reservoir beneath Ambitle Island produces a high temperature vapor that rises upward and subsequently reacts with cooler ground water to form a low pH, CO -rich water of approximately 2 Ž . 150-1608C. 2 The steep topography causes lateral movement of this CO -rich fluid towards the margin of the 2 hydrothermal system where it mixes with the marginal upflow from the deep reservoir. This produces a dilute chloride water of approximately 1658C. A third step may be the entrainment of minor amounts of ground or seawater during its final ascent. Based on a B-RbrCs mixing model, it has been estimated that approximately 10% of the deep reservoir fluid reaches the surface. Compared to seawater, the hydrothermal fluids are depleted in Cl, Br, SO , Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Sr and enriched in 4 HCO , B, Si, Li, Mn, Fe, Rb, Cs, Sb, Tl and As. Although some elements are significantly enriched, they do not have a 3 clear impact on ambient seawater composition because their concentration is buffered by mixing and uptake into secondary minerals. Only the surface water in Tutum Bay carries a clear imprint of the hydrothermal fluids.",
    "full_text": "The chemical composition of seawater is controlled through the combined effort of numerous processes, such as low and high temperature seafloor alteration, fluvial and atmospheric input, and sedimentation. Most studies of seafloor hydrothermal activity have focused primarily on deep-sea, hydrothermal systems found along volcanically active portions of the mid-ocean ridges or in deep back-arc basins. Submarine hydrothermal activity and hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust, however, is not confined to deep-water environments. Additional locations are found in much shallower water at the flanks of volcanic islands and on the tops of Ž seamounts e.g., Vidal et al., 1978;Vidal et al., 1981;Sarano et al., 1989;Butterfield et al., 1990;Varnavas and Cronan, 1991;Dando and Leahy, 1993;Hodkinson et al., 1994;Pichler et al., 1995;Heikoop . et al., 1996;Sedwick and Stuben, 1996 . The sub-merged flanks of island arc volcanoes provide an exceptional opportunity to study the essential differences and similarities between subaerial and submarine venting and the transition from one to the other.\n\nHere we report on the chemistry of shallow-water hydrothermal fluids in Tutum Bay and their effect on ambient seawater composition. In this near-shore, shallow-water setting, physicochemical conditions may not be drastically different from on-shore hydrothermal systems, for example, in terms of pressure and temperature, but their discharge into seawater sets them apart. Mixing with cold oxidizing seawater provides a mechanism for precipitation of dissolved constituents in the hydrothermal fluids. Mixing may occur right at the seawater-seafloor interface for an impermeable seafloor, or in the subsurface if local sediments are saturated with seawater. As a result, Eh, pH and temperature change in the hydrothermal fluid, in pore water and in ambient seawater.\n\nOur study area lies along the southwest margin of Ambitle Island, one of the Feni islands in the southernmost island group of the Tabar-Feni chain, Papua Ž .

Hot mud pools, springs of chloride and acid sulfate waters, and a few low temperature fumaroles are present, with temperature and pH values ranging from 67 to Ž 1008C and 1.9 to 9.1, respectively Wallace et al., . 1983 .

This type of venting appears to be itinerant, with shifts in locations on the order of tens of centimeters, possibly related to tortuous migration through the surface sediment.\n\nGases that discharge through unconsolidated sediment often carry an equivalent amount of water with them. The sediment cover in Tutum Bay, however, is Ž . very thin 10-30 cm which does not allow for an extensive gas seep induced interstitial water circulation. This is in contrast to other areas of gas dis-Ž charge where sediment covers are thicker e.g., . O' Hara et al., 1994 . As a result, there is clear separation between liquid and gaseous discharges in Tutum Bay.\n\nFour locations of focused venting are present in Ž . Tutum Bay Fig. 2 . Vents 1 and 2 are single vents with hydrothermal discharge from only one orifice Ž . Fig. 3a and vent 3 is an assemblage of three vents that are very close together in an area of approxi-2 Ž . mately 2 = 2 m Fig. 3b .

Two of the on-shore hot springs, Waramung and Kapkai were sampled in addition to the Tutum Bay vents for comparison. A detailed description of these Ž sites can be found elsewhere Wallace et al., 1983;\n\n. Licence et al., 1987 .\n\nGenerally the chemical analysis of water samples is more accurate under well-controlled laboratory conditions than in the field. Some parameters, however, are unstable and, therefore, must be measured immediately after sampling. In this study we used sample containers, preservation techniques and holding times recommended for water analysis by the US Ž . Federal Registry HACH, 1992 . Vent temperatures were measured with a maximum thermometer. Due to inherent difficulties when working underwater, however, these measurements should be regarded as minimum temperatures. Vent samples were collected over a period of 10 days either by inserting a Teflon w tube as far as possible into the vent orifice or covering the vent orifice with a Teflon w funnel. Sixty-milliliter medical syringes were connected to the Teflon tube or funnel via a three-way stopcock. Using this set-up, generally 15 syringes were filled at a time and brought to the surface. While sampling vents 2, 3 and 4 minor amounts of water vapor, indicative of phase separation, were observed during filling of the syringes. On-board, aliquots were taken and immediately analyzed for pH, conductivity and alkalinity.\n\nŽ T . Total alkalinity A was measured as equivalent CaCO and expressed as HCO y , using a Hach digi-3 3 tal titrator and titrating to an endpoint of pH 4.5 Ž . HACH, 1992 . The remaining solution was filtered to -0.45 mm and subsequently separated into subsets for later analyses. Samples were stored in high density polyethylene bottles and aliquots for cation and trace element analyses were acidified with ultrapure HNO . Additionally, 60 ml aliquots of selected 3 samples were acidified with double distilled HCl Ž .\n\n3q 5q\n\n35% for determination of As rAs . The single orifice vents 1 and 2 were sampled twice and duplicate samples are indicated by a capi-tal letter following the sample number, i.e., 1B. Two of the three orifices at vent 3 were sampled, i.e., 3-1 and 3-2. A duplicate of 3-1 was taken. At vent 4, three samples were taken from three different orifices within a single mound, i.e., 4, 4B, 4C. A Ž . sample of ambient seawater SW and the samples W-1 and W-2 from the on-shore hot springs were sampled by submerging a 1-l high density polyethylene bottle. These sample were treated exactly as the Tutum Bay vent waters.\n\nSeventy-five seawater samples were collected for chemical analyses throughout the bay at the bottom, in mid-water and at the surface at varying distances from vent sites in order to reconstruct the dissipation of the hydrothermal plume and its influence on the seawater composition in Tutum Bay. Samples were pumped to the surface through a Nalgene w tube that was lowered to the depth of sampling. In order to avoid contamination, several tube volumes were discarded before taking the actual sample. Horizontal distance from vent sites was determined with ropes and buoys. At the time of sampling no water move-Ž . ment current other than that caused by the hydrothermal vents themselves was observed. These samples were filtered to -0.45 mm, acidified with ultrapure HNO for later laboratory analyses and 3 stored in high-density polyethylene bottles.\n\nThroughout the sampling period several samples of deionized water were treated in the same way as the vent samples, i.e., filtered, acidified and filled into high density polyethylene bottles. These samples were later analyzed together with the vent samples in order to check for possible contamination.\n\nMajor cations, trace elements, ultra trace elements Ž . and rare earth elements REE were determined at the Geological Survey of Canada: Li, Rb, Sr, Sb, Cs, and Tl by direct inductively coupled plasma mass Ž . spectrometry ICP-MS and Fe and Mn by chelation ICP-MS following a tenfold dilution with deionized water. REEs were analyzed by chelation ICP-MS without dilution.

The total arsenic As concentration was measured by AAS at a solution pH -2 as As-hydride and As 3q was determined by 3q Ž AAS as As -hydride, generated at pH 5 citrate .

Anion Cl , Br , SO concentrations were 4 measured at the University of Ottawa with a Dionex 100 High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph. Calibration curves were constructed using a control blank and DIONEX standard solutions. The overall completeness and quality of each analyses was checked by performing a charge balance according to: Ýan-Ž . Ž . ions meq s Ýcations meq . The difference was always less than 5%.\n\nGas samples were collected into 600-ml bottles through an inverted Teflon w funnel that was placed over the vent. In order to estimate the total gas flux from Tutum Bay, more than 100 flux measurements were carried out by timing the replacement of a known water volume from a graded cylinder. All Ž flux measurements were normalized to 1 bar i.e.,\n\n. atmospheric pressure at sea level . The chemical composition was analyzed at the Institute of Geolog-ical and Nuclear Sciences in Lower Hutt, New Ž . Zealand following Giggenbach and Goguel 1989 .\n\nThe samples collected from the submarine vents in Tutum Bay are mixtures of hydrothermal fluid and Ž . seawater Table 1 .     samples W-1 and W-2 Table 1 . The assumption of complete Mg absence in the vent fluids is most likely not correct, but given the enormous concentration difference between seawater and vent fluid, it is well within any analytical uncertainty. Another option to correct for seawater entrainment is to use Si Ž as a tracer of mixing e.g., Sedwick and Stuben, .\n\n1996 . Both alternatives have been explored in Fig. 5, where we have plotted Si and Mg 2q vs. Cl y with their respective linear regression fits. The Si values, although consistently decreasing with an increase of Ž y . seawater component i.e., Cl concentration , devi-Ž . ate barely beyond their analytical error Fig. 5b,d . Relative to ambient seawater, Mg 2q is depleted and Si is enriched and both show almost perfect correla-Ž 2 . y Ž . tion r ) 0.99 with Cl Fig. 5a,b . This high correlation, however, is due to the outlier effect Ž . Swan and Sandilands, 1995 caused by the seawater Ž . data point. Excluding this outlier Fig. 5c,d , the correlation, although, still high, is somewhat less for Ž 2 . 2q Ž 2 . Si r s 0.928 than for Mg r s 0.987 . Therefore, we assume that for our samples, Mg 2q is a more reliable tracer of mixing. The poorer correlation for Si may be due to its higher susceptibility to changes in temperature and its greater inclination to post-sampling concentration changes due to adsorption onto container walls.\n\nThe data presented in Table 2 are endmember compositions that have been calculated according to the following formula:\n\nwhere X is the calculated endmember concentrahf tion, X is the measured concentration and X is m s w the concentration in seawater. No correction of chemical composition for phase separation was attempted. In order to account for phase separation, the sampling pressure, steam composition andror reser-Ž voir conditions have to be known Henley et al., . 1984 . This information can generally be obtained when sampling in explored on-land geothermal systems, but not when sampling underwater hot-springs. The effect on chemical composition by phase separation in Tutum Bay vent waters, however, seems to be negligible. Only minor amounts of steam were observed while sampling vents 2, 3 and 4 and no steam was observed at vent 1. The impression of heavy boiling seems to be an effect caused by simultaneous discharge of non-condensable gas and water. The samples, W-1 and W-2, from the on-land thermal areas were taken from the same springs as Ž . samples WA1 and KP in Licence et al. 1987 . Their chemical composition is in excellent agreement, indicating stable conditions for these springs during more than 12 years.\n\nThe vent waters from Tutum Bay are depleted in Br y , SO 2y and Cl y relative to ambient seawater y is much less r s 0.77 and for HCO there is no 3 Ž 2 . more correlation r s 0.165 . Endmember compositions are listed in Table 2. For all samples, SO 2y 4 values are within their analytical uncertainty. Cl y and Br y , however, show a significant spread except for vent 1.\n\nThe alkaline metals Li q , Rb q and Cs q are significantly enriched over ambient seawater and nega-2q Ž . tively correlated with Mg Table 1 and Fig. 7 . Na q and K q are significantly depleted relative to 2q Ž seawater and positively correlated with Mg Table . \n\nq 1 and Fig. 7 . The Na depletion is similar to the depletion observed for Cl y . Again, excluding the seawater outlier, only Na q maintains the high degree Ž . of correlation Fig. 7 . Endmember concentrations are listed in Table 2. Except for the Na q value in sample 1, which is slightly higher than the rest, all Na q and Li q analyses are within their analytical error. The K q values fall into two distinct groups for  area A and area B, with higher concentrations in B. The Rb q and Cs q concentrations are within their analytical error, the values for area B, however, are consistently higher than those for area A.\n\nAll Tutum Bay vent waters have Ca 2q concentrations that are significantly lower than ambient seawa-Ž . ter Table 1 and Fig. 8 . Values for vents in area A and area B plot in two distinct groups that are both 2q Ž . positively correlated with Mg Fig. 8 .

The Sr concentration in vent waters is only slightly lower than in ambient seawater and there is no apparent correlation between Sr 2q and Mg 2q . Endmember concentrations for both areas are within their respective analytical uncertainty, but Ž . area A vents have slightly higher values Table 2 .\n\nThe transition metals Fe and Mn are highly en-Ž . riched over ambient seawater Table 1 and Fig. 9 .  Values for vents in area A are higher than those from area B, but both are positively correlated with Mg 2q Ž . Fig. 9 . After exclusion of the seawater value, correlation for area A drops substantially while for area B it remains high. The values for the individual areas, however, do not deviate beyond their analytical error. Endmember concentrations for both areas are within their respective analytical uncertainty, but Ž area A vents have significantly higher values Table\n\n.\n\n2 .\n\nRelative to ambient seawater, Sb, As and Tl are Ž . significantly enriched in all vents Table 1 . Arsenic concentrations are up to 275 times above seawater and it is dominantly present in its trivalent state. Endmember concentrations for Sb, As and Tl fall into groups, as observed for Ca 2q , Fe and Mn, except that here values for area B are higher than those for area A. REE concentrations in Tutum Bay vent waters are generally one order of magnitude higher than those Ž . reported for average seawater Fleet, 1984 . North Ž . American Shale Composite NASC normalized raw and endmember concentrations are plotted in Fig. 10. The pattern geometry for raw and endmember values is effectively the same, except that the endmember patterns plot slightly higher. The samples from vents Ž . Ž 1 and 3 1, 3-1 and 3-2 and their duplicates 1B and . 3-1B plot very closely together, showing the same pattern geometry: an initial drop from La to Ce followed by rise from the Ce minimum to an Eu maximum and a slight decrease towards an intermediate Lu. The pattern geometry for samples from Ž . vent 4 4, 4B and 4C is quite different; REE concentrations initially drop from La to a Ce minimum which is followed by a rise to a Dy maximum and a slight decrease towards Lu.\n\nThe chemical compositions of two samples collected from submarine gas vents in Tutum Bay are listed in Table 3. In all the gases, CO is the 2  in air-saturated water.\n\nIn addition to the sampling for chemical analyses, we also sampled a limited amount of water from each vent during a single dive for simultaneous on-board Eh and pH measurements in order to assess if there is a significant redox difference between the individual vent fluids. The pH measurement was used to monitor seawater contamination and the quality of the Eh measurement was checked against Ž the Quinhydrone solution e.g., Clark and Fritz, . 1997 . All vent fluids were found to be reducing and have similar Eh values; vent 1 sy0.175 V, vent 2 sy0.171 V, vent 3 sy0.173 V and vent 4 s y0.175 V. These values are similar to those ob-\n\nThe contour maps of the hydrothermal component Ž concentration in Tutum Bay seawater Figs. 12 and . 13 were constructed using silica as a tracer and assuming conservative behavior and linear mixing.

It is important, however, to realize that the fluid dissipation model presented in Figs. 12 and 13 is only a snapshot in space and time of a very dynamic system. At times discharge rates may be much higher or lower resulting in a different concentration of hydrothermal component. Nearshore currents, although none were noticed while sampling, may be present at other times, modifying the plume dispersion pattern.\n\nOf potentially poisonous trace metals that are released into Tutum Bay, only arsenic has a significantly higher concentration than seawater. In particular, AsIII-compounds are known to have a genotoxic Ž . potential Gebel et al., 1997 . The hydrothermal fluids contain extremely high arsenic concentrations of more than 11 mmol and the combined discharge of all vents is estimated to be more than 1500 g of arsenic per day into an area of approximately 50 m by 100 m with an average depth of 6 m. These values are the highest arsenic concentration reported from any marine setting, including black smoker fluids from mid-ocean ridges. Despite the amount of arsenic released into the bay, corals, clams and fish do not show any direct response to the elevated values. Fish have been observed to hover over vent orifices, bathing in the hydrothermal fluid. The diversity and health of the coral reef is indiscernible from reefs that are not exposed to hydrothermal Ž . discharge. Pichler et al. for submission analyzed the skeletons of scleractinian corals and the shells of Tridacna gigas clams but they did not find elevated concentrations of arsenic or other trace metals when compared to specimens collected from outside Tutum Bay.\n\nTwo mechanisms efficiently control and buffer Ž . the arsenic concentration: 1 dilution by seawater Ž . and 2 incorporation in and adsorption on Feoxyhydroxides that precipitate when the hydrothermal fluids mix with ambient seawater. The hydrothermal fluids have a pH of ; 6 and are slightly reducing. Under these conditions Mn stays in its reduced form and, therefore, in solution, whereas As is rapidly oxidized and scavenged by Fe-oxyhydroxides. Oxidation of As 3q to its pentavalent state significantly decreases its reactivity and genotoxicity Ž . Gebel et al., 1997 . The Fe-oxyhydroxides that pre-cipitate in Tutum Bay can contain more than 50 000 Ž . ppm As Pichler and Dix, 1996;Pichler et al., 1996 and are by an order of magnitude the highest As values found in a natural system.\n\nThe discharge composition of thermal springs is Ž . controlled by two sets of processes: 1 deep reser-Ž voir conditions deep reservoirs reaction zone im-. Ž . mediately above the heat source , and 2 secondary processes during ascent. In the deep reservoir, host rock composition, temperature, direct magmatic contributions and residence time are the controlling factors. During ascent, a drop in pressure and temperature can initiate phase separation and mineral precipitation, causing a dramatic change in fluid composition. Mixing with other hydrothermal fluids andror groundwater is possible at any depth. In near-shore and submarine environments, mixing with seawater cannot be ruled out. The chemical composition of a hydrothermal fluid, sampled at the surface, generally contains an imprint of its subsurface history. Chemi-Ž . cally inert constituents tracers provide information about their source, whereas chemically reactive Ž . species geoindicators record physicochemical Ž changes e.g., Ellis and Mahon, 1977;Giggenbach, . 1991;Nicholson, 1992 . Examples of widely used solute tracers and geoindicators are Cl, B, Li, Rb, Cs and Na, K, Mg, Ca, SiO , respectively. The bound-2 ary between the two groups, however, is not rigid and depending on the physicochemical conditions of the hydrothermal system, tracers may participate in chemical reactions and geoindicators can behave inertly.\n\nIn Tutum Bay waters, the ratios of all alkalis, except for Li, are almost identical to those in samples W-1 and W-2. This would argue that at least some of the relative Li increase has to be attributed to shallow leaching, a proposition contrary to the belief that Li is the alkali probably least affected by Ž . secondary processes e.g., Giggenbach, 1991 . These elements are added to the hydrothermal fluid under deep reservoir conditions due to water-rock interaction and they are generally not affected by shallow processes. All samples plot away from the compositional field of crustal rocks, indicating that secondary\n\n. trivalent state Goldberg et al., 1963 . In addition, Ce Ž forms colloidal ceric hydroxide Carpenter and Grant, . 1967 which is readily scavenged by Fe-oxyhydroxides. The slight difference in pattern geometry between area A and B could be caused as well by varying degrees of subsurface mixing. This, however, does not account for the difference in vent 2 samples.\n\nA fluid in a hydrothermal system may be derived from any or any combination of the following sources: meteoric water, seawater, connate water, magmatic water and juvenile water. Mixing of waters from different sources affects many aspects of the geochemistry of a hydrothermal system, such as chemical composition, isotopic composition, temperature profile and gas content. Deep sea hydrothermal systems active along mid-oceanic ridges, in back-arc basins and on the flanks of seamounts likely derive all their fluid from seawater, although a minor magmatic contribution cannot be completely ruled out Ž . De Ronde, 1995 . In contrast, on-land hydrothermal areas derive most of their fluid from meteoric sources, but a significant magmatic contribution is likely Ž . e.g., Giggenbach, 1992 . Determination of the fluid origin is an important step in order to determine subsurface processes and reservoir conditions. While the source determination is relatively straightforward in deep marine and inland settings, the subject be-Ž comes more complex in coastal regions off-shore . and on-shore where seawater incursion can significantly alter the fluid composition in a hydrothermal system. For example, seawater mixing is present in Ž . Ž . the Savusava Fiji , Puna Hawaii and Reykjanes Ž . Ž . Iceland hydrothermal systems Nicholson, 1992 . Similarly, meteoric water may be the source for submarine hydrothermal systems in coastal areas where a steep topography and ample supply of rain-Ž water can force the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater-. Ž seawater boundary substantially offshore Nahm, . 1966;Chuck, 1967 . Tropical and subtropical islandarc volcanoes are good examples for these conditions. Subsurface sealing of a hydrothermal system, Ž as argued for White Island, New Zealand Giggen-   Nicholson, 1992 , are quite different from those caused by seawater mixing. Their origin and physicochemical history can be explored in a Cl, Ž SO and HCO ternary diagram e.g., Chang, 1984; 4 3 Giggenbach, 1991;Nicholson, 1992;Giggenbach, . 1997 . Hydrothermal waters are generally divided into neutral chloride, acid sulfate and bicarbonate waters, but mixtures between the individual groups Ž . are common Fig. 15 . Tutum Bay vents plot close to the ÝCO corner along the upper boundary for steam 3 heated waters. Waters that plot in this area generally form by underground absorption of vapors separated from a deeper neutral chloride water into cooler ground water, where based on the gas content of the vapor and redox conditions either acid sulfate or Ž bicarbonate waters are formed e.g., Ellis and Mahon, 1977;Henley and Ellis, 1983;Hedenquist, 1990; .  Nicholson, 1992 . In the case of the Tutum Bay samples, however, Cl cannot be applied successfully because the concentration gradient between seawater and hydrothermal fluid is too large and, therefore, the error introduced due to seawater contamination is substantial. Boron, on the other hand, seems to be an excellent tracer for subsurface conditions at Ambitle Island. The subsurface flow direction from W-2 over W-1 to Tutum Bay is indicated by decreasing B and alkali contents Ž . graphic location. The Tutum Bay vents are topographically lowest and furthest away from the center of the hydrothermal system, whereas the sample Ž . from the Kapkai thermal area W-2 is relatively Ž . higher approximately 30 m above sea level and closer. The linear regression lines for Rb and Cs and for Na and K converge almost exactly at the point Ž . where they intercept the x-axis Fig. 16 . Assuming that the regression lines represent mixing between deep neutral chloride and shallow bicarbonate water, the intercept of the x-or y-axis represents one endmember. This endmember, if based on Rb and Cs, would have a boron excess, of approximately 0.27 mmol, whereas the one based on Li would have Ž . a Li excess of approximately 0.04 mmol Fig. 16 . The former is a much more likely alternative for a process that forms bicarbonate water. Boron occurs Ž . largely as boric acid H BO , its volatile form, and 3 3 can be easily carried in the vapor phase even at Ž . lower temperatures Tonani, 1970 . Using a simple mass balance equation: C s xC q yC 3 Ž . TBVF DR BW where C is the average boron concentration in TBVF Tutum Bay vent fluids, C is the estimated boron DR concentration in the deep reservoir fluid and C is BW the calculated boron concentration in the bicarbonate water. Based on the 0.27 mmol boron excess, bicarbonate and chloride water fractions were calculated to be 0.89 and 0.11, respectively. Based on the Na-K boron excess, bicarbonate and chloride water fractions would be approximately 0.93 and 0.07, respectively. The deep reservoir fraction, present in Tutum Bay samples, is in good agreement with that found in waters of similar origin in other hydrother-Ž . mal systems. Hedenquist 1990 , for example, estimated that at the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal system, most of the marginal upflow mixes with steam-heated waters and only a small amount of Ž . deep fluid ; 10% rises to the surface.\n\nThe division into area A and B that was initially based solely on geographic location has been reinforced by chemical composition. Although the chemical composition of all Tutum Bay vents is quite alike, compared to area A, area B vents have higher K, Rb, Sb, Cs, Tl, and As and lower Ca, Li, Mn, Fe, Ž . and Sr concentrations Table 2 . This seems to be directly related to the composition of samples W-1 and W-2 that also have elevated concentrations of K, Rb, Sb, Cs, Tl, and As and lower Ca, Li, Mn, Fe, Ž . and Sr concentrations Tables 1 and 2 . Thus the slight chemical difference in area A and B vents may be attributed to varying subsurface addition of a hydrothermal fluid similar in composition to W-1 and W-2.\n\nSolute geothermometers, such as listed in Table 4, provide powerful tools to estimate subsurface conditions. Their successful application has been extensively discussed in the geothermal literature and Ž . relies on five basic assumptions: 1 exclusively Ž . temperature dependent mineral-fluid reaction; 2 Ž . abundance of the mineral andror solute; 3 chemi-Ž . Ž . cal equilibrium; 4 no re-equilibration; and 5 no Ž . mixing or dilution Nicholson, 1992 . The no mixing or dilution assumption, however, can be circumvented if their extent andror influence on solute Ž . Ž . ratios e.g., NarK is known see above .\n\nThe calculated temperatures in Table 4 differ quite drastically. This is not surprising considering that most problems in the use of geothermometers arise from application to unsuitable samples. Different geothermometers, however, record different equilibria and disagreement does not immediately eliminate the use of one or the other. Careful application and evaluation of calculated temperatures may provide important clues to the overall hydrology of the hydrothermal system.\n\nThe temperatures calculated with the silica Ž . geothermometers Fournier, 1977 are too low to represent a reliable estimate of the reservoir condition. This is to be expected in particular for the samples W-1 and W-2, since these springs are fed from reservoirs with temperatures in excess of ; 2308C and have, therefore, lost some of their initial silica due to precipitation of quartz, chalcedony, or Ž amorphous silica during ascent Rimstidt and Barnes, . 1980;Fournier, 1985 . The application of the silica Ž . thermometer to Tutum Bay samples V-1 to V-4 is problematic because they are a mixture of at least two fluids and the thermometer is based on absolute silica concentration.\n\nThe quality of reservoir temperatures calculated with the thermometers listed in\n\nTable 4 depends ( ) T. Pichler et al.r Marine Chemistry 64 1999 229-252 248 strongly on the equilibrium between fluid and host rock lithology. Attainment of deep reservoir equilibrium has been verified for samples W-1 and W-2 based on their relative Na, K and Mg concentrations Ž . e.g., Giggenbach, 1988 . Unfortunately, this method cannot be directly applied to the Tutum Bay samples because they have zero-Mg by definition, but equilibrium conditions would apply for Mg concentrations between approximately 0.00083 and 0.083 mmol. Temperatures obtained from the LirMg and NarLi thermometers are substantially lower than Ž those from the other ionic solute thermometers Ta-. ble 4 . Exchange reactions with Mg seem to be expeditious at lower temperatures and Mg-based thermometers may, therefore, record the last equilib-Ž . rium prior to discharge e.g., Nicholson, 1992 . The low LirMg temperature, however, is in contrast with the KrMg thermometer. Considering that the relative Mg, Na and K concentrations of W-1 and W-2 indicate deep reservoir equilibrium, it is rather the Li concentration that must have been affected during ascent or at a shallower level. The temperatures obtained from KrMg, NarK and Na-K-Ca are in good agreement and indicate a reservoir temperature of approximately 3008C. NarK temperatures are slightly lower, which is to be expected given the slightly peripheral location of the thermal areas. The NarK ratio of a hydrothermal fluid generally in-Ž . creases during lateral flow Ellis and Mahon, 1977 . The Tutum Bay samples, although mixed with water of a different origin, still carry a significant NarK imprint of the deep reservoir. Temperatures for vents 1, 2 and 3 are slightly lower, while vent 4 has\n\n. identical temperatures to W-1 and W-2 Table 4 . This would confirm that the discharge from vent 4 has a relatively greater proportion of the deep reser-Ž . voir fluid see above . The notable disagreement between Tutum Bay and on-land Na-K-Ca temperatures is a result of the high pCO and, therefore, 2 high Ca concentration in Tutum Bay fluids.\n\nThe NarLi temperatures obtained for Tutum Bay samples may be representative of shallow reservoir conditions that post date mixing between deep reservoir and bicarbonate fluid. When compared to Mg, Na, K, Rb and Cs, Li seems to be the element most affected by shallow reservoir processes, but the calculated NarLi temperatures appear to be in good agreement with theoretical considerations. Let us consider one more time the process that leads to the formation of a CO or bicarbonate water. Isenthalpic 2 expansion of steam, separated from a deeper liquid phase to close to atmospheric pressure, is accompa-Ž nied by a drop in temperature to about 1608C Gig-. genbach, 1997 . Bicarbonate waters formed due to interaction between groundwater and this 1608C steam, generally have temperatures in the vicinity of Ž 1508C e.g., Cioni and D'Amore, 1984;Hedenquist, . 1990 . Mixing of this 1508C bicarbonate water with a 3008C deep reservoir fluid at a ratio of ; 9:1, as Ž . obtained from the boron mixing model see above , leads to a final shallow reservoir temperature of 1658C which is in perfect agreement with the calcu-Ž . lated NarLi temperatures Table 4 .\n\nAdditional insight into potential processes controlling the fluid composition and subsurface processes may be provided by the chemical composition of the ( ) T. Pichler et al.r Marine Chemistry 64 1999 229-252 249 gases, as listed in Table 3. An examination of the gases is carried out in terms of relative concentra-Ž . tions of N c , He and CO contents. On the basis of 2 2 gas discharges from a wide range of tectonic environments, the compositions of volcanic and geothermal vapors were found to represent essentially mixtures of two endmember components: a mantle derived component, very low in N with CO rHe 2 2 ratios of 20 000 to 40 000, and an arc-type component with much higher CO rHe ratios of ) 10 6 and 2 Ž a quite uniform CO rN ratios of 100 \" 60 Gig-2 2\n\n. genbach, 1995 .\n\nThe data points for the gases plot at the upper boundary of the compositional area outlined for vol-Ž . canic and geothermal vapors Fig. 17  Assuming equilibration of the gases dissolved in a liquid phase and preservation of equilibrium with air.

Depth of separation, therefore, should be at approximately 1000 m, provided that the deep reservoir fluid is on the boiling curve. These CH -CO equilibrium tem-4 2 peratures are in good agreement with reservoir fluid estimates based on the MgrLi, NarK and Na-K-Ca Ž . solute geothermometers Table 4 .\n\nThe shallow-water hydrothermal fluids from Tutum Bay seem to be dominantly of meteoric origin, although they discharge in a marine environment.\n\nŽ . This confirms the work of Pichler and Dix 1996 who, based on fluid inclusions and d 18 O in hydrothermal aragonite, also proposed their meteoric origin. Their final chemical composition is the out-Ž come of a two-or possibly three-step process Fig.\n\n. The definite chemical composition of Tutum Bay vent fluids may be slightly different from the values reported in Table 2, because of phase separation during ascent from the shallow reservoir and Mgcorrection for seawater contamination. Thermometry and mixing calculations, however, are not affected, because they are based on element ratios rather than on absolute concentrations.\n\nunit mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol mmol a Mg concentration for these samples is 0 by convention."
