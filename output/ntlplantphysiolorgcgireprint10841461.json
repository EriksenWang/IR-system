In the present study, we analyzed the genomic region between ORF839 and ccmK in an attempt to identify nove1 genes involved in the ability of Syneckococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 to grow under various levels of CO,.\n\nCultures of Syneckococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 and the mutants thereof were grown in BGll medium (Stanier et al., 1971) supplemented with 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, at 30°C. The cultures were aerated with high (5% [v/vl CO, in air) or low CO, (1:l mixture of air with C0,-free air) as previously described (Marcus et al., 1986). Genomic DNA was isolated as described elsewhere (Friedberg et al., 19891, and standard recombinant DNA techniques  (Sambrook et al., 1989) were used for cloning and Southern, northern, and sequence analyses. The latter was performed with the aid of the Sequenase kit (version 2.0, United States Biochemical). Eschevickia coli (strain DH5a) were grown on LB medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) supplemented with either kanamycin (50 pg/mL) or ampicillin (50 pg/mL) when required.\n\nIn Figure 1 we present a schematic map of the genomic region of rbcLS in Syneckococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 constructed on the basis of the present and earlier studies (Kaplan et al., 1994). The analysis indicated that this region contains genes essential for growth under different CO, concentrations as well as other genes that are apparently not involved in this ability. The mutants used here were obtained following the insertion of nptII (encoding Kn') in the sites indicated in the figure.

ORF236, ORF78 (ccmn, ORF286 (chlL), and ORF466 (chlN) were identified and analyzed in the present study. Modification of ndhB (Marco et al., 1993), ORF839 (Kaplan et al., 1994), ccmK, ccmL, ccmM (Price et al., 1993), ccmN (Friedberg et al., 1989), cem0 (Marco et ai., 1994), rbcS (Schwarz et al., 1992b), purK (Schwarz et al., 1992a), and icfA (Fukuzawa et al., 1992) altered the ability of the respective mutants to grow under various levels of CO,. Modification of rotA, involved in protein folding, resulted in merodiploids capable of growing under high and low CO, (Hassidim et al., 1992).

The plasmid obtained, designated pSKSal, was used to construct the plasmids pSKM3Kn and pSKC2Kn (Fig. 2). The pSKM3Kn was obtained following digestion of pSKSal with EcoRI and ligation with a 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment bearing nptll. The pSKC2Kn was obtained following digestion of pSKSal with HindIII, eliminating the right side of the insert upon selfligation. The 0.6-kb PstI fragment in the new plasmid was replaced with a 1.3-kb PstI fragment bearing nptll. The Kn' mutants M3 and C2 were obtained following transformation of the wild type with linearized fragments of pSKM3Kn and pSKC2Kn digested with KpnI or EagI, respectively .\n\nA 2.5-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment (subcloned from pE12) was cloned in a modified Bluescript SK in which the EcoRV-HincII polylinker fragment was deleted. The plasmid obtained was used to construct two other plasmids. In pSKC3Kn (Fig. 2) nptll was inserted in the genomic EcoRV site, and in pSKC4Kn (Fig. 2) the 0.3-kb PstI fragment was replaced with a 1.3-kb PstI bearing nptll. The Kn' mutants C3 and C4 were obtained following transformation of the wild type with fragments of pSKC3Kn (digested with EcoRI and XbaI) and pSKC4Kn (digested with EcoRV and EagI), respectively .\n\nFollowing transformation, the cells were grown for 24 h in liquid BGll medium aerated with 5% CO, and then spread on agar plates containing BGll supplemented with kanamycin (25 pg/mL). The plates were placed in closed, illuminated chambers aerated with high or low levels of  CO 2 . A colony, designated M3, capable of growing under high but not low CO 2 was selected for further analysis.\n\nColonies of mutants C2, C3, and C4 grew in the presence of high and low CO 2 . The rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution as a function of the concentration of Ci and the ability of the cells to accumulate Ci internally were determined using the oxygen electrode and the filtering centrifugation techniques previously described (Kaplan et al., 1988;Schwarz et al., 1988). Carboxysomes were isolated by a modification of the technique developed by Price et al. (1992). The cells were harvested, resuspended in a breaking buffer (20 mM Tes-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 5 mM EDTA), washed, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM caproic acid, and 1 mM benzamidine. The cells were then broken with acid-pretreated glass beads (106 jam; Sigma) in a Brown (Stuttgart, Germany) sonicator for 30 s. The polypeptide patterns of the carboxysome-enriched frac-tions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described by Schagger and von Jagow (1987). Western analyses were performed with the aid of antibodies raised against the cyanobacterial small subunit of Rubisco (kindly provided by Dr. S. Gutteridge) and the large subunit of Rubisco isolated from spinach (kindly provided by Dr. R. Nechustai).\n\nThe electron microscopic analyses were performed as described by Orus et al. (1992). The cells were harvested and washed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and fixed in 3.1% glutaraldehyde (in phosphate buffer) for 3 h at 4°C. Samples were placed in 4% agar in phosphate buffer. Postfixation was made on 1-to 2-mm agar blocks using osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4°C. Samples were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin (Spurr, 1969), sectioned in an ultracut E Reicher-Jung (Heidelberg, Germany) ultratome, and stained with saturated uranyl acetate for 6 min and lead citrate for 2 min under anaerobic conditions. The electron micrographs were taken in a Jeol 100B electron microscope.\n\nConfirmation that the Kn r cartridge was inserted in the desired site within the genome of M3 was obtained by sequence and Southern analyses and transformation. A similar approach was applied in the cases of mutants C2, C3, and C4, but we did not pursue these experiments because these mutants did not exhibit a selectable phenotype under the growth conditions used here (see below). The genomic DNA of M3 was digested with EcoRV and Eag\\ (an Eagl site is located within ndhB [Marco et al., 1993]) and separated on an agarose gel, and the 5-to 7-kb region was isolated and cloned in Bluescript SK, digested with the same enzymes. Competent cells of E. coli were transformed with this minilibrary and Kn r clones were isolated. Oligonucleotides (designed according to the known sequence of the 5' and 3' ends of the Kn r cartridge) were used to analyze the sequence at the insertion site of the Kn r cartridge. The sequence obtained was identical with that of the wild type near (and including) the EcoRI site (see Fig. 8, below), confirming that the Kn r cassette was inserted in the desired site. A B Figure 5. Electron micrographs of high-CO 2 -grown Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (A) and mutant M3 (B). The bar indicates 0.1 /j.m.\n\nTransformation of mutant M3 with the 3.5-kb Sail fragment (used to obtain pSKM3Kn, Fig. 2) resulted in cells capable of growing under low CO 2 but only in the absence of kanamycin. These data provided supporting evidence that the high-CO 2 -requiring phenotype of M3 resulted from a modification of this region.\n\nSouthern analyses were performed on DNA isolated from the wild type and mutant M3 (Fig. 3). The results indicated that mutant M3 was obtained following a double crossover recombination event and complete segregation.\n\nThe response of the Kn r mutants to ambient concentration of CO 2 was initially determined in growth experiments. Regardless of the presence of kanamycin, mutant M3 grew like the wild type under high CO 2 but was unable to grow under low CO 2 (not shown) as reported in the cases of other high-CO 2 -requiring mutants of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (Marcus et al., 1986). Mutants C2, C3, and C4 exhibited the same growth characteristics as the wild type in the presence of either high or low CO 2 (not shown).\n\nThe phenotype of M3 is most probably attributable to the very low apparent photosynthetic affinity, 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 4). Filtering centrifugation experiments (Kaplan et al., 1988) demonstrated that M3 is able to accumulate Ci within the cell at least as efficiently as the wild type but is defective in its ability to utilize the internal Ci pool for photosynthesis (not shown). Similar results were reported for several other high-CO 2 -requiring mutants of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (Marcus et al., 1986;Price and Badger, 1989;Kaplan et al., 1990Kaplan et al., , 1991Kaplan et al., , 1994)).\n\nThe electron micrograph of the wild type (Fig. 5A) showed normal carboxysomes, whereas the mutant M3 (Fig. 5B) exhibited only small bodies concentrically arranged, presumably on the thylakoid membranes. Identical structures were also observed in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 grown under conditions of low iron concentration. It was suggested that these structures are glycogen bodies that accumulate in the cell because of the stress conditions (Sherman and Sherman, 1983). Earlier studies indicated that some of the high-CO 2 -requiring mutants possess different forms of aberrant carboxysomes (Friedberg et al., 1989;Orus et al., 1992). Figure 5 shows that this is also the case for mutant M3. Normal carboxysomes were not detected in the mutant. It is important to note that the various types of carboxysomes reported in different mutants and that are referred to as defective carboxysomes may be stages in normal carboxysomal biogenesis. They are also detected in the wild type, although not as frequently as in the mutants.\n\nIt was important to test whether mutant M3 exhibited a modified polypeptide pattern of carboxysome-enriched fractions. The analysis (Fig. 6A) showed a decrease in the levels of several polypeptides in M3, compared to the wild type, particularly the 48-and 52-kD polypeptides. In contrast, the amounts of several other polypeptides such as in the 45-and 15-kD regions were similar in the wild type and the mutant. The 48-kD polypeptide was not identified, but, as suggested by Price et al. (1992), it might be the gene product of ccmM (Fig. 1). Inactivation of ccmM resulted in a high-CO 2 -requiring phenotype and the appearance of abnormal carboxysomes (Friedberg et al., 1989;Price et al., 1993). Since the cyanobacterial Rubisco is mainly confined to the carboxysomes (Codd, 1988;McKay et al., 1992) and the mutant M3 contains defective carboxysomes, it is possible that the 52-kD polypeptide is the large subunit of Rubisco. Western analyses were performed using antibodies raised against the large subunit of Rubisco from spinach and the small subunit from cyanobacteria. The data (Fig. 6B) indicated that the 52-kD polypeptide was indeed the large subunit of Rubisco and that the amount of the large subunit and small subunit were much larger in the carboxysomal fractions isolated from the wild-type cells. It was possible that the aberrant nature of the carboxysomes in the mutant resulted in partial displacement of Rubisco from the carboxysomes, leading to a higher amount of Rubisco in the supernatant. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western analyses of acetone precipitates of supernatant proteins. The results obtained (not shown) were the reverse of those presented in Figure 6, i.e. a larger amount of Rubisco subunits in the supernatant from mutant M3.\n\nAlthough the number of carboxysomes increased significantly following transfer from high to low CO 2 (Turpin et al., 1984;McKay et al., 1992), we could not detect a significant effect of the concentration of CO 2 during growth on the polypeptide patterns of wild-type cells (not shown). This is consistent with the results of Price et al. (1992).\n\nMeasurements of the activation state of Rubisco in situ in some of the mutants that possess aberrant carboxysomes indicated that the enzyme was in a low state of activation when mutant cells were exposed to low CO 2 (Schwarz et al., 1992b). Exposure of the cells to high CO 2 resulted in a significant increase in the activity of Rubisco. It was therefore suggested that the phenotype of these mutants resulted from an inactivated state of Rubisco when the cells were exposed to low CO 2 . This may be due to improper organization of Rubisco and of carbonic anhydrase within the carboxysomes (Schwarz et al., 1992b(Schwarz et al., , 1995)). We did not determine the state of activation of Rubisco in M3. However, since the physiological and structural characteristics of mutant M3 (high-CO 2 -requiring, low apparent photosynthetic affinity for external Ci, normal Ci uptake, and defective carboxysomes) are similar to those of the other defective carboxysome-containing mutants, it is likely that the high-CO 2 -requiring phenotype of M3 is also due to an inactive state of Rubisco.\n\nFigure 7 presents the DNA sequence of the relevant 4717-bp BspDl-EagI fragment located 4.1 kb upstream of the translation start codon of rbcL. The analysis revealed the presence of several major ORFs in the strand encoding rbcLS (Fig. 1) and a few smaller ORFs on this and on the reverse strand. This sequence starts in the C terminus region of ORF839 (GenBank accession No. X72391). The latter contains a clear motif of a His kinase of the type involved in the sensing of environmental stimuli in bacteria (Schwarz et al., 1994). The N terminus of this ORF (not shown) is highly homologous to topA, encoding topoisomerase I in £. coli (Kaplan et al., 1994;Schwarz et al., 1994;C. Gabay and A. Kaplan, unpublished data). ORF236 encodes a putative Pro-rich (12.7%) polypeptide. A search of the data base showed some homology of ORF236 with several Pro-rich proteins (not shown).

(Figure begins on facing page.) The D N A sequence of the relevant BspDI-Eagl genomic fragment in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. The Eagl site, at the 3' end of this sequence, is located 4.1 kb upstream of the translation start codon of rbcL. The first 461 nucleotides of this sequence are located at the end of sequence X72391 (accession number in CenBank); that of accession No. M67694 starts in position 456 and ends in the BspHl site position 4315. The beginning of sequence M96929 (Price et al., 1993) starts in position 3726. The sites where the Kn' cartridge was inserted in mutants C2 (substitution of the 0.6-kb Pstl fragment, positions 456-1 054), M 3 (EcoRI, position 1613), C3 (EcoRV, position 2563), and C4 (substitution of the 0.3-kb Pstl fragment, positions 3726-4027) are underlined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the end of ORF839 (C.\n\nGabay, unpublished data), ORF236, ORF78, ORF286, ORF466, and the beginning of ccmK are also presented.\n\never, the possible role of ORF236 is not known, since substitution of the 0.6-kb PstI fragment in its N terminus with the Kn' cartridge (mutant C2) did not result in selectable phenotype (other than Kn') under our growth conditions. Furthermore, we were not able to identify a transcript originating from ORF236. Modification of the genomic region of the EcoRI site (position 1613) resulted in the high-C0,-requiring mutant M3, indicating that this region is essential for the ability of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 to grow under a low leve1 of CO,. The ORFs located between ORF466 and rbcLS were designated ccmK-O (Fig. l), since they are apparently involved in the proper operation of the C0,-concentrating mechanism. Therefore, we designated this region ccm], presented as ORF78. The EcoRI site is located within severa1 possible ORFs but the initiation codon was not determined. The ccmJ is presented as ORF78 (from the TTG at position 1440, see Gold and Stormo, 1987) in Figures 1 and 7. A search of the data bases indicated some homology (28%) between ccm] and csoS1, encoding a putative carboxysomal shell polypeptide in Thiobacillus neapolitanus (English et al., 1994). Moreover, recent data from the laboratory of Dr. J.M. Shively demonstrated that a fragment bearing csoS2 hybridized with the genomic region of ccm] (J.M. Shively, personal communication). These data may indicate that ccmJ is involved in the formation of the carboxysomal shell in Synechococcus. Nevertheless, it is important to note that we could not detect significant differences between the polypeptide pattern of the wild type and mutant M3 at approximately 7 to 10 kD (the predicted size of the gene product of ccmn and northern analysis did not detect a transcript originating from this region.\n\nFigure 8A presents the alignment of ORF286 with chlL (frxC) from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The alignment of the latter with chlL from other organisms has already been reported (Fujita et al., 1991;Ogura et al., 1992). The analysis in Figure 8A showed 86.7% identity over the entire range including the ATP-binding domain GKGGIGKS (positions 7-14) and the four Cys's (positions 36, 83, 95, and 129) thought to be involved in electron transfer (Fujita et al., 1991). It is therefore suggested that ORF286 is the chlL of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Interestingly, chlL is also highly homologous to nifH (Fujita et al., 1991), which is involved in nitrogen fixation, but the significance of this homology is poorly understood.\n\nORF466 is located 64 bp downstream of the termination codon of ORF286. Figure 8B shows the alignment of ORF466 with chlN (ORF469) from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The alignment of the latter with ORF467 in Plectonema boryanum, chlN in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, ORF465 in liverworth, and gidA in pine, encoding Pchlide reductase, has already been reported (Fujita et al., 1993). On the basis A Figure 8. Alignment of the amino acid sequence deduced for ORF286 (A) and ORF466 (6) in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (Fig. 7) with chlL and chlN, respectively, from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Ogura et al., 1992). ldentical amino acids are indicated by *.\n\nof this homology (78.8% identity over the first 463 amino acids, Fig. 8B) we suggest that ORF466 might encode the homologous polypeptide in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. chlL and chlN (encoding Pchlide reductase) are thought to be involved in Chl biosynthesis in the dark. This has been deduced from the accumulation of Pchlide a n d the inhibition of Chl synthesis in the d a r k in P. boryanum and Syneckocystis sp.

PCC 7942 d i d not result in a selectable phenotype (other than Kn') under the various growth conditions (including different CO, concentrations b u t continuous light) used here. These data may indicate that ORF286 and ORF466 are not essential i n Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, an organism unable to grow in the d a r k at the expense of exogenously supplied carbohydrates.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1995 American Society of Plant Biologists.
