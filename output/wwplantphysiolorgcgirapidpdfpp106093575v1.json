    "abstract": "Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein implicated in many aspects of ribosomal biogenesis, including early events such as processing of the large 35S preribosomal RNA. We found that that the Arabidopsis parallel1 (parl1) mutant, originally identified by its aberrant leaf venation, corresponds to the Arabidopsis nucleolin gene. parl1 mutants display parallel leaf venation, aberrant localization of the provascular marker Athb8:GUS and the auxin-sensitive reporter DR5:GUS, and auxin-dependent growth defects. PARL1 is highly similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleolin NUCLEAR SIGNAL RECOGNITION 1 (NSR1) multifunctional protein; the Arabidopsis PARL1 gene can rescue growth defects of yeast nsr1 null mutants. This suggests that PARL1 protein may have roles similar to those of the yeast nucleolin in nuclear signal recognition, ribosomal processing and ribosomal subunit accumulation. Based on the range of auxin-related defects in parl1 mutants, we propose that auxin-dependent organ growth and patterning is highly sensitive to the efficiency of nucleolindependent ribosomal processing.\n2005).",
    "full_text": "In eukaryotes, protein translation is accomplished by ribosomes that are synthesized in a subnuclear structure, called the nucleolus. Ribosomal biogenesis begins with the synthesis and processing of a large pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and ends with ribosomal subunit assembly by the loading of ribosomal proteins onto mature rRNA and their subsequent transport into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Woolford and Warner, 1991;Venema and Tollervey, 1999;Fromont-Racine et al., 2003;Nazar, 2004). The abundant nucleololar protein nucleolin is involved in many aspects of ribosomal biogenesis, including chromatin decondensation of ribosomal DNA, rDNA transcription, rRNA processing and maturation, ribosomal assembly, and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of ribosomes (for review see Tuteja and Tuteja, 1998;Ginisty et al., 1999). Nucleolin is found in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to mammals.\n\nIn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nucleolin was first identified for its ability to bind nuclear localization signals and dubbed NUCLEAR SIGNAL RECOGNITION1 (NSR1) (Lee et al., 1991). NSR1 has been suggested to bind to ribosomal proteins and pre-rRNA to facilitate their interaction (Xue and Mélèse, 1994).\n\nMutations in yeast NSR1 result in slow growth, accumulation of unprocessed 35S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), and subsequent reduction in 40S ribosomal subunits (Kondo and Inouye, 1992;Lee et al., 1992).\n\nMutations in nucleolins of plants have not been reported previously. However, nucleolin has been shown to be light regulated and to have DNA helicase and ATPase activity in Pisum sativum (Tong et al., 1997;Reichler et al., 2001;Nasirudin et al., 2005), to be cell-cycle regulated in Medicago sativa (Bögre et al., 1996), and to be part of a complex responsible for rRNA binding and in vitro pre-rRNA processing in Arabidopsis thaliana (Sáez-Vasquez et al., 2004). While the phenotypic consequences of mutations in nucleolin proteins have not been described, those of ribosomal proteins have been reported in Arabidopsis. The pointed leaf1 (pfl1)/ribosomal proteinS18 (rps18), pointed leaf2 (pfl2)/ribosomal proteinS13 (rps13), and arabidopsis minute-like1 (aml1)/ribosomal proteinS5 (rps5) mutants display developmental defects including growth retardation, narrow leaves with reductions in the palisade mesophyll layer, reduced fertility, and cotyledon vascular pattern defects (Van Lijsebettens et al., 1994;Ito et al., 2000;Weijers et al., 2001). Similar defects were exhibited in the recently described short valve1 (stv1)/ribosomal protein L24 (rpl24), though this mutant additionally displayed variable apical-basal gynoecium patterning defects that were not observed in pfl1/rps18, pfl2/rps13, aml/rps5 mutants. The defects of stv1/rpl24 mutants were proposed to be auxin-mediated through perturbations in the translation re-initiation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcripts, such as ETTIN (ETT)/ARF3 and MONOPTEROS (MP)/ARF5 (Nishimura et al., Interestingly, mutations in the auxin response genes ETT/ARF3 and MP/ARF5 also have vein pattern defects (Sessions and Zambryski, 1995;Przemeck et al., 1996;Sessions et al., 1997;Hardtke and Berleth, 1998;Nemhauser et al., 2000).\n\nPromotion of vein patterning and differentiation is known to involve the plant hormone auxin. Auxin's role in providing positional information for vein formation is supported by the expression pattern of DR5 auxin-responsive reporter genes and PIN1, the effects of exogenously applied polar auxin transport inhibitors (Mattsson et al., 1999, Sieburth, 1999;Mattsson et al., 2003;Scarpella et al., 2006), and a plethora of mutants with aberrant vascular anatomy and auxin physiology (reviewed in Scarpella and Meijer, 2004). However, several vascular pattern genes have been identified that appear not to be involved directly in auxin signaling, but instead in the basic machinery that facilitates or regulates membrane traffic, cell cycle, and other cellular processes. Mutations in COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN1 (CVP1), COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN2 (CVP2), and VARICOSE (VCS) have normal auxin sensitivity, but display aberrant vein patterns (Carland et al., 1999(Carland et al., , 2002;;Carland and Nelson, 2004;Deyholos et al., 2003) associated in the first two cases with defects in sterol and phosphoinositol metabolism, and may have defects in endomembrane traffic required for polar auxin transport. Venation phenotypes are also associated with defects in other signals, including xylogen, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, and small peptides (Casson et al., 2002;Fukuda, 2004;Motose et al., 2004). It is currently unknown whether these diverse factors have direct or indirect roles in vein patterning, but it is remarkable that of the many plant morphological features, venation pattern is especially sensitive to perturbations in basic cellular machinery.\n\nHere, we report the characterization and cloning of the parallel1 (parl1) mutant.\n\nThe corresponding gene encodes a multifunctional protein that is homologous to the S. cerevisiae nucleolin NSR1. Arabidopsis PARL1 complements the yeast nsr1 mutant and accumulates in a subnuclear domain that appears to be the nucleolus. The parl1 nucleolin deficiency causes morphological and developmental defects, including alterations in foliar organ shape and vein pattern, misexpression of developmental markers, and reduced apical dominance and fertility. In embryos, PARL1 is expressed ubiquitously; in seedlings in areas of high cell division and proliferation, and later only in vascular cells of all organs. Since most parl1 effects appear to be auxin-related, we suggest that auxin-dependent organ growth and patterning is particularly sensitive to nucleolin-deficiency possibly because auxin regulation depends on protein turnover and ribosome biogenesis in areas of growth.\n\nA single recessive allele of the parl1 mutant was identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen for vein patterning defects in the first pair of juvenile leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (Clay and Nelson, 2005). The parl1 leaf phenotype was characterized by veins that were aligned with the proximal/distal axis of narrow, pointed parl1 leaves, a reduction in higher order tertiary and quaternary veins, and secondary veins that anastomose in the petiole and occasionally end freely at the leaf margins (Compare Figures 1A and 1B). The vein patterns in the parl1 mutants resembled the normal, parallel vein pattern found in monocot species, such as rice. While adaxial/abaxial arrangement of xylem and phloem appeared unperturbed, vein order was discernible by vein position only and not by vein size, as revealed in transverse sections of parl leaves (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition, the palisade mesophyll layer of the leaf was reduced in the parl1 mutant (Figure 1C). Venation pattern was also affected in other organs of parl1 plants, including cotyledons (Compare Figures 1E and 1F), adult leaves, sepals, and petals. Seedlings with the parl1 mutation had narrower and slightly smaller cotyledons and leaves, delayed leaf initiation, and reduced root length (1.6±0.5 mm; 5.5±0.8 mm in wild-type) (Figures 1G and 1H). Additionally, plant stature (19.3±4.4 cm; 31.1±2.9 cm in wild-type), rosette size (3.7±0.5 cm; 5.6±0.6 cm in wild-type), apical dominance (3.8±0.9 lateral branches; 2.2±0.5 in wild-type), and fertility were reduced in mature parl1 mutants compared to wild-type plants (Figure 1I). These defects suggest Arabidopsis PARL1 is involved in plant growth and patterning.\n\nTo identify the gene affected by the parl1 mutation, a map-based cloning approach was carried out. Genetic analysis of F2 progeny indicated parl1 segregated as a single recessive locus. Linkage to the bottom of chromosome one was initially established by recombination frequency of mapping lines at Simple Sequence Length Polymorphic marker (SSLP) nga111. Further mapping by chromosome walking localized the parl1 mutation to a region flanked by SSLP markers located on BACs F27K7 and F27J15 that contained 12 genes. DNA probes designed to be specific to this region were used to screen a Transformation Artificially Competent (TAC) library (Liu et al., 1995). Two TACs, K1A14 and K13I9, completely complemented all defects of the parl1 mutation when transformed, while the other TACs in this region did not (Figure 2A). This delimited the number of genes in the region to five, which were subsequently sequenced. In the parl1 mutant the only sequence change found in any of these genes was the insertion of two adenine bases into a canonical splice acceptor site at the end of exon six of the At1g48920 gene (Figure 2B). This mutation disrupted the splice acceptor site, resulting in two RNA species containing part or all of the sixth intron in parl1-1 as detected by RT-PCR (data not shown) and by an increased size of the PARL1 transcript in parl1-1 versus that of the wild-type by RNA blot analysis (Figure 2C). Both RNA species encode an immediate stop codon four amino acids later, resulting in a predicted truncated 196 amino acid protein. This insertional mutation was designated parl1-1. A second T-DNA allele was obtained, designated parl1-2, and the T-DNA insertion in exon 9 was confirmed by PCR genotyping. The parl1-2 allele was a complete null at the transcript level by RNA blot analysis (Figure 2C). Since both alleles have identical phenotypic defects, they are likely to be null mutations. To verify that the mutation in gene At1g48920 was responsible for the parl1-1 phenotypic defects, a construct containing the full-length cDNA of this gene was transformed into parl1-1. This construct completely complemented all phenotypic defects of the mutant, including all vein patterning defects of parl1-1 (Figure 2D). We conclude PARL1 encodes At1g48920, which has high sequence homology to a nucleolin protein family member.\n\nWhile NCBI Protein BLAST searches using the PARL1 protein indicated PARL1 was most similar to a plant protein that we named PARL1 LIKE (PARLL1), similarity was also found to a protein annotated as nucleolin from a variety of organisms including humans, mice, chicken, worms, and yeast with 38%, 31%, 34%, 36%, and 34% overall protein identity, respectively. The PARL1 protein contains a putative bi-partite nuclear localization signal (amino acids 21-24, 38-41) and three major regions involved in ribosomal biogenesis. An acidic/serinerich region (45% serine, 34% aspartic or glutamaic acid in yeast NSR1 and 24% and 32% in PARL1) resides in the amino-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 60-263), followed by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs, amino acids 298-370 and 402-477, respectively) and a carboxyl-terminal glycine-and arginine-rich (GAR) domain (62% arginine or glycine in NSR1 and 69% in PARL1, amino acids 481-549) (Figure 2B). The acidic/serine-rich region induces nucleolar chromatin decondensation through interaction with histone H1 (Jordon, 1987;Erard et al., 1988) and binds nontranscribed spacer regions in DNA that separate rRNA gene repeats to organize rDNA chromatin for transcription by RNA polymerase I (Olson and Thompson, 1983;Bouche et al., 1984;Egyhazi et al., 1988;Ghisolfi-Nieto et al., 1996). The RRM (also called RBD) domain consists of ~80 amino acid residues containing two highly conserved regions, called RNP motifs, that interact specifically with RNA, particularly with the external transcribed spacer region of primary rRNA transcripts (Ghisolfi et al., 1992;Burd et al., 1994;Johansson et al., 2004). A phylogenetic tree of the plant and yeast proteins was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and then analyzed using 1000 replicates of bootstrap analysis. The most closely related protein to PARL1 supported in this tree was the paralogous PARLL1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana corresponding to At3g18610. Orthologous proteins to PARL1 protein were also found in Oryza sativa (2 proteins), P. sativum, M. sativa, and Nicotiana tabacum (Figure 3). All of these proteins were homologous to nucleolin from yeast (NSR1 in S. cerevisiae and GAR2 in S.pombe in Figure 3). We conclude Arabidopsis PARL1 is a nucleolin family member homologous to the yeast NSR1 protein.\n\nGiven the homology between PARL1 and the well-characterized NSR1 nucleolin protein of yeast, we tested whether the Arabidopsis PARL1 protein could functionally rescue growth defects characteristic of null nsr1 yeast mutants. With this aim, a characterized yeast nsr1 knockout line was obtained, sporulated, and dissected for tetrad analysis. As expected, haploid spores of the nsr1 heterozygotes segregated in a one to one ratio of slow growing nsr1 knockout to NSR1 wild-type haploid spore colonies (Figure 4A). Homozygous nsr1 knockout haploids were transformed with either a galactose-inducible protein expression vector harboring the Arabidopsis PARL1 cDNA or the vector alone.\n\nTransformants were grown on galactose inducing media lacking uracil and as expected nsr1 containing the vector alone, but not untransformed nsr1, grew slowly on this media (Figure 4B, compare plate regions 4 and 5 with 1). Wild-type yeast transformed with the vector alone grew well on this media (Figure 4B, plate regions 6 and 7), as did nsr1 mutants transformed with the inducible Arabidopsis PARL1 construct (Figure 4B, plate regions 2, 3, and 8). This demonstrates that the Arabidopsis nucleolin rescues growth defects of the yeast mutant nsr1.\n\nGalactose induction liquid growth assays confirmed our results. We found nsr1 to have a doubling time of three hours, which was 1.5 times slower than wild-type yeast, in agreement with previously reported doubling times (Kondo and Inouye, 1992). When nsr1 mutant yeast containing the inducible Arabidopsis PARL1 construct were monitored for growth in the inducing media, the doubling time was found to be the same as wild-type yeast. The rescue of yeast nsr1 mutants by PARL1 suggests a functional role for the Arabidopsis nucleolin in the process responsible for the growth defects characteristic of nsr1 mutants, which has been attributed to defects in 35S pre-rRNA processing.\n\nUnprocessed 35S pre-rRNA is increased in Arabidopsis parl1 mutant seedlings Inhibition of endonucleolytic cleavage in the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS) at site A 0 has been found in nsr1 mutants of yeast. This step is one of the earliest processing events of the pre-rRNA (Kondo and Inouye, 1992;Lee et al., 1992) and this cleavage is conserved in all eukaryotes (Venema and Tollervey, 1999;Fromont-Racine et al., 2003). In Arabidopsis, site A 0 is located +1275 in the 35S pre-rRNA and it is the primary cleavage site (Sáez-Vasquez et al., 2004;Shi et al., 2005;Figure  4C). To investigate whether Arabidopsis parl1 mutant plants had defects in pre-rRNA processing at site A 0 we isolated total RNA from Columbia and parl1-2 seedlings and performed RT-PCR with U1 and U2 primers to detect unspliced 35S pre-rRNA at site A 0 . The amount of unprocessed 35S pre-rRNA was much higher in the parl1-2 mutant seedlings than in Columbia wild-type seedlings (Figure 4D). These results show that PARL1 of Arabidopsis, like its yeast homolog NSR1, participates in 35S pre-rRNA processing.\n\nTo investigate the expression pattern of nucleolin in A. thaliana, a PARL1 promoter GUS fusion construct, P PARL1 :GUS, was characterized in order to evaluate the PARL1 expression pattern. PARL1 was expressed early in development in the finiculus of the seed and ubiquitously throughout the globular stage embryo (Figure 5A). Strong, ubiquitous GUS expression was also observed later in both the globular and heart stages of embryonic development (Figures 5B and 5C) coincident with in situ hybridization results (data not shown).\n\nExpression of the P PARL1 :GUS construct was enriched in vascular cells throughout the seedling, and was vascular specific in cotyledons (Figures 5D-5F). In young leaf primordia P PARL1 :GUS expression was initially strong and ubiquitous (Figures 5D and 5F), whereas later expression was restricted to the leaf tip and developing vascular cells (Figures 5G and 5H). Further analysis of the P PARL1 :GUS construct in other tissues revealed expression of the PARL1 gene in regions associated with cell division (root and leaf tips) as well as in vascular cells of roots and flowers (Figures 5D, 5F, 5I). Taken together the expression analyses demonstrate the PARL1 gene is expressed early and ubiquitously in embryonic development, in regions associated with cell division, and in vascular cells of all organs late in development.\n\nWhile nucleolin is thought to be the most abundant protein in the nucleolus and contains a bi-partite NLS, multiple protein domains are needed for its nucleolar localization and accumulation (Schmidt-Zachmann and Nigg, 1993;Yan and Mélèse, 1993). To reveal the subcellular localization of the PARL1 protein in wildtype plants, an amino terminal GFP fusion to the PARL1 protein, P 35S :GFP:PARL1, was constructed in the pEGAD vector. The fluorescent protein product of the pEGAD vector alone localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of A. thaliana root cells (Cutler et al., 2000). The nuclei of cotyledon and leaf primordia cells expressing the P 35S :GFP:PARL1 construct were clearly seen by DIC optics (Figures 5J and 5M) and DAPI staining (Figures 5L and 5O), respectively. When the P 35S :GFP:PARL1 construct was viewed in the same cells under UV illumination, nuclear fluorescence was observed in cotyledon (Figure 5K) and leaf (Figure 5N) cells. This nuclear fluorescence was most strongly localized to a subnuclear region, presumably the nucleolus (Figures 5K and 5N), and was clearly observed by confocal microscopy (Figures 5P and 5Q). These results are consistent with the localization of nucleolin reported in other systems (Bugler et al., 1982;Shaw and Jordan, 1995) and with a role for Arabidopsis nucleolin in ribosomal processing and biogenesis.\n\nSince Arabidopsis parl1 mutants have defects in vein patterning and PARL1 is expressed in vascular cells (this manuscript, Figures 1 and 5), we wanted to assess how early parl1 acts in leaf vein differentiation. With this aim, parl1 was crossed to the Athb8:GUS reporter line to generate a homozygous parl1/Athb8:GUS line and the reporter was observed in comparable stages to the wild-type/Athb8:GUS (due to the delayed leaf initiation and slow growth of parl1).\n\nAthb8:GUS is a reporter line that marks cells in the provascular stage of development before lignification is observed and is one of the earliest characterized reporters for vein development (Baima et al., 1995;Kang and Dengler, 2002;Scarpella et al., 2004Scarpella et al., , 2006)). In wild-type plants, expression of this reporter was initially visible in both wild-type and the parl1/Athb8:GUS line leaf primordia as a single file of expression that extended from the petiole to the tip of leaf blade, marking cells that later differentiate into the midvein (Figure 6A, inset). Next, as previously reported, two pairs of expression traces connecting to the central line in high-arching loops were observed in the Athb8:GUS line that mark cells destined to become secondary vein loops (Figure 6A). While parl1 mutants resembled the wild-type for early midvein expression, in subsequent stages multiple traces of Athb8:GUS expression extended from the petiole into the leaf primordia, and often ended freely (Figure 6B). This expression pattern change continued with subsequent vein initiation in parl1 (Figure 6D). In wild-type plants, the expression of Athb8:GUS marked the closed, interconnected vein pattern observed in normal leaves at later stages of development and expansion (Figure 6C). However, parl1 at this same stage displayed an Athb8:GUS expression pattern that was unconnected and consisted of freely ending parallel veins (Figure 6D). These alterations in Athb8:GUS expression suggest PARL1 acts early in vein patterning.\n\nThe parl1 defects in leaf vein patterning suggest that responsiveness to the plant hormone auxin may be disrupted in parl1 mutants. To investigate the level and localization of auxin response in developing Arabidopsis parl1 leaves, we monitored GUS activity in a homozygous parl1/DR5:GUS line at comparable stages to the wild-type. The synthetic DR5:GUS reporter construct (Ulmasov et al., 1997) has been used to deduce distributions of auxin response maxima within cells of a given tissue by histochemical reporting from this auxinresponsive promoter (Sabatini et al., 1999). The GUS histochemical activity of this construct appears progressively at sites that anticipate the veins of successive orders (primary, secondary, etc.), coincident with the preprocambial cell pattern that arises during leaf vein formation (Mattsson et al., 2003). In wildtype leaves, DR5:GUS expression was first visible in the tip of emerging leaf primordia, prior to midvein differentiation (Figure 6E). Following this expression, a set of apical loops was observed extending from the initial zone of tip expression toward the base of the leaf. These loops were parallel to the leaf margin and presaged secondary vein formation (Figure 6F). Next, this expression began to turn off in a basipetal fashion, except for expression in the tip.\n\nConcurrently, expression was observed in the middle and basal sites of the leaf that foretell higher order tertiary and quaternary vein formation in these regions (Figure 6G). At later stages, tip expression persisted while apical loop expression ceased and differentiated secondary vein loops were visible. Expression was restricted to the most basal leaf positions, which presaged higher order vein formation in this region (Figure 6H).\n\nIn parl1 mutant leaves, DR5:GUS expression was initially correctly localized in the tip at comparable stages, suggesting the incipient midvein pattern was normal (Figure 6I). This is consistent with the normal pattern of AtHB8:GUS expression at the incipient midvein, as described above, and the normal subsequent differentiation of the midvein. This apparently normal tip expression of DR5 persisted into the next stage, when subsequent veins were initiated.\n\nHowever, parl1 mutants failed to show DR5:GUS expression in apical loops, as is observed in wild-type (Figure 6J) and subsequently failed to differentiate veins in apical loops. At the next stage and subsequent stages, the persistent tip expression typical of DR5:GUS in wild-type leaves was drastically mis-localized in parl1 leaves of comparable stages (Compare Figures 6K-6M with Figures 6G and 6H). In the mutant, expression ceased at the tip, and ectopic DR5:GUS expression appeared in one or two foci offset from the tip. This mis-localization was observed at 9-DAG in 66% (n=502) and at 10-DAG in 86% (n=349) of parl1/DR5:GUS leaves and never (7-DAG, n=178; 8-DAG, n=274) in the wildtype. The lack of apical loop expression and the mis-localization of tip expression in the parl1/DR5:GUS line suggest PARL1 acts prior to the acquisition of preprocambial identity in agreement with our parl1/Athb8:GUS expression results and that auxin responses are disrupted in Arabidopsis parl1 mutants.\n\nAuxin transport and auxin response are coordinated in many plant pattern formation events, including leaf vein patterning (Reinhardt et al., 2003;Scarpella et al., 2006). As auxin response was disrupted in parl1 leaves, we wanted to investigate the role of auxin transport in parl1/DR5:GUS expressing leaves. In wild-type leaves, the inhibition of polar auxin transport (PAT) by naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and similar inhibitors leads to restriction of DR5:GUS expression to the leaf margins, possibly reflecting the accumulation of auxin in these regions (Figures 6N and 6P;Mattsson et al., 2003). Subsequent venation is restricted to the leaf margins. In agreement with this previous report, 1µM NPA treatment of wild-type plants restricted DR5:GUS expression to the leaf margin (Figures 6N and 6P;Mattsson et al., 2003). In contrast, this marginal expression was absent in 1µM NPA treated leaves of the parl1 mutant (Compare Figures 6N and 6P with 6O and 6Q). Thus the expression pattern of DR5:GUS was similar in both NPA-treated and -untreated parl1 leaves.\n\nInhibition of PAT has been shown to disrupt not only vein patterning, but also leaf development simultaneously (Mattsson et al., 1999;Sieburth, 1999). To investigate the effect of auxin transport inhibition on parl1 development and patterning, wild-type and mutant plants were grown on plates containing varying concentrations of the PAT inhibitor NPA. At low concentrations of NPA (0.5µM) the wild-type leaf vein pattern and morphology was radically altered. There was an increase in marginal venation and the number of traces in the petiole. This change was accompanied by a reduction in higher order veins (Compare Figures 7A and 7B). As previously reported (Mattsson et al. 1999;Sieburth, 1999), striking changes in leaf morphology were also observed at low NPA concentrations, as leaves became epinastic, darker in color, reduced in size, and the petiole was shortened (Compare Figures 7E and 7F). This effect was more severe in wild-type plants at higher concentrations of NPA (Figures 7G and 7H).\n\nIn parl1 mutant leaves, leaf shape was converted to a paddle shape appearance at low concentrations of NPA (Compare Figures 7I and 7J). The vein pattern in parl1 leaves was transformed by NPA treatment into a mass of parallel vein traces penetrating the leaf from the petiole (Compare Figures 7M and 7N).\n\nArching secondary veins were found only occasionally at the tip of NPA treated parl1 leaves (Figure 7O). These results suggest NPA treatment of parl1 plants led to the enhancement of parl1 leaf shape and vein pattern defects.\n\nRibosomes are responsible for protein translation in living eukaryotic cells, and their biogenesis is a complex process involving the coordination of rDNA, rRNA, RNA polymerase I, and a plethora of non-/ribosomal proteins. Nucleolin is a nonribosomal multi-functional protein involved in many steps of ribosomal biogenesis. We report here the identification and cloning of a mutation in the PARALLEL1 (PARL1) gene, which encodes nucleolin of Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nThe parl1 mutants display several aberrations in venation pattern of all foliar organs, including the parallel alignment of veins along the proximal/distal leaf axis, the parallel exit of multiple veins from the petiole, and a reduction in higher order venation. These defects in leaves are associated with the mis-localization of activity from the provascular Athb8:GUS and auxin responsive DR5:GUS reporters. We also show Arabidopsis parl1 mutants have an accumulation of unprocessed 35S pre-rRNA that is consistent with our results demonstrating PARL1 is able to rescue mutants in the yeast nucleolin gene NSR1. These data suggest that auxin-dependent growth and patterning processes, including vein patterning, are particularly sensitive to perturbations in ribosomal processing.\n\nFrom these results we suggest that PARL1 is a multifunctional Arabidopsis nucleolin that has a role in ribosomal RNA processing and auxin-dependent growth and patterning.\n\nPARL1 is predominantly localized to the nucleus and in a subnuclear structure presumed to be the nucleolus, consistent with localization of nucleolin in other systems (Bugler et al., 1982;Shaw and Jordan, 1995). We also demonstrated that Arabidopsis PARL1 functionally complements its yeast homologue NSR1.\n\nDefects in yeast NSR1 include a decrease in 35S rRNA and an increase in 35S pre-rRNA that presumably result in a decrease in the ratio of 40S to 60S ribosomal subunits and a slow growth phenotype (Kondo and Inouye, 1992;Lee et al., 1992). Similarly, Arabidopsis parl1 mutants are characterized by a slight slow growth phenotype and by an increase in unprocessed 35S pre-rRNA in seedlings.\n\nWhether a decrease in the ratio of 40S to 60S ribosomal subunits is directly responsible for the slow growth of S. cerevisiae nsr1 and Arabidopsis parl1 mutants remains to be determined, but phenotypic similarities between parl1 and Arabidopsis ribosomal protein mutants suggest this may be the case.\n\nDevelopmental defects including growth retardation, narrow leaves with reductions in the palisade mesophyll layer, reduced fertility, and cotyledon vascular pattern defects are displayed in the ribosomal protein mutants pfl1/rps18, plf2/rps1, aml1/rps5, and stv1/rpl24 (Van Lijsebettens et al., 1994;Ito et al., 2000;Weijers et al., 2001;Nishimura et al., 2005). Since the patterning and growth defects of stv1/rpl24 and parl1 seem to be auxin-mediated, we suggest these processes are highly sensitive to changes in ribosomal processes.\n\nWhile the ribosomal subunit localization of these mutants is unknown, it is likely that the loss-of-function mutations in these genes are localized to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which we predict is also defective in parl1. This may suggest PARL1 and ribosomal proteins affect ribosome biogenesis independently. On the other hand, PARL1 may interact directly with ribosomal proteins. S. cerevisiae NSR1 has been suggested to bind to ribosomal proteins and pre-rRNA to facilitate their interaction (Xue and Mélèse, 1994). As PARL1 can substitute for NSR1 in yeast, this may also be the case for nucleolin in Arabidopsis.\n\nIt is unlikely that the increase in unprocessed 35S pre-rRNA in the parl1 mutant is due to direct RNA cleavage activity of PARL1. Nucleolin has a number of enzymatic activities including autodegradation (Olson et al., 1990;Chen et al., 1991;Fang and Yeh, 1993), DNA and RNA helicase activities (and thus DNA/RNA binding activity) (Tuteja et al., 1995), and DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Tuteja et al., 1997), but not RNA-cleaving activity. The role of PARL1 may be to direct assembly of this pre-rRNA processing complex on pre-rRNA via its RNA binding activity, as it does in vertebrates, rather than to cleave rRNA directly (Ginisty et al., 2000). In yeast the pre-rRNA complex also contains the DEAD BOX RNA HELICASE3 protein (Dbp3p) (Krogan et al., 2004). Double mutants between a verified Salk T-DNA insertion line in the Arabidopsis homolog of Dbp3p, dbp3/RNA helicase5 (rh5), and parl1-2 are indistinguishable from parl1-2 mutants (Figure S1), suggesting these genes act in a genetic pathway involved in ribosomal RNA processing in Arabidopsis, as in yeast (Krogan et al., 2004). If this complex proves to include RNA polymerase I, it would link the role of nucleolin in chromatin remodeling and rDNA transcription with the role of PARL1 in pre-rRNA processing.\n\nInterestingly, the aforementioned Arabidopsis pre-rRNA processing complex dissociated into smaller complexes, which was obviated by isolating the complex from cauliflower, a tissue rich in meristematic cells (Sáez-Vasquez et al., 2004). This suggests a connection between a pre-rRNA processing role for PARL1 and cell division in plants. Supporting this idea, alfalfa nucleolin is absent in stationary cells, but highly expressed before the onset of DNA replication at both the transcriptional and protein levels in logarithmically dividing cells (Bögre et al., 1996). Furthermore, red light treatment induces pea nucleolin transcription one hour prior to rRNA synthesis and coincides with increased cell division rates in pea apical internodes as well as increased nuclear number/weight of pea plumules (Reichler et al., 2001). These data support a link between nucleolin and cell division in plants that may explain the growth defects and reduction in higher order venation characteristic of Arabidopsis parl1.\n\nAlternatively, slow growth and lack of proliferation may be due to other defects in ribosome biogenesis. Pre-ribosomal particles are assembled in specific regions of the nucleolus, moved to the nucleoplasm, and then shuttled through nuclear pores (utilizing ATP) to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs (Milkereit et al., 2001;Cheutin et al., 2002;Lei and Silver, 2002). In light of the fact that this process requires the utilization of ATP, it is interesting that pea nucleolin has demonstrated ATPase activity (Nasirudin et al., 2005). It is unknown if this activity is affected in S. cerevisiae nsr1 and Arabidopsis parl1 mutants or if this could account for their slow growth defects. PARL1 may shuttle ribosomal components to/from the nucleus via an ATPase activity and ability to bind nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of ribosomal proteins. In fact, NSR1 was isolated from yeast based on its capability to bind NLSs (Lee et al., 1991). Whether or not defective shuttling of ribosomal components accounts for growth defects of S. cerevisiae nsr1 and Arabidopsis parl1 mutants is unknown.\n\nWhy does the parl1 nucleolin-deficiency cause a reduced auxin-responsiveness?\n\nBased on current views of the connection between venation pattern and polar auxin transport (Scarpella et al., 2006;Rolland-Lagan and Prusinkiewicz, 2005), the venation pattern defects in parl1 should correspond to a lack of marginal auxin accumulation during leaf growth, and multiple leaf tip sources, causing a predominance of tip to base vein orientation. This is consistent with patterns of auxin abundance/responsiveness that we see in parl1 from DR5:GUS expression patterns and also the additivity observed in analysis of double mutants between cvp2, a mutant with normal auxin responses, and the parl1 mutant (Figure S1).\n\nSince auxin is known to correlate with cell division and proliferation (Davies, 1995), we posit that this lack of marginal auxin sources leads to a lateral decrease in cell division and proliferation that reduces lateral expansion and results in the narrow shape of parl1 leaves. Consequently, fewer DR5:GUS expression sites presaging tertiary and quaternary veins occur, accounting for losses in higher order venation. The pattern of DR5:GUS expression in our NPA studies further supports this idea, as DR5:GUS expression was only observed in the tips of parl1 leaves and not in the margins. A mass of parallel veins in parl1 NPA treated leaves extends toward these tip auxin sources. Notably, vascular pattern and leaf blade shape defects found in tornado1, tornado2, asymmetric leaf1, and asymmetric leaf2 have also been attributed to the control of cell division and blade expansion by marginal auxin sources in addition to changes in DR5:GUS expression at the leaf tip (Zgurski et al., 2005;Cnops et al., 2006).\n\nHow might PARL1, a nucleolin, effect these changes in auxin sources at the molecular level? One option may be that Arabidopsis nucleolin directs the synthesis and or localization of auxin-responsive transcription factors, such as Aux/IAA or ARF genes. It could accomplish this via a number of avenues. If\n\nArabidopsis nucleolin binds to nuclear localization signals (NLS) as the protein does in yeast and other systems, it may act as a negative regulator by binding to NLSs of auxin-induced transcription factors thereby preventing these proteins from binding to their interactors. In this way, nucleolin could work like Aux/IAA proteins through binding to ARFs and therefore inhibiting their ability to bind and transcriptionally activate auxin-responsive targets. Alternatively, since PARL1 affects ribosomal processing in our study, PARL1 may decrease protein synthesis of auxin-induced genes, such as ARFs, in specific regions of the leaf that then cause changes in DR5:GUS expression and/or cell division/proliferation disruptions. Interestingly, the ribosomal protein STV1 required for translation reinitiation, has recently been shown to do exactly this. Mutants in STV1 not only have ribosome deficient growth phenotypes, but also gynoecia and cotyledon vein patterning defects resulting from STV1's influence on ETTIN/ARF3 translation (Nishimura et al., 2005). The molecular basis for the auxin-dependent growth and patterning phenotypes of parl1 as well as their similarity to the phenotypes exhibited by ribosomal protein mutants provides an exciting challenge for further research.\n\nSince the completion of this work, two relevant papers have appeared: Kojima et al., 2007 andPontvianne et al., 2007. These studies support our findings on the roles of nucleolins in Arabidopsis growth and development. They also show sugar-induced expression of nucleolin and ribosomal proteins and a role for nucleolin in the organization of the nucleolus and rDNA chromatin structure, respectively.\n\nArabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-O) seeds were grown under continuous white light (300 µE m -2 s -1 ) either on 0.75% agar media consisting of MS basal salts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), Haughn and Somervile (1986) nutrient solution, 0.5 g/L MES, and 10g/L sucrose or on soil (2:1 mix of Fafard Super Fine Germination Mix to vermiculite; Conrad Fafard, Inc., Agawam, MA).\n\nThe auxin transport inhibition experiments used the agar media described above supplemented with NPA. Exposure of imbibed seeds to light is referred to as 0-DAG (days after germination) in this study. Root length measurements taken from the hypocotyl/root junction to the root tip were measured on plants (100 of each genotype) grown for four days vertically on agar media. For phenotypic quantification, 4 week-old plants (30 of each genotype) were measured for plant height from the rosette base to the stem tip, for rosette width across the center in the widest part of the rosette, and for the number of lateral branches the number of lateral branches from the main stem was counted.\n\nThe parl1-1 allele was isolated from a leaf vein pattern screen of Columbia (Col-O) as described by Clay and Nelson (2005). The parl1-2 and dbp3/rh5 insertion alleles were identified from the Salk Insertion Sequence Database (Alonso et al., 2003). The parl1-2 allele corresponds to Salk 002764, and genotyping was carried out using LBB1 and the following gene specific primers: PARSF: 5'-TGG CCT ACC ATG GAA TTC A-3', and PARSR: 5'-AGT TGC TGT CAC CAA GAA G-3' (LBB1 + PARSF gives the parl1-2 insertion-specific product).\n\nThe dbp3/rh5 allele corresponds to Salk 062509 and was verified to be 29bp downstream (still in exon 7) of the TAIR annotation by genotyping using LBB1 and the following gene specific primers: DBP3F: 5'-TCG AGA CGT TCA GCT TCC-3', and DBP3R: 5'-TGT GTG TAT GGT GGA AGC T-3' (LBB1 + DBP3R gives the dbp3/rh5 insertion-specific product). The cvp2-jp allele was isolated in a leaf vein pattern screen of activation tagging lines generated by D. Weigel (Weigel et al., 2000) and is a recessive mutation resulting from insertion of the T-DNA into the 1988 bp of the CVP2 gene.\n\nOrgans were fixed in 3:1 ethanol to acetic acid, dehydrated in an ethanol series, cleared in Histoclear (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), mounted in 2:1 Permount (Fisher Scientific) to xylene, and viewed under dark-field optics. For GUS analysis, tissues were stained at the same hour daily and incubated overnight at 37°C in GUS buffer described by Donnelly et al. (1999), except 5mM instead of 3mM K 3 F 3 (CN) 6 was used. For parl1 mutants, samples at 'comparable stages' refers to the two day delay in leaf initiation of parl1 compared to wild-type plants. Tissues were fixed in acetone, transferred into ethanol overnight, and mounted as described above. Histological analysis was performed using plastic and paraffin sectioning. For this specimens were fixed, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, and stained as described by Clay and Nelson (2005). For DAPI staining, whole seedlings were stained for 5 minutes by submersion in 1µg/mL DAPI, washed twice in water in an eppendorf tube, and then mounted in 75% glycerol. All specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Oberkochen, Germany), except for confocal microscopy, which was performed on a Bio-RAD 1024 Laser Confocal Unit mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 10 inverted microscope.\n\nPlants homozygous for the parl1-1 mutation were out-crossed to wild-type Ler plants to generate an F2 recombinant inbred mapping lines. DNA from 20 mutant plants was used with simple sequence length polymorphic markers (Bell and Ecker, 1993;Ponce et al., 1998) to establish chromosomal linkage of the parl1-1 mutation, and DNA from 823 plants was used with Cereon's insertion/deletion and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers (Jander et al., 2002)  Total RNA isolation and RNA gel blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from 2-week old seedlings with TRIzol (Gibco BRL, Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a ZetaProbe GT blotting membrane, UV cross-linked and baked for 1.5 hours at 80°C. Blots were stained with 0.02% methylene-blue for 3 min., de-stained for 10-15 min. in 20% ethanol, and the stained rRNA bands were visualized with a Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad). The PARL1 cDNA was labeled with 32 P and hybridized overnight at 42°C to the RNA blot. The blot was washed at 55°C in 0.5XSSC/0.5%SDS for 10 min., then in 0.2XSSC/0.25%SDS, and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-OMAT AR film (Rochester, NY) overnight at -70°C.\n\nTwo micrograms of total RNA from 2-week old seedlings was reverse-transcribed with 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting cDNA:RNA hybrids were treated with 10 units of DNaseI (Roche) at 37°C for 30 min., purified on a Quiaquick PCR column (Quiagen), and used as a template to amplify pre-35S (35 cycles) and UBC (35 cycles). PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 15 sec., 52°C for 15 sec., and 72°C for 30 sec. PCR products (882 bp for pre-35S and 366 bp for UBC) were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with Gel Doc 2000. Primer sequences for pre-35S, designated U1 and U2, were as reported by Shi et al. (2005). UBC primer sequences were as follows: UBCF: 5'-TCA AGA GGT TGC AGC AAG A-3' and UBCR: 5'-CTT TGC TCA ACA ACA TCA CG-3'.\n\nAmino acid sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalX program.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses were performed with PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, version 4.0). The Tetrahymena thermophila sequence was used as an outgroup because of its similarity to PARL1 and the roughly equivalent distance between ciliates and both yeast and plant sequences. Slime mold sequences were also used as outgroups with identical results. All heuristic and neighbor-joining searches were performed by TBR (tree bisection reconnection) branch swapping with option MULPARS in effect and generated similar trees. All tree searches were subjected to bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications.\n\nThe nsr1 mutant (BY4743) was obtained as a heterozygous diploid knockout (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). The PARL1 cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the XbaI/HindIII sites of the pEGH yeast expression vector containing the GAL1 inducible promoter and the URA3 gene (Mitchell et al., 1993). BY4743 (MATa/MATα met15∆0/lys2∆0 his3∆1 leu2∆0 ura3∆0 nsr1::KAN) was sporulated, tetrads were dissected and selected for homozygous nsr1 mutants. The nsr1 mutant haploids were transformed with pEGH alone or pEGH containing the fulllength Arabidopsis PARL1 cDNA. All transformed yeast were grown at 30°C on either inducing media (5.7g/L yeast nitrogen base (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Sparks, MD), 0.77g/L CSM-URA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 10mM potassium phosphate, 0.1% (w/v) dextrose, and 2% (w/v) Gal) or non-inducing media (5.7g/L yeast nitrogen base (Becton, Dickinson, and Company), 0.77g/L CSM-URA (Clontech), 10mM potassium phosphate and 2% (w/v) dextrose).\n\nFor liquid growth complementation experiments, 3 samples each of both ∆nsr1 mutant haploid strains containing either pEGH alone or pEGH containing the fulllength Arabidopsis PARL1 cDNA, as well as 3 samples of the wild-type haploid strain transformed with pEGH alone were transferred from non-inducing plates and grown in 5mL non-inducing media overnight. As described by Reichler et al. (2001), equal amounts of each culture were then transferred to another 5mL of non-inducing media and grown to early log phase. Equal amounts of these cultures were then transferred to inducing media and grown to saturation while (D) Unprocessed 35S rRNA at site A 0 is increased in Arabidopsis parl1-2 mutant seedlings. Reverse transcription of RNA from two-week old wild-type (Lanes 1, 2, 5, 6) and parl1-2 (Lanes 3, 7) Arabidopsis seedlings using primers as directed as in Figure 4C (Lanes 1-3) and ubiquitin control primers (Lanes 5-7).\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded from Copyright © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.
