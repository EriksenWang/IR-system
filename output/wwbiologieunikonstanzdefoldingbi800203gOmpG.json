    "abstract": "OmpG is an intermediate size, monomeric, outer membrane protein from Escherichia coli, with n β ) 14 β-strands. It has a large pore that is amenable to modification by protein engineering. The stoichiometry (N b ) 20) and selectivity (K r ) 0.7-1.2) of lipid-protein interaction with OmpG incorporated in dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes was determined with various 14-position spinlabeled lipids by using EPR spectroscopy. The limited selectivity for different lipid species is consistent with the disposition of charged residues in the protein. The conformation and orientation (β-strand tilt and β-barrel order parameters) of OmpG in disaturated phosphatidylcholines of odd and even chain lengths from C(12:0) to C(17:0) was determined from polarized infrared spectroscopy of the amide I and amide II bands. A discontinuity in the protein orientation (deduced from the β-barrel order parameters) is observed at the point of hydrophobic matching of the protein with lipid chain length. Compared with smaller (OmpA; n β ) 8) and larger (FhuA; n β ) 22) monomeric E. coli outer membrane proteins, the stoichiometry of motionally restricted lipids increases linearly with the number of β-strands, the tilt (β ∼ 44°) of the β-strands is comparable for the three proteins, and the order parameter of the β-barrel increases regularly with n β . These systematic features of the integration of monomeric β-barrel proteins in lipid membranes could be useful for characterizing outer membrane proteins of unknown structure.",
    "full_text": "OmpG is a 14-stranded, all nearest neighbor, β-barrel protein that is normally expressed only at trace levels in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (1,2). The protein is monomeric (3) and, unlike the other monomeric outer membrane proteins such as FhuA that have large pores, the lumen of the barrel is not occupied by an additional cork domain, nor does it have the eyelet constriction of the classical trimeric porins, such as OmpF. OmpG facilitates the uptake of sugars when the main sugar porins, such as LamB, either are not present or are disabled (4). The nonselective pore for mono-, di-, and trisaccharides is unconstricted and has a limiting diameter of 2 nm (5). Gating induced by changes in pH is thought to involve one of the extracellular loops that connect adjacent β-strands folding over the channel entrance (2). From these points of view, OmpG is an attractive candidate for protein engineering studies on channel function of site-specific mutants and the development of biosensors (6).\n\nIn previous studies of monomeric β-barrel proteins, we have determined the stoichiometry and selectivity of lipid-protein interactions with the 8-stranded outer membrane protein OmpA and the 22-stranded ferrichrome-iron receptor FhuA by using spin-label EPR 1 spectroscopy (7), and have studied the orientation and conformation of these proteins in membranes by using polarized infrared spectroscopy (8). These methods provide essential information on the way in which β-barrel proteins integrate in the lipid membrane and how this depends on different lipid species (9)(10)(11). The size of the protein influences both the stoichiometry of lipids associated with the membrane-penetrant surface (12) and the extent of tilt of the β-barrel relative to the membrane director (13). It is thus of direct interest to determine the membrane properties of a monomeric β-barrel that is intermediate in size between those that have been studied so far. This is done in the present work by performing similar studies on OmpG, which we have reconstituted in phospholipid bilayers. In this way, we are able to establish correlations between the membrane interactions and protein size that may be used in the future to gain information on outer membrane proteins that are not so well characterized. 1 Abbreviations: EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; 14-PCSL, -PASL, -PGSL, and -PESL, 1-acyl-2-[14-(4,4-dimethyloxazolidinyl-N-oxyl)]stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, -phosphatidic acid, -phosphoglycerol, and -phosphoethanolamine; 14-DGSL, 1-acyl-2-[14-(4,4′-dimethyloxazolidinyl-N-oxyl)]stearoyl-sn-glycerol; 14-SASL, 14-(4,4-dimethyloxazolidinyl-N-oxyl)stearic acid; ATR, attenuated total reflectance; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; IPTG, isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside; Tris, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane; Hepes, N- (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulphonic acid; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; OBG, n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside; SDS-PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate.\n\nMaterials. Spin-labeled stearic acid, 14-SASL, was synthesized according to ref 14. Spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine, 14-PCSL, was synthesized by acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine with 14-SASL, as described in ref 15. Other spin-labeled phospholipids, 14-PGSL, 14-PESL, and 14-PASL, were prepared from 14-PCSL by headgroup exchange mediated by phospholipase D (15). Symmetrical, disaturated phosphatidylcholines, diC(n C :0)PtdCho, with odd and even chain lengths from n C ) 12 to 17 were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).\n\nIsolation of OmpG. For overexpression and isolation of OmpG, the ompG gene was amplified by PCR (60 °C annealing temperature), using 50 ng of E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA as template. To eliminate the signal sequence, the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TAGGGCCATATGGAG-GAAAGGAACGACTGG-3′ and 5′-CTACTCGAGTCAAA-GCTTGAACGAGTAATTTACGCCG-3′ were used, and the PCR product was cloned into the pET29b vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, yielding plasmid pET29OmpGm2 (16). pET29OmpGm2 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) to express OmpG in the form of inclusion bodies. Cells were grown in 2xYT medium to A 600nm = 0.8, and expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 3 h at 37 °C. After harvesting by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in TBS-I buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at pH 8.0). Solutions of 0.5 mg of lysozyme and 4 mg of sodium cholate were added per 1 g of cells at room temperature, and the cells were subsequently disrupted by using a Branson Ultrasonifer W-450 D with macrotip in an ice-water bath for 30 min. The insoluble inclusion bodies of OmpG were obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 8000 rpm, at 4 °C. The inclusion bodies were washed thoroughly with TBS-II (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 M urea at pH 8.0) and TBS-III (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 M urea at pH 8.0) buffer, respectively. The inclusion bodies were then dissolved in TBS-IV (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 8 M urea at pH 8.0). The solubilized protein was loaded onto a Q-sepharose column that was preequilibrated with Tris-IV buffer, and unfolded OmpG was eluted by means of a 0-100 mM NaCl gradient. Refolding of OmpG was achieved by dilution in 4% (wt/vol) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (OBG), to a final urea concentration of 1.5 M, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 h. Refolding was monitored by SDS-PAGE, taking advantage of the difference in apparent molecular masses of refolded (28 kDa) and unfolded (36 kDa) OmpG, when samples were not boiled prior to electrophoresis (3). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (17), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.\n\nReconstitution of OmpG into Membranes. Phospholipid solutions containing 1 mol % of the desired spin-labeled lipid were prepared in CHCl 3 and dried under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The resulting lipid film was desiccated overnight under vacuum and then covered with argon. The dry lipid film was hydrated with 20 mM Tris, 4% OBG, and 1.5% urea at pH 8.0 to obtain detergent-solubilized lipo-somes. Reconstitution was carried out by mixing 1 mg of the above lipid vesicles with protein refolded in OBG to achieve the desired lipid-protein ratio. The sample was mixed well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Detergent removal was achieved by extensive dialysis at 8 °C against 10 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.2 containing 2 mM EDTA and 250 mM NaCl, using 10-kDa cutoff dialysis membranes. Six to eight changes of 2 L of buffer were made every 7-8 h, with the last dialysis step extending overnight.\n\nElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy. ESR spectra were recorded on a 9-GHz Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer with a model ER 041 XK-D microwave bridge. Samples were placed in 50 µL glass capillaries and flame sealed. The capillaries were placed in a standard 4 mm quartz sample tube containing light silicone oil for thermal stability. The temperature of the sample was maintained constant by blowing thermostatted nitrogen gas through a quartz dewar. Spectra were recorded using the following instrumental settings: sweep width, 100 G; resolution, 1024 points; time constant, 20.5 ms; sweep time, 42 s; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; incident power, 5 mW. Spectral subtraction or addition and integration were performed as described in ref 18. Spectral reference libraries for the fluid and motionally restricted components were obtained from 14-PCSL in egg phosphatidylcholine dispersions and in sonicated diC(14:0)PtdCho small unilamellar vesicles, respectively, at various temperatures.\n\nATR Spectroscopy. OmpG was purified and reconstituted as described above. The reconstituted sample was layered on a clean ZnSe ATR crystal. Initially, the sample was dried with dry nitrogen purge and then desiccated overnight with a vacuum pump. The dry lipid film was incubated in a Bruker IFS 25 FTIR spectrometer by purging with dry nitrogen at 1.5 kp/cm 2 pressure. ATR spectra were recorded at a nominal resolution of 2 cm -1 with polarization parallel (0°) and perpendicular (90°) to the plane of the incident beam. All instrumental settings, other than that of the polarizer, were maintained constant when recording the 0°and 90°spectra. The sample was then hydrated with an excess of 10 mM Hepes at pH 7.2 buffer containing 2 mM EDTA and 250 mM NaCl, prepared in D 2 O, and washed (using a pipet) again with the same buffer in order to remove noninserted lipid and protein. Meanwhile, ATR spectra were recorded at both polarizations for every wash. The specially constructed ATR sample holder was hermetically sealed, and temperature was controlled using a recirculating water bath. Spectra were recorded both in the gel phase (∼10°below the lipid chain melting temperature) and in the fluid phase (∼10°above the lipid chain melting temperature) of the membranes. Further details of the ATR spectroscopy are given in ref 19.\n\nTo determine the dichroic ratio, each spectrum was analyzed using the Peak Fitting Module (PFM) of Origin Pro 7 (Microcal Software, Hampton, MA). If necessary, spectra were smoothed with 11-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing to remove the noise from residual water vapor. A local baseline was established, and band fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was carried out from 1500 to 1710 cm -1 and from 1590 to 1690 cm -1 for dry and hydrated samples, respectively. Lorentzian bandshapes were used with the component bands, except for the major 1625 cm -1 component band of the hydrated sample, which was Gaussian. The absorption intensity ratios for parallel and perpendicular polarization were taken as the ATR dichroic ratio (R), using the intensities obtained at 1625-1630 and 1530 cm -1 from the curve-fitting analysis for the amide I and amide II bands, respectively. These component bands had the same positions and widths in the parallel and perpendicular polarizations. The dichroic ratio was essentially unchanged when fitting was performed with a Gaussian band shape for the component at 1630 cm -1 of the dry sample, instead of a Lorentzian band shape. (The resulting Gaussian bandwidths, 26-27 cm -1 , were comparable to those of the hydrated samples.) The dichroic ratio changes with the first two to three washes and then becomes stable, which is taken to correspond to the respective aligned hydrated samples. To calculate molecular orientations from dichroic ratios, intensities of the infrared electric field components were obtained from the thick film approximation: E x 2 /E y 2 ) 0.450 and E z 2 /E y 2 ) 1.550 for a 45°-cut ZnSe ATR crystal.\n\nLipid Spin-Label EPR. Figure 1 shows the EPR spectra of spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine, 14-PCSL, in reconstituted bilayers of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (diC(14:0)PtdCho) that contain OmpG at different lipid/ protein ratios, as indicated. The spectra are recorded at 30 °C, i.e., in the fluid phase of diC(14:0)PtdCho lipid bilayers. Figure 2 shows gel-fluid phase transition curves for diC(14:0)PtdCho bilayers in the presence and absence of OmpG. These confirm that OmpG/diC(14:0)PtdCho membranes are still in the fluid phase at 30 °C, at protein/lipid ratios up to 1:32 mol/mol.\n\nAll the EPR spectra in Figure 1 consist of two components, a sharp and a broad one, that are, respectively, characteristic of lipids in fluid bilayer regions of the membrane and of lipids that are motionally restricted at the intramembrane surface of the protein (see, e.g., refs 20-23). For R-helical proteins these two lipid populations are not static, but exchange with rates ∼10 6 -10 7 s -1 (24-27), which are slow on the time scale of conventional spin-label EPR and less than lipid translational diffusion rates (28,29), but are rapid on the time scale of NMR measurements (9,11,30).\n\nFigure 3 shows how the two-component EPR spectra are analyzed by using spectral subtraction or addition to yield the relative proportions of the two spin-labeled lipid populations. A subtraction end point that yields the spectral   component arising only from the motionally restricted lipids (Figure 3B), reveals that 1f b ) 34% of the total intensity must be removed from the original spectrum (Figure 3A) by using a single fluid component. Correspondingly, the complementary subtraction (Figure 3C) requires subtraction of f b ) 67% of the total intensity by using a motionally restricted single component.\n\nFigure 4 shows the results of analyzing the spectral data in Figure 1 according to the method shown in Figure 3, including also spectral addition (dotted line in Figure 3A) with least-squares minimization. The dependence on lipid/ protein ratio, n t , is plotted according to the standard expression for equilibrium exchange association with the protein of spin-labeled lipids at probe concentrations (31):\n\nwhere N b is the number of lipid association sites at the intramembranous surface of the protein, and K r is the relative association constant of the spin-labeled 14-PCSL lipid, referred to the unlabeled diC(14:0)PtdCho host lipid. The linear regression in Figure 4, according to eq 1, indicates a fixed stoichiometry of N b ) 19.6 ( 1.0 lipid sites per OmpG, and an association constant of spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine relative to diC(14:0)PtdCho of K r ) 1.0. Figure 5 shows the EPR spectra of different spin-labeled lipid species in OmpG/diC(14:0)PtdCho membranes of identical lipid/protein ratio. The similarity of the twocomponent spectra from the different phospholipid species indicates only limited selectivity of the different lipid polar headgroups for interaction with OmpG. For a fixed lipid/ protein ratio, n t , the ratio of relative association constants is given by:\n\nwhere f b PC is the fraction of motionally restricted, spinlabeled phosphatidylcholine, and f b is that of the lipid in question. Values of the selectivity ratio, K r /K r PC , for the different lipids that are obtained from the data of Figure 5 by using eq 2 are given in Table 1. With the exception of diacylglycerol (14-DGSL), which probably has a different vertical location in the membrane (32), all lipids tested have relative association constants that are close to that of phosphatidylcholine (14-PCSL).\n\nPolarized IR Spectra of OmpG in PtdCho. Figure 6 shows the amide region from the polarized ATR spectra of OmpG in aligned membranes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (diC(16:0)PtdCho). In the dry state (Figures 6A and B), both the amide I and amide II bands are visible, whereas in membranes hydrated with D 2 O (Figures 6C and D), the amide II band is shifted to much lower frequencies where it overlaps with bands from the lipid. Band fitting shown in Figure 6 demonstrates the predominant β-sheet content of the protein, with the major band at ca. 1625 cm -1 in the amide I region (ν ⊥ (π,0) mode), and at ca. 1530-1550 cm -1 in the amide II region (ν // (0,π) mode). The minor band at ca. 1670 cm -1 in the amide I region (V // (0,π) mode) from hydrated membranes is characteristic of antiparallel β-sheets FIGURE 5: ESR spectra of spin-labeled phospholipids (14-PXSL) with different polar headgroups and of the corresponding spin labeled diacylglycerol (14-DGSL) and stearic acid (14-SASL) in diC(14:0)PtdCho membranes containing OmpG at a fixed lipid/ protein ratio of 32 mol/mol. T ) 30 °C; total scan width ) 100 G.  Table 2 gives the results of band fitting for the amide I region from OmpG in disaturated phosphatidylcholines of different chain lengths. Fitting data are given for hydrated membranes in the gel and fluid phases, recorded at temperatures 10°below and 10°above the respective chain-melting transitions. The conformational populations are very similar in the fluid and gel phases of a given lipid. The β-sheet population of OmpG in the different phosphatidylcholine host lipids ranges progressively from 68% in C(12:0) to 58% in C(17:0), with a mean value of 63 ( 4%. For comparison, the β-sheet content is 66% to 71% in the different crystal structures of OmpG ((1, 2) PDB: 2iww, 2iwv, 2f1c), and 43% in micelles from NMR ((34) PDB: 2jqy). Presumably, phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes provide a more structuring environment than do dodecylphosphocholine micelles. A similar conclusion was reached recently from circular dichroism studies on the human VDAC protein: β-sheet content decreased on adding nonionic detergent to bilayer-reconstituted hVDAC1 channels (35).\n\nAmide Dichroism of OmpG in PtdCho. Figure 7 shows the dichroic ratios of the amide I band from OmpG in bilayer membranes hydrated in D 2 O, as a function of chain length, n C , of the disaturated PtdCho. Values are given for membranes in the gel phase and for those in the fluid phase, above the lipid chain-melting temperature. The general trend is an increase in amide I dichroic ratio with increasing lipid chain length. A single dichroic ratio is insufficient to define the orientation of a β-sheet membrane protein because this depends both on the tilt, β, of the strands within the sheet and on the inclination, R, of the sheet to the membrane normal (13).\n\nFor a β-barrel of large radius (or a flattened barrel), the dichroism can be approximated by that for a planar sheet. The dichroic ratio of the amide I band is then given by ( 13):\n\nbecause the transition moment is oriented perpendicular to the strand axis. On the other hand, the transition moment for the amide II band is oriented along the strand axis and the dichroic ratio is given by: where angular brackets indicate an ensemble average. Combining dichroic ratios from the amide I and amide II bands therefore allows determination of R and β separately. Applying this to the dichroic ratios, R I and R II , of the dry samples, yields a consistent mean value for the strand tilt of β ) 44.0 ( 0.7°(N ) 11) from measurements in diC(n C :0)PtdCho with chainlengths from n C ) 12 to 17.\n\nUsing the mean value of the strand tilt, β ) 44.0 ( 0.7°, deduced from the dry sample, together with the dichroic ratios for the hydrated samples from Figure 7, yields the values for the order parameter, 〈P 2 (cos R)〉, and mean tilt, R, of the β-sheets that are given in Table 3. The trend is similar to that of the dichroic ratios: the order parameters increase, and the tilt angles decrease, with increasing lipid chain length.\n\nLipid Chain Dichroism in OmpG/PtdCho. The order parameters, 〈P 2 (cos θ ch )〉, of the lipid chains, relative to the substrate normal, are given in Table 4. These values are derived from the dichroic ratios, R CH 2 , of the CH 2 symmetric and antisymmetric stretch bands at 2850 cm -1 and 2919 cm -1 , respectively. The transition moment for CH 2 stretch vibrations is perpendicular to the chain axis, and the order parameter of the latter is related to the dichroic ratio by (see, e.g., 10):    Chain order parameters are defined by 〈P2(cos θch)〉 ) (1/2) (3〈cos 2 θch〉 -1). Chain tilt, θch, in the gel phase is given in parentheses. b Deduced from the dichroism of the CH2 symmetric stretch band at 2850 cm -1 . c Deduced from the dichroism of the CH2 antisymmetric stretch band at 2919 cm -1 .\n\nwhere angular brackets indicate an ensemble average. Consistent values for 〈P 2 (cos θ ch )〉 are obtained from the symmetric and antisymmetric stretch bands. The order parameters in the fluid phase are smaller than those in the gel phase, corresponding to chain fluidization; these values then represent the mean order of the individual chain segments that are undergoing rotational isomerism. In the gel phase, the values obtained for θ ch correspond to the tilt of the long axis of the nearly all-trans chains. For comparison, the static tilt of the chains of disaturated phosphatidylcholines in gel-phase bilayers that is determined from X-ray diffraction lies in the range θ ch ) 30-35° (36). The values of θ ch that are derived for the gel-phase membranes in Table 4 are close to this range and therefore indicate that the reconstituted membranes that contain OmpG are reasonably well aligned.\n\nStoichiometry of Lipid Interaction. It is anticipated that the lipid stoichiometry of OmpG is related to the size, that is, number of strands, of the β-barrel. The number of lipids that can be accommodated at one intramembranous surface of a β-sheet (or a large or flattened β-barrel) with n β strands is (12):\n\nwhere D β ) 0.47 nm is the separation between adjacent strands, and d ch ) 0.48 nm is the width of a lipid chain.\n\nWith the strand tilt β ) 44 ( 0.7°from IR dichroism, a stoichiometry of N b ) 19.1 ( 0.2 is predicted, which is close to the measured stoichiometry of N b ) 20 ( 1 from spinlabel EPR.\n\nSelectiVity of Lipid-protein Interaction. OmpG displays very limited selectivity of interaction between the different lipids tested, with the exception of diacylglycerol (see Table 1). The low polarity and deeper location within the bilayer of this latter lipid (32) is responsible for the apparent anomaly.\n\nThe short turns that connect the transmembrane strands on the periplasmic side of OmpG are almost exclusively acidic: including the N-terminal, there are 9 acidic residues and only two basic residues in the vicinity of the lipid polar headgroups (1). In the periplasmic leaflet, there is therefore no electrostatic basis for a selective interaction with anionic lipids, such as is found with many other transmembrane proteins (9,11,37). On the extracellular side, there are also only 3 basic residues that face outward from the β-barrel and are located in the region of the lipid headgroups (1). On the other hand, there is a high concentration of acidic residues in this region and in the extracellular loops. The electrostatic surfaces that are shown in Figure 8 reflect this preponderance of negatively charged residues and illustrate why OmpG does not display a selectivity for anionic lipids.\n\nβ-Strand Configuration. Measurements from the amide infrared dichroism yield a consistent value of β ) 44.0 ( 0.7°for the tilt of the β-strands in the different phosphatidylcholine lipid hosts. For a β-barrel with n β strands, the tilt is related directly to the shear number, S, of the barrel by (38,39):\n\nwhere h is the rise per residue along the strand (h/D β ) 0.719 ( 0.022). This predicts a value of β ) 42.5 ( 0.9°for OmpG, which has a shear number S ) 18 (1). The theoretical estimate is quite close to the value measured here from infrared dichroism. The values obtained for the strand tilt, β, from the polarized IR measurements can be used to obtain estimates of the sheet twist, θ, and the strand coiling, ε, by using expressions derived for idealized β-barrels (39,40):\n\nwhere θ o ) -3.4°is the twist in a unstrained sheet of long strands. This yields values for the twist of θ ) 10°and for the coiling of ε ) 6°, from the IR dichroism of OmpG in lipid membranes. Previous work has shown that eqs 7 and 8 are capable of predicting the sheet twist and strand coiling with good precision (8,39). Hydrophobic Span and Matching. The crystal structure of the OmpG transmembrane barrel shows that the hydrophobic belt and aromatic girdles comprise an average of 4.7 outward-facing residues in the 14 strands of the β-barrel (1). With a mean strand tilt of 44°from IR dichroism, the transmembrane thickness of this hydrophobic stretch is therefore predicted to be 9.4 × h cos β ) 2.3 nm. The OPM database (41), which determines the energetics of inserting the protein crystal structure in an implicit hydrophobic membrane (42) with experimentally determined boundary function (43), reports hydrophobic thicknesses of 2.30-2.37 ( 0.15 nm for OmpG. The simple geometrical estimate is in good agreement with this value.\n\nUsing recently refined X-ray data for phosphatidylcholine bilayers, the above value for the hydrophobic span of OmpG corresponds to the hydrophobic core of a diC(n C :0)PtdCho membrane with an effective chainlength of n P ) 13.1 (44,45). This corresponds to the point above which the OmpG dichroic ratios (Figure 7) and order parameters (Table 3) increase monotonically with increasing lipid chainlength. It also correlates with the chainlength above which OmpA is unable to insert spontaneously into large unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine (46).\n\nThe increasing orientational order, 〈P 2 (cos R)〉, or decreasing tilt, R, of the β-barrel with increasing chainlength, n C , of the host diC(n C :0)PtdCho lipid has been interpreted previously in terms of hydrophobic matching (8), and additionally of elastic bending fluctuations of the membrane, which modulate the orientation of the protein relative to the ATR substrate (47). Figure 9 shows the chain-length dependence of the OmpG barrel order parameters. They remain approximately constant up to the region of hydrophobic matching around n P ) 13.1. For these shorter chain lengths, the protein may respond to hydrophobic mismatch by tilting slightly, most probably in a dynamic fashion. Beyond this, the solid line represents a nonlinear, leastsquares fit to the measured order parameters with a chainlength dependence that is predicted for elastic bending fluctuations of the lipid membrane (47). This is capable of describing the chain-length dependence reasonably well, without an appreciable degree of additional static or dynamic disorder (see Figure 9).\n\nComparison with Other Outer-Membrane Proteins. It is of considerable interest to compare the present results with those from other monomeric β-barrel membrane proteins (7,8).\n\nOmpG has n β ) 14 β-strands with a shear number S ) 18, which is a size that lies between that of the other monomeric β-barrel proteins, OmpA (n β ) 8; S ) 10) and FhuA (n β ) 22; S ) 24).\n\nFigure 10 shows the dependence of different parameters on the number of strands, n β , in the β-barrel. The number of motionally restricted lipids increases linearly with n β (Figure 10, top), as is predicted by eq 6 if the strand tilt remains approximately constant (cf. Figure 10, middle). The gradient dN b /dn β ) 1.5 ( 0.1 that is obtained by linear regression also is close to that predicted from eq 6: dN b /dn β ∼secβ ≈ 1.4. The strand tilt, β, varies relatively little between the three proteins (Figure 10, middle), less than would be predicted by eq 7. The solid line in Figure 10 (middle) is the prediction of eq 7 for S ) n β + 2 taking h/D β ) 0.741, with a constant offset of +4.5°added. Note that, whereas S ) n β + 2 for both OmpA and FhuA, S ) n β + 4 for OmpG. This might account for part of the discrepancy with eq 7. In addition, as noted previously (8), the strand tilts from IR dichroism tend to be larger than those from the crystal structures with which the value of h/D β in eq 7 is standardized (39). This may result from a slight relaxation of the barrel structure in lipid membranes, relative to the packing of the protein in the crystal.\n\nThe bottom panel of Figure 10 shows the order parameters of the three proteins that are determined at the same temperature in the fluid phase of the lipid with longest chains, diC(17:0)PtdCho. The ordering of the barrel axis increases progressively with size of the barrel, with FhuA being very highly ordered 〈P 2 (cos R)〉 ≈ 0.8. An approximately linear dependence of order parameter on n β is found. (It should be noted, however, that the dependence on lipid chain length  is steeper for OmpG than it is for OmpA and FhuA.) Correspondingly, the effective angle of tilt increases with decreasing size of the β-barrel, from R ≈ 38°for OmpA, via R ≈ 32°for OmpG, to R ≈ 21°for FhuA.\n\nBy and large, the parameters for OmpG lie between those for OmpA and FhuA. This applies also to the twist of the β-sheets and the coiling of the β-strands. The present work with OmpG thus establishes a regularity in the membrane interactions of monomeric β-barrel proteins, which can be used to gain valuable information on other outer membrane proteins of unknown size and/or structure. A possible example is the nonspecific porin FomA, which is the major outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum (48). The structure of FomA is unknown, but has been proposed to be a β-barrel with variously 14 (49) or 16 (50,51) antiparallel β-strands. This protein migrates as a monomer in SDS-PAGE, without denaturation prior to electrophoresis, as do OmpG, OmpA, and FhuA (52). Therefore, measurements of the type presented in Figure 10 could help to decide between the different models for the β-barrel structure.\n\nFraction (fb) of Motionally Restricted Spin-Labeled Lipid and Relative Association Constants, K r, Normalized to That for Phosphatidylcholine (K r PC ), Obtained by Spectral Addition for the EPR Spectra of Different Spin Labels in diC(14:0)PtdCho/OmpG Membranes of Lipid/Protein Ratio 32 mol/mol PC ).
