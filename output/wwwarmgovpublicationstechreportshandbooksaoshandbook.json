The instruments measure aerosol properties that influence the earth's radiative balance. The primary optical measurements are those of the aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients as a function of particle size and radiation wavelength and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements as a function of percent supersaturation. Additional measurements include those of the particle number concentration and scattering hygroscopic growth. Aerosol optical measurements are useful for calculating parameters used in radiative forcing calculations such as the aerosol singlescattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, mass scattering efficiency, and hygroscopic growth. CCN measurements are important in cloud microphysical models to predict droplet formation.\n\nThe system is located at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Oklahoma and has been operational since the beginning of April 1996. From 1997-2010, the Aerosol Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)/Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)/Global Monitoring Division (GMD) had mentorship of the AOS. In March of 2005 a second AOS system was installed as part of the ARM Mobile Facility (AMF). ARM also archives AOS data from the NOAA Barrow Observatory in Barrow, Alaska at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA). Since 2011 the mentorship is a collaborative arrangement between the NOAA/ESRL/GMD group and the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Science (CIRES) at the University of Colorado.\n\nThe current netcdf file description is located at https://engineering.arm.gov/tool/dod/showdod.php?Inst=aos&View=user\n\nTable 1 describes the directly measured variables from the AOS system in the stnaosC1.a1 netcdf file.\n\nTable 1. Measured aerosol properties from the AOS.\n\nA data flag designates the sampling conditions and level of data processing. The flag field is in hexadecimal format. Of particular importance is the third character bit, which designates the aerosol impactor sampling size. The aerosol sampling switches every 30 minutes between sub-10-micron (0000) and submicron (0010) size aerosol. Table 2 lists the flags and their designations.\n\nTable 2. AOS flag fields\n\nThe diagnostic variables in the AOS datastream include those of the instrument temperature, pressure, RH, wind speed, and direction. A description of each parameter is given in Table 3. The ambient variables as well as wind speed and direction are not merged in all of the AOS datastreams.\n\nTable 3. Diagnostic variables in the AOS datastream.\n\nThe calculation of the measurement uncertainty of each nephelometer follows the protocol of Anderson et al. (1999). The measurement uncertainty associated with the TSI 3563 nephelometer was calculated from five known sources and is expressed as a linear combination of the following terms: du total 2 = du noise 2 + du drift 2 + du cal 2 + du trunc 2 + du stp 2 .\n\nHere, dup designates the uncertainty in u associated with the parameter, p. These arise from the following:\n\n• instrument noise in the filtered air scattering coefficient\n\n• instrument drift in the calibration\n\n• uncertainty in the instrument calibration to Rayleigh scattering of dry air and CO 2\n\n• instrument truncation of near forward scattered light\n\n• uncertainty in the instrument pressure and temperature in conversion of the data to STP.\n\nThe associated uncertainties for each parameter for one-minute averages are listed in Table 4 as a function of the scattering coefficient magnitude.\n\nTable 4. Instrument noise, drift, and uncertainty factors.\n\nUncertainty associated with differences in the aerosol inlets and tubing is expected to be insignificant for submicron aerosol. Losses within the nephelometer itself were found to be negligible for submicron particles and are 5%-10% for super micrometer particles (Anderson and Ogren 1998). The variation in particle size with relative humidity (RH) and hence, the particle transmission through a submicron impactor, operating upstream of the nephelometer, will vary with the particle type. For an RH below 50%, we estimate this uncertainty to be less than 5% based on Berner impactor efficiency curves and estimates of the scattering size distribution. In addition to RH, the flow rate affects the 50% aerodynamic cutoff diameter of the impactor. Running the Berner-type impactors at a flow 10% lower than 30 lpm yields a 5% change in cut size. Typically, flows are within 1%-2% of the expected flow rate.\n\nFor low-scattering values, instrument noise is the prevalent source of uncertainty, while for higher scattering coefficients both noise and instrument truncation uncertainties dominate. Uncertainty for low signal values can be greatly reduced by increasing the signal averaging time. For a 10-min averaging time, the uncertainty associated with noise for a bsp of 1 Mm -1 is 0.40 Mm -1 . Truncation corrections for sub-10 um and super-um size particles are significantly higher than those for sub-um size particles. See Anderson andOgren 1998 andHeintzenburg et al. 2006 for discussions on the uncertainty of nephelometer scattering coefficients.\n\nUncertainty in the particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP) has been described by Sheridan et al. (2005) and Virkkula et al. (2010). Corrections have been made for spot size, flow rate, wavelength, interpretation of scattering as absorption, and instrument response to absorption (Bond et al. 2001 andOgren 2010). Uncertainty in the measurements also stems from the variability of each PSAP unit and from instrument noise. Bond et al. found instrumental variability to be 6% of the measured absorption. Instrument noise (i.e. detection limit), determined by measuring particle-free air, is 0.1 Mm -1 for hourly averaged data and 0.9 Mm -1 for minute-averaged data. The total uncertainty in aerosol absorption coefficient from the PSAP usually varies from 1 to 4 Mm -1 for one-minute average data and depends on the magnitudes of the absorption and scattering coefficients. PSAP noise and uncertainty was found to increase in high RH environments and in air with high concentrations of semi-volatile organics (Lack et al. 2008).\n\nThe data in Figures 1 and 2 show typical aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients at 550 nm for both aerosol size cuts. The data are from November 23-29, 2010 at SGP with one-minute integration times.\n\nThe two colors indicate the two aerosol sizes, which change every 30 minutes. On day 328, November 24, larger supermicron aerosol are present, and the scattering between the two size cuts diverge. Because most of the absorbing aerosol resides in the submicron size range, there is little difference between the submicron and sub-10-micron absorption coefficients on this day. Figures 3 and 4 show the changes in the aerosol size and absorption properties during the same time period.    Figures 3 and 4 display the aerosol scattering albedo and Ångstrom exponents over the same time period as the data in Figures 1 and 2. The data in the figures are 30-minute averages. The relatively large separation in the Ångstrom exponents between the two size cuts suggests a significant fraction of coarsemode aerosol was present. Differences between the aerosol scattering albedo in the two size cuts are small, with the total sub-10-micron aerosol having a slightly higher albedo than the submicron aerosol.\n\nThe aerosol intensive properties are calculated properties from the measured extensive parameters. The intensive parameters calculated from the aerosol absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients are the single scatter albedo, hemispheric backscatter fraction, upscatter fraction, asymmetry parameter, submicron absorption fraction, submicron scattering fraction, aerosol forcing efficiency, and the absorption and scattering Ångstrom exponents. The intensive properties are located in two files: sssaipogrenFn.c1 and ssaaipavg1ogrenFn.c1. The sss prefix designates the site location and Fn the facility at the site. The aip1ogren files are one-minute averaged data, and the aipavg1ogren files are hourly averaged data. An extensive description of the file format, variable description, and calculation process is located on the ARM website at http://science.arm.gov/vaps/aip1ogren.stm.\n\nThe aerosol hygroscopic growth is a measure of the increase in the aerosol scattering coefficient with relative humidity. A description of the humidified measurements and hygroscopic growth calculations is located in Appendix A. As of 2011 the hygroscopic growth VAP was still in its evaluation period and had not been released. Please contact the mentor for information on this VAP.\n\nThe Aerosol Best Estimate (ABE) product gives profiles of the aerosol intensive properties as a function of altitude. AOS and aipogren VAP data contribute to the ABE product. As of 2011 this product was still in its evaluation period.\n\nThis product has yet to be evaluated. More information on it is available in Appendix B, which describes the CCN measurements and data.\n\nAn interactive plotting tool is available on the ARM Data Management Facility website, where users can plot recent or past AOS data from the various sites. The data-plotting tool is available at http://plot.dmf.arm.gov/ncvweb/ncvweb.cgi . The tool plots raw data from the most recent quarter.\n\nRecent and statistical plots of the AOS data are also available on the NOAA/ESRL/GMD website at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aero/net/index.html.\n\nData quality reports (DQRs) and Instrument Mentor Monthly Summaries (IMMS) are available from the ARM database at http://www.db.arm.gov/. The IMMS reports provide a monthly summary of both the data and the instrument operation. The DQRs identify problems with the data. Both report types should be checked prior to using AOS data.\n\nAerosol instrumentation inside the trailer consists of the following:\n\n1. Two nephelometers. These are 3-wavelength (450, 550, and 700 nm) TSI (Model 3563) nephelometers that measure total angular scattering and hemispheric backscattering coefficients from 90° to 170°. The second TSI nephelometer is connected to a humidity scanning system to provide 12 measurements of the scattering coefficients as a function of RH. A check of the nephelometer calibration with CO 2 gas is performed weekly.\n\n2. Light absorption photometer. The Radiance Research (Model PSAP) Particle Soot Absorption Photometer measures the particle absorption coefficient at the wavelength of 550 nm. In April 2005, this instrument was upgraded to a 3-wavelength instrument (470, 528, and 660 nm).\n\n3. Condensation nuclei counter. The TSI (Model 3010) measures the total number concentration of condensation particles of diameter in the size range of 10 nm to 3 μm.\n\nFigure 5 below shows the AOS flow schematic. About 800 lpm flow through an 8\" diameter external stack. The sample air flows through a 2\" diameter stainless steel pipe in the center of this larger flow. 120 lpm flows through the sample tube, which splits into five 30-lpm sample lines. At the AMF one of these sample lines goes into the AOS system, and the other 4 spare sample lines go out through a blower.\n\nAt SGP the spare sample lines go to the HTDMA, ACSM, and PAAS instruments, and one line is used to monitor the temperature and RH at the exit of the sample flow splitter.\n\nThe nephelometer and PSAP instruments are downstream of a set of switched impactors. These impactors toggle the aerosol size cut between 1.0 um and 10 um aerodynamic particle diameters every 30 minutes. The advantage of measuring two aerosol size ranges is that fine and coarse mode aerosols often have different sources, and this method allows optical measurements of both aerosol types. The relative humidities of the four T/RH sensors shown in Figure 5 are regulated via PID (proportional, differential, and integrative) controllers. These PID controllers regulate the relative humidity at the output of the sample splitter and immediately upstream of the impactors to 40% RH. An RH of 40% was chosen to measure the properties of the intrinsic \"dry\" aerosol with minimal contribution from water and also to minimize evaporation of semi-volatile organics and acids from the aerosol. The RH immediately upstream of the reference or dry nephelometer and humidifier is controlled to 40%, and the RH after the wet nephelometer and humidifier is ramped hourly between about 40 to 85% RH. See Appendix A for information about the humidifier operation.\n\nThe instrument flow, pressure, temperature, and relative humidity sensors are calibrated annually. A Bios-brand flow standard is used to calibrate the instrument flows. The SGP facility maintains a Thunder Scientific RH and temperature calibration chamber that is traceable to NIST standards. The SGP and AMF Vaisala T/RH probes are calibrated in this chamber. A magnehelic gauge is used to calibrate the pressure sensors.\n\nDaily Maintenance\n\n• Check flows and vacuum readings\n\n• Check instrument and computer communications\n\n• Change PSAP and CLAP filter as needed\n\n• Fill humidifier and CCN water supplies\n\n• Fill CPC butanol as needed.\n\n• CO 2 span check of nephelometers\n\n• Clean impactors\n\n• Change PSAP reference filter.\n\n• Leak check of system\n\n• Drain and refill butanol in CPC.\n\n• Perform flow calibrations on main sample flow, cpc critical orifice , PSAP, and CCN sheath and sample flows\n\n• Calibrate CCN pressure, impactor delta P, and blower pitot\n\n• Clean CPC • Replace CCN, mass flow meter, and neph hepa filters • Clean CCN opc • Bleach solution purge of CCN column • Clean capillary sample tube in CCN • Replace CCN pump diaphragm • Leak check of CCN • Remove files from CCN hard drive • Clean inlet lines • System leak check • Update software • Clean nephelometers • Calibrate nephelometers • Replace carbon vanes in pump • Replace cracked or dirty tubing • Clean or replace humidifier • Replace nafion tubes before CPC and PSAP and in CCN • Train site technician • Perform inventory of AOS parts and spares.\n\nThe Dasibi (Model 1008) ozone monitor measures the ozone mixing ratio between 1 and 1000 ppbv using monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrophotometry. This instrument was in operation at SGP from 1998-2004.\n\nThe PMS (Model PCASP-X) OPC measures the particle number concentration in 31 size channels from 0.1 to 10 μm. This instrument was inoperable and removed in 2004 because of poor instrument reliability. The data collection for this instrument spanned from 1997-2004. In 2008 a TSI model 3321 Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) was installed as a complement to the HTDMA. The size range of the APS is 0.5 to 20 um.\n\nDaily filter samples of aerosol were collected as SGP from 2000-2008. Patricia Quinn of NOAA PMEL analyzed the daily samples for the aerosol inorganic ion composition. Similar filter samples are collected at the NSA Barrow site that date from 1998 to the present. The sample duration at NSA varies from daily in the spring when aerosol loading is relatively high to one sample per week in the summer and fall when aerosol loading is low. Data from these filter samples are located on the PMEL web site at http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/. The first 2-parameter fit is discussed by Hanel (1976) and the 3-parameter fit by Kotchenruther et al. (1999). Both models assume equilibrium (metastable) growth of the aerosol scattering with RH such that the humidigraph profile does not display a deliquescent growth profile. For aerosol in a humid environment, this behavior will hold true. Most aerosols are a mixture of metastable and deliquescent particles and will exhibit some deliquescent behavior. A quality check of the hygroscopic fit parameter data is the chi-square fit parameter, which indicates how well the data fit the calculated parameters.\n\nAnother check of the appropriate use of such fits is the ambient RH or sample inlet RH. The likelihood of the aerosol displaying a deliquescent growth profile increases as the ambient RH declines. The metastable or deliquescent behavior of the aerosol will vary with composition. The \"a\" and \"b\" parameters in equations ( 1) and (2) will vary with aerosol loss in the humidifier, small differences in the instrument calibrations, and zeros. These parameters are not used typically in the calculation of the aerosol scattering at a specific RH. For calculation of the ambient state scattering, σsp(amb), from the 2-parameter fit, use the following equation.

Below this %RH, the ratio of wet/dry scattering tends to be flat with changes in %RH. The fit quality decreases if data below 40% are included in the fit, as the fit assumes an increasing scattering ratio with RH.\n\nThe initial %RH of the humidigraph scan in the wet nephelometer has a maximum value of 65%. Fit parameters with initial %RH values above 65% in the wet nephelometer are replaced with missing value codes.\n\nFit parameters with fRH (85%/40%) fit parameters above 5.0 are replaced with missing value codes.\n\n• SGP: January 1999-present Operations dates of fRH measurements.
