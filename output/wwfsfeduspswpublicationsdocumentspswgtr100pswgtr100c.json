Martin 2 The growth and well being of hardwoods, as with any other organism, are dependent on the total environment. Many of the factors affecting the hardwoods are considered normal elements in their environment, contributing to their productivity. Other factors are generally considered to be damaging to hardwoods. These agents would usually include diseases, insects, and fire.\n\nThe specific term used tends to indicate the role the agent has. When we use the term disease or pathogen, the indication is that there is damage being done to the plant. Since disease may be any condition of the plant not considered normal and the pathogen as the causative agent, both these terms imply something harmful to the plant. Unfortunately, there is not a general term which might include all the agents which will affect the hardwood, at one level being beneficial, or at least not harmful, but at some other level causing injury to the plant. The pathogens may be, at some level of occurrence, microorganisms, nutrients, weather, or many kinds of macroorganisms. Arthropods include the insects, which are often considered to be injurious to hardwoods. While it is true that some arthropods may be harmful, most contribute to the well-being of hardwoods, even to the extent of controlling damaging arthropods.\n\nFire is another agent often looked upon as being damaging to hardwoods. True, fire may kill or damage hardwoods and may make trees more susceptible to arthropods or pathogens. Fire may also be important in providing the conditions for regeneration and growth of hardwoods. Thus fire, as with other agents, may be either harmful or beneficial, depending on the timing and nature of its occurrence.\n\nThe papers in this section cover the effects of diseases, insects, and fire on hardwoods. Most of these do not cover more than the effects of a single agent, as most of our research is funded and conducted in this manner. We should keep in mind, however, that there is often interaction among the agents which affect hardwood well-being. In the future, hopefully there will be more research which deals with the interaction of two or more agents as they affect hardwoods.\n\nNatural Agent interaction 1Robert E. Martin 2When talking of a hardwood, we generally talk of it in a holistic sense, as though it is an amalgamated mass of protoplasm, all having the same characteristics. Yet we know that the plant has many different organs, may be in various physiological aor [sic] phenological states, and may be at various stages of growth. Thus, talking about the effects of agents on a hardwood, we must be specific about the plant as well as the agent affecting it.\n\nInteraction among agents which affect hardwoods, as well as other plants and animals often influence the total effect of the complex. The total effect can be enhanced in a synergistic way or reduced by the antagonistic interaction among agents.\n\nWe can look at the way in which the interaction proceeds when one agent is considered as the intiating [sic] agent, and consider various paths which might develop from the action. What readily becomes obvious is that we have little information on the progress of the interactions. It is also difficult to sort out the \"normal\" elements of the plant habitat or environment from those which are causing a problem for the plant.\n\nThroughout most of the paper, I'll discuss some potentials for interaction among agents affecting hardwoods. Where feasible, specific agents and interactions will be mentioned. We must realize, however, that many of the situations are hypothetical. The main purpose of this paper is thus to be sure, as we proceed through the meeting that you are considering the possible interactions that might be occurring. Also, you should be considering that we can Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA.

In addition to affecting the vascular plants, the agents interact with each other, either enhancing or mitigating the influence on the overall biotic community. The agents may be biotic, such as insects, diseases, or herbivores, or abiotic, such as various components of the weather, the physical elements of the site, or fire. The purpose of this paper is to look at some of the possible interrelationships among the agents and the sum of their effects on hardwoods. depict here only a small number of the interactions that are possible or plausible.\n\nFirst, let's look at the plant and the many agents which can affect it's well being.\n\nConsidering the plant at the center, since we are centering our attention on it, we can place it at the center and surround it with the various agents (fig. 1). Ordinarily, we might not consider the need to protect the plant from some of these, but any can be injurious or fatal to the plant. Any organism exists in an environment which we tend to consider its normal environs (fig. 2). We seldom know how much of that environment is needed and necessary for the plant's well-being, and how much is deleterious to its health and growth. Many of the agents discussed below are part of that environment we consider to be normal and we don't separate out those effects. In the following paragraphs, we will consider the agents when they seem to have an effect outside the normal environment of the hardwood.\n\nFigure 2--Each plant exists in an environment where elements may be considered normal at some level of occurrence.\n\nInsects are usually considered to be a major souce [sic] of potential injury. Here, I've used the broader Arthropoda, which include the Insects but also the Arachnida (spiders and mites) and the centipedes and millipedes. Although many arthropods are important to the proper growth and well-being of the plant, others may cause considerable damage.\n\nPathogens are ordinarily considered to be the fungi and bacteria which detract form the normal health of the plant. The protection specialist may lump some of the arthropod damage into the disease category, so the separation of arthropod and pathogen damage is sometimes unclear even to the specialist. Indeed, the two groups of agents often work in conjunction, producing a synergistic effect where the sum of the damage is more than the individual effects of either of the two.\n\nFire is an important agent affecting hardwoods. Often it is considered only in the light of damaging or killing hardwoods. We must look at it also in its importance in providing the conditions for regeneration and growth of various species. The variety of fire regimes and their differences in effects on hardwoods must be considered just as we consider the differences among arthropods and pathogens.\n\nWeather has great influences on the health of hardwoods. In contrast to climate, the average of the weather over long periods of time, weather varies considerably from the norm over various periods of time. Temperature, precipitation, and wind in different combinations can have disastrous effects on most species, and can work in consort with the arthropods, pathogens, and fire to make the effects worse. As with the three groups of agents above, proper culture of hardwoods is the best protection from weather elements.\n\nVertebrates have important roles in the distribution and health of hardwoods, as anyone who has cultured a garden or forest is well aware. The role may be from the transport and scarification of seeds to the local annihilation of a particular species.\n\nHumans, though only one of perhaps hundreds of vertebrate species which affect hardwoods, play a key role among the agents affecting hardwoods because of our ability to transport the plant itself, many agents affecting the hardwood, and tools and energy with which to modify the plant and its environment. Biologically we are only a subgroup of the vertebrates, but our special abilities warrant separate consideration.\n\nThe hardwood cannot be considered itself as a homogeneous unit. After considering the wide range of species and habitats, we must consider the various organs, stages, and conditions in which the plants exist (fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3--Agents affecting hardwoods may attack one or more plant organs, stages, or conditions. First, let's consider the various organs of hardwoods. Different agents will have different effects on different organs. Some agents will affect only one organ at a given stage of development under a certain range of conditions. Examples would be various arthropods and pathogens. Other agents, such as fire or weather, might affect the entire plant or many organs at the same time.\n\nThe stage of development of a hardwood is another consideration in looking at the effects of agents. Fire and ungulates might keep seedlings or sprouts of hardwoods at a limited size by repeated killing back to ground level, or might result in the loss of seedlings which have no ability to sprout. Combinations of fire, insects and pathogens might cause the loss of old growth. On the other side, birds, small mammals, and weather may be responsible for the transport and planting of seeds for the establishment of new seedlings at some distance from the source.\n\nThe condition of hardwoods is also important in the effects agents will have. Fire, pathogens, or weather may weaken a hardwood for insects to kill it later, or the phenological state of a plant may make it more or less susceptible to an agent. The site on which the hardwood is growing will affect its general susceptibility to agents; the more ideal the site, generally the less susceptible.\n\nAnother consideration in looking at agents and their effects on hardwoods is the \"normal\" environment in which the plant exists (fig. 3). Each plant grows in a specific location where the factors are unique. The characteristics of that location, as well as the genetic makeup of the plant, will influence what will happen. The rate of growth, form, and susceptibility to agents will all be influenced. Further, we generally can't define accurately the elements of this normal situation.\n\nEach group of agents will be considered in turn. The direct effects of the agent will be considered, as well as the indirect effects as the agent works through other agents to affect the hardwood.\n\nInsects are generally considered to be the most damaging among the arthropods, perhaps because of their abundance but also maybe because their damage is so visible. Injury from arthropods may be direct or indirect (fig. 4). Direct injury from arthropods may be defoliation, such as that of the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica). It is one of several species of worms that feed on oaks, but is perhaps the best known and most studied. Its range extends from San Diego into central Oregon (Wickman 1985). Several papers on this species appear in this symposium. Examples of the interaction among agents are the insect parasites which attack the oakworm (Young 1977).\n\nNew insect pests of plants appear occasionally, introduced from abroad or other localities. Eucalyptus species (Eucalyptus spp.) have enjoyed freedom from many of their natural insect enemies, but the recent appearance of the longhorned Eucalyptus borer may pose a serious threat to some Eucalyptus species, particularly Eucalyptus globulus Acorn 1986). As a newly introduced pest, it may spread more rampantly because it is temporarily from its enemies.\n\nArthropods may also influence other agents affecting hardwoods. The potential for insects to carry diseases has been an important factor in the loss of hardwoods elsewhere, most recently in the loss of so many elms in Eastern United States. Insects may also influence the fire regime, such as the intensity, extent, and return interval of fires. This could occur through changing species composition or overstory cover.\n\nDiseases may affect the hardwoods directly or indirectly through their influence on other agents, and in turn may be affected by other agents (fig. 5). Hect-Poinar et al in this symposium discuss the protection of California oaks from several insects and diseases, and Tidwell (1986) has indexed diseases of California oaks. Diseases may affect the susceptibility to other agents. The interactive cycle with fire, where a tree may be scarred by fire forming an infection court, which in turn may make the tree more susceptible to future fire, insect attack, or wind and snow breakage, might be cited as an important example.\n\nFigure 5--Diseases may act directly to injure hardwoods or in consort with other agents.\n\nFire may be a very important and direct influence on the prevalence of any plant species (fig. 6). It can temporarily remove a species from a site and do much to help another become established -common observations we have all made. Less understood, and often not even considered are fire's role in changing site characteristics and the habitat of arthropods, diseases, and vertebrates in such ways that may greatly favor the establishment and growth of one species of hardwood over another.\n\nFigure 6-Fire may act directly to reduce or increase a hardwood on a site, or may act synergistically with other agents. Martin et al (1976), Mitchell and Martin (1980), and Martin and Mitchell (1980) have considered many of the interactions that might occur among fire, insects, and diseases. Although their papers considered mostly interactions in connection with conifers, in principle the ideas are applicable to hardwoods.\n\nWeather is an agent we all recognize as having a great influence on any plant species, yet one which is not often influenced immediately by other damaging agents. The long-term influence of other agents, particularly humans, may modify the weather and climate.\n\nWeather and climate influence all the other agents and have their direct influence on hardwoods (fig. 7). They influence the species that grow on a site, and, to look back a little further, influence the site itself. As weather changes, the phenological and physiological condition of plants change, making them more or less susceptible to other agents. Drought is often a cause for injury or death of plants. Dieback of the crown or complete loss of plants may occur during and following drought. Drought may also make plants susceptible to insects and diseases. Often it is difficult to determine whether the insects and diseases or the drought are responsible for the decline or death of the plant, or whether it is the combination that is deadly.\n\nWeather which is wetter than normal may also result in injury to hardwoods and other plants. A direct effect may result from the inundation of root systems or flooding which physically disrupts the plant. Wet weather may increase the influence other agents, such as root or leaf diseases which flourish under the wetter conditions. It may be that the Phytophthora fungus attacked the root systems of some shrub and hardwood species during the recent wet winters in California, resulting in plant dieback.\n\nWeather and climate affect the activities of humans, all the way from choices of living sites to daily or hourly activities. The cumulative effects have had and will continue to have a great influence on hardwoods.\n\nVertebrates may affect the well-being of hardwoods in positive or negative ways, often depending on the population of any given species or group of species. Humans, although they technically belong with the other vertebrates, are discussed separately because of their unique nature and capabilities.\n\nVertebrates may affect hardwoods at any stage of development. Perhaps the most obvious are at the seed or sapling stage. Vertebrates may also affect the potential for fires, insects, or diseases to affect hardwoods (fig. 8). Vertebrates may contribute to the distribution, planting, or destruction of seeds. If rodents or birds, in particular, are low in number, the distribution of seeds may be inhibited in those species with relatively heavy seeds. In addition to dispersal, rodents may bury seeds in caches, often leaving unused seeds well-planted for germination. When the population becomes too high, however, most seeds may be used and very few are available to produce seedlings. The swing in population will probably return to the low end in time, thus allowing hardwoods to produce an abundance of seeds which will be available for germination.\n\nLarge vertebrates affect hardwoods by eating seeds, trampling or browsing seedlings, debarking trees of various sizes. Trampling may also provide micro relief and the planting of seeds, or can result in compaction of soils, thus reducing establishment or growth potential. The grazing or browsing may favor the establishment or growth of other plants, in some cases hardwoods, by reducing the competition. Browsing or debarking of trees often provides means for insects to attack hardwoods, which will in turn further weaken or kill the tree.\n\nHumans, because of our unique abilities, can affect not only the hardwoods themselves, but almost all the other agents which may damage hardwoods (fig. 9). Our influence goes even to influencing the weather in the short term if we consider the nature of the rain which falls. The extent to which we influence long-term weather and climate may be more debatable. Since humans are so versatile in the ways they influence hardwoods, from planting and nurturing them on the one hand to cutting and bulldozing them on the other, I'll let the reader ponder the various ways we might influence all the factors.\n\nFigure 9--Humans, through their ability to affect so many factors, may have a wide range of effects on hardwoods.\n\nMany agents influence the well-being of hardwoods at many stages or conditions of growth. An agent at one population level may enhance conditions for hardwood growth, while at another may severely hinder growth or result in hardwood mortality. There is much interaction among agents (fig. 10), and the overall picture would be confusing. Because of all the interactions and the means in which we approach problems, most research on protection of vegetation deals with only a few factors. This approach is both necessary and limiting, and understanding of the entire sphere of influences on hardwoods will continue to be constrained.\n\nFigure 10--The interactions of all agents are so complex that a study of several agents at once would be difficult and expensive, and the study of only one agent at a time may be too simplistic.\n\nEva I. Hecht-Poinar, L. R. Costello and J. R. Parmeter, Jr.\n\nIn the management of oak stands, disease and insect problems are of considerable importance. Some diseases and insects have been known for some time, such as root rot caused by Armillaria mellea (Vahl ex Fr.) Kummer, crown rot caused by Phytophthora spp., pit scales (Asterolecanium minus, Lindinger) tussock moths (Orgyia vetusta (Boisduval)), orange tortrix (Argvrotaenia citrana (Fernald)) and oak troths (Phryqanidia californica, Packard). Other pathogens and pests have only recently been recognized and apparently fluctuate markedly in response to environmental vicissitudes.\n\nThe Index of Diseases and Microorganisms associated with California Oak trees (Tidwell, 1986) lists A. mellea on 10 oak species. This fungus is found frequently on root systems where, under natural conditions, it may cause little damage. However, when oaks are watered near the root crown in the summer or otherwise stressed, they may succumb to this root rot rather rapidly. There is no known effective chemical treatment for a tree with this disease, but if the disease has not progressed too far, cutting out the infected tissue and exposing the affected area to air has been suggested to prolong the life of the tree (Brown et al., 1963).\n\nPhytophthora crown rot is mainly a problem in nurseries or in urban plantings and also is associated with over watering in the summer. Other pathogens of oaks include Spaerotheca lanestris causing powdery mildew and witches' brooming and Erwinia quercina, a bacterium, causing a drippy acorn disease (Brown et al., 1963) just to mention a few.

Since 1977 two diseases in particular have become a problem: a large-branch dieback caused by Diplodia quercina, which is more severe when trees are stressed by drought, and a twigblight caused by Cryptocline cinerescens and Discula quercina which has become severe following some very wet seasons. An association between pit scale infestation and twig blight severity was established, although the nature of this interaction is not clear. Experiments to control the two diseases showed promising results with Banner, Rubigan and especially with pruning and Benomyl. listed 418 spp. of organisms on 37 oak species (native and imported) in California.\n\nThere are 50 insect pests listed on Quercus spp. of which the pit scale often is serious on Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia. Applications of an oil-carbaryl mixture during the period of early crawler emergence (late April through early June) gives effective control of this insect (Koehler et al., 1968).\n\nDuring the last 8 years, dieback (Hecht-Poinar, 1986) and twig blight (Hecht-Poinar, 1981) have become of concern to ranch owners, landscape architects and urbanites in California. This report mainly concerns these diseases.\n\nDieback and twigblight are common and sometimes severe in all of the coast range counties where observations have been made. Tree mortality has been reported in Marin, San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, (Contra Costa, San Mateo, Napa, Solano, and Monterey counties (fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1--Distribution of Dieback and Twigblight on Quercus agrifolia (1982)(1983)(1984).\n\nAreas where systematic surveys were conducted, the disease occurred on a variety of sites, topographies and exposures. Trees varied widely in susceptibility to twig blight. next to trees with severe symptoms (fig. 2).\n\nUnaffected trees frequently were found growing DIEBACK A dieback of large branches (fig. 3) of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. lobata Nee, and Q. kelloqii [sic] Newb. is caused by Diplodia quercina West. This disease appeared after the severe drought of 1976-1977in California (Hecht-Poinar et al., 1981). A similar association was found in Belgium by bland (1945) who reported devastating losses due to Diplodia in red oak forests in the Ardennes following a period of severe drought in the 1940s. During the early eighties, when California experienced several wet winters, this dieback became less severe; it increased again in 1985-1986 following a relatively dry early spring period.\n\nInoculations made with hyphae which had been grown in culture in a laboratory confirmed that infection could occur through wounds, pruning cuts, leaf scars and occasionally petioles. The regular presence of the fungus in buds suggests that petiole infection might occur in nature. However, the failure of the fungus to spread from sporulating infections to nearby healthy branches suggests that direct infections without wounds are not common. The fungus rarely grows from one branch fork to another or down a branch to the main stem. While black staining in the wood may extend for 60 cm from the point of infection, the fungus rarely can be isolated more than a few cm from the point of entry. A large number of inoculations were made on mature Q. agrifolia with different isolates of Diplodia quercina. With each isolate, five branches were used on each of two trees. During the winter months no dieback developed, even though the fungus became established. Following early spring and late summer inoculations, most branches were girdled and killed within 2-4 weeks. Asexual fruiting bodies of the fungus formed above and below the point of inoculation within 1 month and once, in July 1983, within 2 weeks. These structures produced viable spores for about 2 years. Spores germinated within 24 hours in a moist environment. (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished).\n\nExperiments with different concentrations of Benlate (Benomyl-Methyl 1-(butyl carbamoyl)-2 benzimidazolecarbamate) 50% (DuPont) on 64 large oaks in three different locations, showed: 1) the recommended dosage of 1 lb/100 gal Benlate was not as effective against subsequent inoculations with Diplodia as were dosages of 4, 7, and 10 lbs/100 gal.; 2) Benlate could be recovered from the branches up to 15 months after spray application with all concentrations and 3) protection lasted for at least 12 months when the trees were sprayed in May; however 4) when trees which were already infected and showed active fungus were sprayed with the fungicide, no effect on germination of the spores was observed (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished).\n\nThe twigblight (fig. 4) of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. lobata Nee, and Q. wislizenii A. DC., which has become a serious problem since the early eighties, is caused by at least two organisms: Cryptocline cinerescens (Bul.) von Arx (Morgan-Jones, 1973) and Discula quercina (West) von Arx. (von Arx, 1957;Hecht-Poinar, 1986). Pathogenicity was established for both fungi on oak seedlings in the greenhouse (fig. 5).\n\nInoculations of mature trees and stump shoots were unsuccessful on 10 successive attempts between December 1982 and March of 1984. Results of greenhouse researches suggest that these 2 fungi infect in nature during periods when oaks are producing succulent new shoots in early spring during cool weather. In the greenhouse, mature spores are produced in about 2 months, whereas in the field, mature asexual fruiting structures apparently are not produced following current year infections until late fall or winter, a lapse of at least 8 months. Mature fruiting structures produced large numbers of viable spores after only 6 hours of moisture.\n\nIn infected trees, twigblight may vary from just a few twigs to nearly complete involvement of the crown. Sometimes twigblight is more pronounced on one side of the crown or on lower branches, and observations suggest that repeated heavy infection may lead to death of some trees. Buds may harbor the fungus but acorns have not been found to do so.  An explanation for the sudden epidemic of twig blight is wanting. Anthracnose diseases are often unpredictable and similar outbreaks of leaf and twig diseases have been observed at different times on bay trees, madrones, Chinese elms and other tree species in this area. Some anthracnoses, notably those on Modesto ash and California sycamore, commonly occur at high levels, others such as those on bay rarely produce epidemics. However, observations carried out in cooperation with C. S. Koehler (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished) showed that the amount of twig dieback may be correlated with the amount of pit scale (fig. 6). The basis of this relationship has not been determined. It was found that fruiting structures are often produced in a ring around individual scale insects (fig. 7). Crawlers, therefore, might pick up spores as they emerge and disperse, but emergence generally occurs in May, when sporulation is unlikely. A similar interaction between pit scales and Dothiorella (Boyce and Speers, 1959) and Botryodiplodia (Schmidt and Fergus, 1965) on Q. prinus was observed. Attempted isolations from 50 surfacesterilized scale insects failed to yield either twig infecting fungus. Isolations from brown  spots under a similar number of scales on undiseased twigs also failed to yield either fungus.\n\nControl experiments against twig blight have been carried out in the greenhouse and in the field with a number of fungicides which had shown promise against the fungi in culture media in the laboratory. Of the 6 fungicides tested Banner (Ectaconazole), Rubigan (EL-222) and Benlate (Benomyl) so far show the most promise in the control of twigblight although data are incomplete at this time.\n\nPlantations 1Stephen D. Hobbs and Steven R. Radosevich 2   The need to control evergreen hardwoodfoot_8 competition in coniferous plantations on Pacific Coast sites (California, Oregon, and Washington) has been clearly established (Cleary 1978, Newton 1981and 1984, Strothmann and Roy 1984, Tappeiner et al. 1986a, Walstad et al. 1986). In young plantations competition results in reduced conifer growth and in many cases, increased seedling mortality. This effect has been well-documented (Zavitkovski et al. 1969, Gratkowski and Lauterback 1974, Radosevich et al. 1976, and others) and has been shown to cause regeneration delays which can produce substantial losses in both timber value and volume yield (Brodie and Tedder 1982).\n\nFor the last several decades perhaps the single most versatile and cost-effective vegetation management tool available to foresters has been herbicides. Yet the controversy surrounding the use of these chemicals in the forest environment has significantly increased in recent years which has resulted in additional restrictions. Despite the fact that many foresters view these restrictions as transitory, it is very likely that opposition to the use of herbicides in forestry will persist and that increasing regulatory limitations will preclude realization of their full potential as a vegetation management tool (Hobbs 1986).\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a strategy and framework for dealing with evergreen hardwood competition in new conifer plantations without the benefit of herbicides using\n\nGen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Evergreen hardwoods represent a significant source of competition for conifers. This effect can be particularly severe in new plantations where these species cause substantial growth losses and frequently increase seedling mortality. Although herbicides provide a proven, cost-effective method for control of evergreen hardwood competition, increased restrictions on their use have shown that existing alternative vegetation management treatments and strategies need refinement and that new approaches should be developed. Existing nonchemical treatments for controlling evergreen hardwoods are reviewed and a framework for using existing technology presented.\n\nnonchemical treatments based on existing knowledge. Geographically, the paper is limited to those areas with a Mediterranean-like climate, principally southwest Oregon, northern California, and those portions of the Sierra Nevada which support the development of mixed conifer and evergreen hardwood forests. Our discussion is predicated on the assumption that policies conducive to intensive forest management (e.g., artificial regeneration) will be continued through the 1990s. Because the control of competing vegetation is vital to successful reforestation in water limited environments, the focus of this paper will be restricted to vegetation management treatments associated with stand establishment. Although a discussion of nonchemical treatment costs are beyond the scope of this paper, their importance in management decisions should not be overlooked.\n\nEvergreen hardwoods have evolved adaptations which make them particularly well-suited to forest environments characterized by a Mediterranean-like climate (i.e., hot, dry summers and wet, cool winters). Such adaptations afford these species a competitive advantage over conifers until the latter are large enough to limit hardwood growth or cause other concomitant changes in the understory environment which may limit evergreen hardwood regeneration (Tappeiner et al. 1986b). Despite the fact that in many cases conifers eventually become dominant, prolonged competition from well adapted evergreen hardwoods results in lost conifer growth, extended rotations and in some instances, understocked or nonstocked stands. Morphological characteristics such as sclerophyllous leaves with thick cuticles and sunken stomata help to minimize transpirational water loss during summer drought. For some species such as canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis Liebm.), deep root systems are able to tap sources of soil water unavailable to conifer seedlings (Hobbs and Wearstler 1985). Other evergreen hardwood species which lack this ability have extensive lateral root systems capable of quickly extracting water from a large soil volume. Physiologically these plants are also capable of reduced respiration and transpiration during periods of high moisture stress and even though photosynthesis may be reduced, net photosynthesis may still occur up to approximately 15 bars of moisture stress (Hanes 1977). Based on work done by Harrison et al. (1971, cited in McDonald 1982), it is reasonable to suggest that some evergreen hardwood species in southwest Oregon and northern California may be capable of net photosynthesis throughout the year. This has also been suggested as possible for conifers in southwest Oregon (Emmingham and Waring 1973).\n\nReproductive adaptations enable evergreen hardwoods to rapidly reoccupy forest sites following disturbance. For example, many species such as mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus Kell.) can produce thousands of viable seed per hectare. These may remain dormant in the soil duff layer until disturbed by fire after which rapid germination may result when conditions are favorable (Gratkowski 1974). Many evergreen hardwood species are also capable of producing numerous sprouts following either fire or mechanical damage to the above ground portions of the plant. For example, Hobbs and Wearstler .(1985) reported 861,513 sprouts per hectare of canyon live oak and greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Green) during the first year following slashing with chain saws. This adaptation is particularly difficult to control because plants may sprout repeatedly unless meristematic tissues in burls and roots are killed. The ability of evergreen hardwoods to quickly occupy sites following disturbance, whether by seed or sprout, enables them to remain the dominant form of vegetation for many years thus limiting conifer establishment and prolonging the transition to a conifer dominated forest.\n\nWe have not attempted to describe in detail the numerous adaptations this group of plants have evolved, but have mentioned the more obvious characteristics. For a more thorough account of evergreen hardwood adaptations the reader is referred to McDonald (1982).\n\nAmong the reasons seedlings fail to survive or grow following planting is their proximity to associated vegetation. Competition is not the only reason that trees fail to respond as expected following planting, however, but they rarely perform well if subjected to significant levels of it. Competition from associated vegetation can account for very large declines in coniferous tree productivity. Data from various locations in North America suggest that from 2-to 10-fold decreases in forest productivity can be caused from competing vegetation (Stewart et al. 1984). In addition, the presence of hardwood tree species in new plantations can markedly affect the species composition of the stand, and thus, its overall value.\n\nAn important fact about forest vegetation management is that thresholds of competition exist. In other words, there is a level of vegetation control which must be obtained for effective, economical tree responses to occur. These threshold values vary according to the density of trees, proportion of the species involved, and distance to competitors. McDonald (1980) reported an experiment in which a constant density of seedling ponderosa pine (0.1 tree/m 2 = 1,000 trees/ha) was subjected to various hardwood shrub densities (0 to 3.5 shrubs/m 2 ). Canopy cover of the shrubs at the sixteenth year ranged from 0 to 4,100 m 2 /ha. A strong relationship was found between ponderosa pine growth (tree diameter and height) and the degree of shrub density and cover. During the sixteen years of this study, the increase in tree productivity in the shrub-free vs. the heavy shrub stand was 9.5 cm in diameter and 3.2 m in height.\n\nA similar study was conducted by Oliver (1979) on a more productive site. In this study, various spacings of ponderosa pine were subjected to either a constant level of hardwood shrubs (14,000 m 3 /ha canopy) or to no shrubs. After twelve years, the absence of shrubs significantly increased stem diameter, height, and live crown ratio of the ponderosa pine relative to trees growing in shrubs. The effects of shrub association were most pronounced at wide tree spacings. Similar observations have been made in other experiments with other species (e.g., Gratkowski and Lauterback 1974, Radosevich et al. 1976, Allan et al. 1978, Balmer et al. 1978, Nelson et al. 1981, Conard and Radosevich 1982). Generally, trees will not respond to vegetation manipulation in the geographical area addressed by this paper until at least 70 to 80 percent of the competitors have been suppressed. Success of a species will depend on the resource requirements of that species, the availability of resources during periods of demand, and adaptations to partitioning of resources in time and space relative to other species in the community. A generalized relationship between the survival and growth and competition intensity is depicted in figure 1. Lanini and Radosevich (1986) measured the microenvironmental changes and hardwood shrub responses that resulted from three methods of site preparation (rotary chopper, brushrake, or controlled burn) and subsequent shrub suppression by herbicide application. The relative value of vegetative manipulation also was examined by evaluating conifer growth in relation to site resource status. After four years 2,000 m 3 /ha and 7200 m 3 /ha of shrub canopy volume were observed on the brushraked and rotary chopped plots, respectively. The controlled burn was intermediate in response (5000 m 3 /ha). However, herbicide application after any method of site preparation maintained shrub canopy volumes below 1000 m 3 /ha for the four-year study period. Resource availability varied with the level of shrub suppression. Both soil moisture and light were most plentiful when shrub canopy volumes were lowest. However, water abundance was the resource most improved by the absence of shrubs.\n\nPonderosa pine growth responded favorably to increases in both light and soil moisture. These factors interacted significantly to increase growth of ponderosa pine when shrub canopy volumes were low. Increases in soil moisture were more beneficial for sugar pine and white fir height and canopy volume growth than was increased light. However, an increase in white fir stem growth resulting from an increase in soil moisture at low shrub canopy volumes was offset by increased light abundance which had a negative influence. Studies similar to that of Lanini and Radosevich (1986) have been conducted by others (e.g., Zedaker 1981), Preest (1975) and Ross et al. (1986)). In essence, these studies have found a quantitative linkage between the availability of resources, physiological processes, and subsequent morphological development of trees. Gains in growth rate of conifers have generally been greatest when the competing vegetation has been well controlled and when the operations were performed very early in the life of the conifers.\n\nWe suggest that without herbicides, the most critical period for the application of nonchemical treatments is during the plantation establishment phase and that all treatments should focus on promoting rapid, early growth. After site preparation plants will begin to reinhabit the site. The time to manipulate vegetation for greatest success is during this period because the vegetation is usually less prevalent and is often more susceptible to control. Most successful vegetation management occurs within the first five years of a plantation's life. Occasionally competing vegetation becomes so tenacious after planting that some form of suppression must occur to maintain the plantation. It is rare that such treatments ever kill all the competing vegetation. Rather, the goal is to suppress it sufficiently to allow conifers to gain dominance. These treatments must usually occur within a few years of planting in order to be successful.\n\nUnfortunately there is no single nonchemical treatment as effective as an appropriately prescribed herbicide for the control of competing evergreen hardwoods. There are, however, a number of alternatives which may offer potentially useful treatments. Although under certain conditions such treatments may be effective when applied on an individual basis (i.e., a single treatment used during site preparation), a more realistic scenario for many sites is likely to be the utilization of at least two of these treatments during plantation establishment. Regardless of which nonchemical treatments are used, the suggested strategy for the nonchemical management of evergreen hardwood competition should be based on a system of three performance criteria: carefully analyze site conditions; reduce competition quickly and use supplemental treatments if necessary; and strive for operational perfection.\n\nPrior to the controversy about chemical use in the forest, reforestation prescription errors which resulted in rapid site occupancy by evergreen hardwoods, could frequently be remedied with a herbicide application. Currently, such operational flexibility has been severely limited. Although reforestation prescriptions should be based on a thorough evaluation of site conditions likely to exist during the stand establishment phase, such attention to detail is not often the case. Only through a careful on-the-ground inspection of the site prior to harvest can potential vegetation management problems be evaluated. For example, dormant seed buried in the duff layer could not be detected by an arm chair survey, the result of which might be the emergence of thousands of evergreen hardwood germinants following the use of prescribed fire. In the absence of herbicides such an oversight is likely to result in additional treatment expense or the failure to meet minimum stocking standards. Similarly, the sprouting potential of evergreen hardwoods in the understory of mature conifer stands could not be assessed without an on-site inspection. This would indeed be unfor tunate because for some species such as tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. and Arn.) Rehd.) and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh) prediction equations have been developed which are capable of estimating the sprouting response to cutting and fire (Tappeiner et al. 1984). The most crucial aspect of the preharvest site evaluation is to be able to anticipate what environmental conditions are likely to exist at planting as the result of prescribed treatments and how they will affect seedling performance. It is also important to consider how quickly and to what extent these conditions may change due to the encroachment of competing vegetation.\n\nPreviously we suggested that for conifer seedlings the most critical period during which competition from evergreen hardwoods or other types of vegetation should be minimized is during the establishment phase. The exact length of this period will vary among sites depending upon individual circumstances. The concept of a critical period during which weed competition will have a profound effect on crop yield is not new, however. Although this hypothesis is drawn from agricultural studies of annual crops (Zamdahl 1980, cited in Radosevich andHolt 1984) we believe it has applicability to forestry as well. It has been our experience that seedlings grown in environments maintained in a relatively weed-free condition for several years following planting will rapidly increase growth thus dramatically improving the probability of successful establishment. During this period it is the rate of site occupancy by evergreen hardwoods relative to that of planted seedlings that is of primary concern. Treatments which enhance this relationship in favor of conifers should be used judiciously to achieve the desired effect. The long-term objective is to attain rapid crown closure of conifers. We hypothesize that in the absence of herbicides actions taken during the establishment phase will probably affect achieving this objective more than at any other time during the rotation.\n\nHistorically, herbicides have provided the forester with numerous options that add stability and reliability to timber management plans because of their proven effectiveness in temporarily controlling unwanted evergreen hardwoods. However, without this tool or with increased limitations on its use, the forester will lose some of the flexibility to respond effectively to unanticipated vegetation management problems. Under such circumstances the margin for error in reforestation operations will decrease. Mistakes made throughout the reforestation process, from preparing the prescription and growing seedlings in the nursery to post-planting vegetation or animal damage control treatments, are likely to be compounded in terms of seedling performance. Because many nonchemical treatments as currently practices are not as effective as herbicides, increased attention to detail is essential. For example, inadequate planning, sloppy contract administration, and infrequent visits to newly planted areas to assess changes will probably result in decreased stocking. The appropriate utilization of existing technology in a timely manner with an extra helping of common sense and some ingenuity are prominent ingredients for implementing the nonchemical strategy.\n\nWe have identified 12 nonchemical treatments for which some information is available (table 1). The extent of this information varies widely among treatments, however. For example, information on the use of prescribed burning for site preparation is voluminous and yet that related to the effect of preharvest burning on potential post-harvest competitors is confined to relatively few publications. Most of these nonchemical treatments effect seedling performance by reducing the transpirational leaf surface area of evergreen hardwoods thus improving soil water conditions. Other treatments, although not designed to reduce the size or extent of the competitor, are intended to increase seedling survival or growth thus improving the ability to compete. These we refer to as supplemental treatments (i.e., animal damage control, artificial shade, slow release fertilizers, genetically improved planting stock).\n\nPrescribed burning has been used for years to prepare sites for planting and considerable information is available (Loucks et al. 1986). One of the beneficial aspects of this treatment is that it temporarily delays the recovery of sprouting evergreen hardwoods by approximately a year. This has been shown to result in increased soil water (Gaweda 1983). However, such treatments may stimulate the germination of dormant evergreen hardwood seed (Gratkowski 1974) or create conditions favorable for rapid site domination by herbaceous species; particularly grasses. For many sites, post-planting follow-up treatments are likely to be necessary because of sprout emergence or occupancy by herbaceous vegetation. This is particularly true for areas burned after conditions associated with the winter/spring planting season have become unfavorable thus allowing vegetation a complete growing season to recover before the next favorable planting period. This situation should be avoided, particularly on south exposures where moisture demand will be highest.\n\nForesters have much less experience with preharvest underburning but some early results are encouraging (Martin 1982, Kauffman andMartin 1985a andb). Kauffman and Martin (1985b) found that burning while sprouting shrubs were actively growing increased mortality regardless of how much duff was consumed. They also found seed supplies may be dramatically reduced by several preharvest burns and increased duff consumption (Kauffman and Martin 1985a). On soils where duff conservation is a major concern, a single light to moderate burn followed by another type of treatment (e.g., slashing, grubbing, hand-pulling) may be effective although as far as we know this combination has not been tested. Despite the fact that the long-term effects of preharvest burning on competing vegetation are unknown for northern California and southwest Oregon, the treatment may have potential and is in keeping with the suggestion that preharvest treatment of evergreen hardwoods may be an effective method of controlling their recovery following disturbance (Martin 1982, Tappeiner et al. 1986b).\n\nMachine site preparation treatments have been used for many years to control various types of competing vegetation, including evergreen hardwoods. These treatments are, however, usually restricted to slopes of 35 percent or less because of machine limitations. Generally with increasing treatment severity (e.g., soil displacement), the more effective the control of competing vegetation. Concern over the maintenance of longterm site productivity by the retention of surface soil is an important consideration, however, and may preclude the use of some machine treatments on many sites. With less severe treatments such as root-raking without soil displacement or discing, the need for a follow-up post-planting treatment may exist. For more detailed discussions of machine site preparation the reader is referred to Roby and Green (1976), Gutzwiler (1976), Stewart (1978), and Ross and Walstad (1986).\n\nRemoval of young plants that have developed from seed is possible by grubbing with hand tools or may even be pulled by hand. Little information is available on these techniques probably because they have never been seen as realistic options. They are labor intensive and impractical for the control of sprouts developed from previously well-established plants. This type of treatment may have some utility, however, after prescribed fire or machine site preparation treatments which stimulate evergreen hardwood seed germination.\n\nBrush slashing_ has received sporadic attention during the last 30 years but has never been viewed as a serious option for the control of evergreen hardwoods. In addition to being labor intensive, brush slashing stimulates vigorous sprouting in many evergreen hardwood species. Little is known, however, about the effect of different intensities, frequency or timing of slashing treatments relative to the species ecophysiology. What little information is available has been recently summarized by Hobbs (1986). This treatment option may have potential when used in conjunction with either pre-or post-harvest prescribed burning or machine site preparation. It is important to recognize the fact that on some sites, slashing may result in rapid site occupancy by herbaceous vegetation. We have observed this to occur in southwest Oregon, particularly on those sites without appreciable amounts of scree or ravel (a mantle of unstable rock fragments or gravel over the mineral soil; usually in steep terrain). On those sites where scree is prominent, the establishment of herbaceous vegetation is often slow and in such cases slashing may offer temporary control of competition. We caution, however, that the haphazard use of slashing may result in a significant first-year sprout response and that more than a single slashing treatment may be necessary on some sites.\n\nScalping has traditionally been done with hand tools (e.g., the planting hoe) at the time of planting to remove vegetation, duff, and scree from the planting spot and to expose the mineral soil. As currently practiced this treatment is not an effective means of controlling either herbaceous or evergreen hardwood competition. This is largely because of the cost associated with creating scalps larger than a square meter around each seedling, and the probable necessity for a follow-up treatment. In addition, evergreen hardwoods larger than a centimeter in diameter are difficult to remove by scalping.\n\nGrazing domestic livestock in new conifer plantations to control evergreen hardwoods has received relatively little research attention although a number of publications are available (Green and Newell 1982, Knipe 1983, Kosco and Bartolome 1983, Leininger 1983, Monfore 1983). Many foresters generally consider this as an unworkable vegetation management treatment because it results in livestock either browsing or trampling conifer seedlings. We feel that although grazing and reforestation have historically been considered incompatible, there may be some potential for this treatment alternative with additional research. Its applicability is likely to be limited to very specific types of site conditions, however.\n\nPaper mulches are used successfully to control grasses and other types of herbaceous vegetation in the immediate vicinity of conifer seedlings. Mulches may require annual maintenance or replacement, however, depending upon individual site conditions. They may be of use in suppressing seed germination, or in killing germinants or very young evergreen hardwoods but are impractical for use with sprouts. Discussions of this treatment can be found in Schubert (1976) and Greaves and Hermann (1978).\n\nIn addition to the preceding treatments we have identified, there are four other treatments we have previously referred to as supplemental which deserve brief mention. These treatments, although not designed to have a direct and immediate impact on evergreen hardwood competition, may influence the rate at which conifer seedlings become established and hence eventually dominate the site. In this respect they may play an important, although largely unquantified, role in vegetation dynamics. We refer to animal damage control treatments, the use of artificial shade and slow-release fertilizers, and the planting of genetically improved stock.\n\nDiscussions of animal damage control can be found in Greaves et al. (1978), Strothmann and Roy (1984), Campbell and Evans (1984), and Schaap and DeYoe (1986). Artificial shade has been shown to increase conifer seedling survival on south aspects. Strothmann and Roy (1984) correctly point out, however, that shade may not be necessary to successfully regenerate Douglas-fir, for example, on south slopes if all other facets of the reforestation process are favorable. Other summaries of artificial shade can be found in Greaves and Hermann (1978) and Helgerson and Bunker (1985). Recent reports have indicated that fertilizers applied to seedlings at the time of planting have a positive effect on growth (Strothmann 1980, Carlson andPreisig 1981). Preliminary results of a trial in southwest Oregon have shown that fertilized seedlings had almost double the first-year height growth of that measured for the untreated controls (O.T. Helgerson, pers. comm. 1986). Gains to be made in seedling growth from existing tree improvement programs are as yet unclear, but all indications are that they will be substantial. This impact will not influence timber management programs until large quantities of improved seed become available for large scale operational use.\n\nThe level of research devoted to the development of nonchemical treatments and strategies for the control of evergreen hardwoods is inadequate to meet future needs. This lack of information extends beyond evergreen hardwoods to most types of vegetation which compete with potential crop trees for limited resources. For many of the evergreen hardwood species we seek to manipulate, there is a significant void in our understanding of their ecophysiology and how they respond to various types of treatments. Only by developing a better understanding of these species can we hope to advance the science of vegetation management into such high-tech realms as biological control and genetic engineering. For the time being, however, a more realistic approach to the problem is to seek ways of using existing information to develop workable strategies and treatments tailored to specific site conditions. A good example of this is the perspective McDonald (1986) provides on the pros and cons of grass competition in young conifer plantations.\n\nIt has been shown that the control of evergreen hardwoods in young conifer plantations improves seedling growth and in some cases survival. Increasing restrictions on the use of herbicides have, however, made the management of these species more difficult and narrowed the margin for error in the reforestation process. Given our current level of knowledge, most nonchemical treatments are not as effective as herbicides.\n\nThey do, however, offer foresters with alternatives that show some potential. These treatments should be refined and integrated into a vegetation management strategy which enhances seedling performance and improves the probability of establishment. Only by expanding our understanding of the evergreen hardwood species we seek to manipulate can we hope to develop acceptable and cost-effective nonchemical treatments.\n\nEffects of Fire and Fire Suppression on Mortality and Mode of Reproduction of California Black Oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) 1 J. Boone Kauffman and R. E. Martin 2Historically, fire played a major role in shaping the composition and structure of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer ecosystems. Kilgore (1981) characterized the fire regime of mixed conifer forests as that of a frequent, low-intensity sur face fire with a mean fire return interval of 1 to 25 years. As such, it can be assumed that all native species present in this ecosystem developed adaptations to survive in this fire regime.\n\nAs a result of fire suppression, the mixed conifer forest of the present bears little resem blance to that of presettlement times (Biswell et al. 1973, Bonnicksen and Stone 1982, Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979). A century or more of fire suppression has resulted in unnatural accumulations of forest fuels, as well as the creation of a continuous vertical arrangement of fuels. This alteration in fuel dynamics has changed the fire regime from that of frequent, low-intensity surface fires to infrequent, high-intensity crown or stand replacement fires.\n\nOther changes due to fire suppression include alterations in the mosaic of the forest ecosystem (age structure, size and composition). These in clude increases in shade-tolerant conifers with a greater capacity to germinate in organic horizons. In addition, declines in the abundance of California black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) have occurred (Bonnicksen andStone 1982, Parsons andDeBenedetti 1979). 1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California.\n\n2 Assistant Professor of Rangeland Resources, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon; and Professor of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California, Berkeley, California. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Numerous studies, historical accounts and archaeological evidence suggest that the historical density and abundance of black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) in mixed conifer forests was much greater than today. Reasons for the decline of this species are unknown. However, it is well known that fire suppression since the late 1800's has drastically changed the composition and structure of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. Among the major changes that have occurred is the unnatural accumulation of fuels in an ecosystem with a historical fire regime characterized as that of frequent light surface fires with a mean return interval of 1 to 25 years. Results of this study found that established black oaks were well adapted for survival and resprouting following frequent low intensity/low consumption fires of the past; but not for high intensity/high consumption fires that are possible today. Removal of this heavy organic horizon by prescribed fire resulted in a 2-to 15fold increase in the number of black oak seedlings for the next 2 years.\n\nThe reasons for the decline in black oak are un known. However, in many communities of the mixed conifer zone, fire may be necessary for the main tenance of black oak in the composition. We hypoth esize that fire may affect black oak reproduction in two general ways. The primary effects are those on established individuals from evolution of heat during the combustion process. Depending on severity, environment, and plant factors, fire may result in crown mortality and resprouting, or death to both aboveground and below ground plant organs. The secondary effects are related to the post-fire habitat. Fire may influence the imme diate habitat of germinating acorns by increasing the amount of solar insolation and nutrients available to the plant, or by destruction of allelopathic compounds, fungi or other pathogens. Conversely, the loss or decrease of organic horizons may decrease survival of acorns due to increased exposure or predation. The interaction of wildlife, fire and acorn germination, if any, is also unclear.\n\nObjectives of this study were to: (1) document the relationship between fuel consumption (fire severity) and survival of resprouting black oaks, and ( 2) describe the relationship between the composition and biomass of the forest floor (duff layers or organic horizons) and black oak germination.\n\nTwo study sites were established in mixed conifer stands of the northern Sierra Nevada of California. The study sites are located at the Blodgett Forest Research Station near Georgetown, California, and the Massak unit of the Quincy Ranger District, Plumas National Forest. Hereafter, these locations will be referred to as the Blodgett and Quincy sites, respectively. Prior to burning, fuel loads ranged from 131 to 177 t ha -1 . Organic horizons accounted for 60 to 80 percent of the total fuel load. Slopes were nearly level (<10%), elevation was 1300 m and mean annual precipitation was approximately 1700 mm.\n\nThe Quincy area was characterized as an open stand of jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb] Franco) and incense cedar. Mean basal area of the overstory was 48.0 m 2 ha -1 . Soils were classified into the Holland Family, Basic (fine-loamy, mixed Ultic Haplo eralfs). Prior to burning fuel loads ranged from 75 to 102 t ha -1 . Slopes varied in steepness from 35 to 75 percent, elevation was 1350 m and mean annual precipitation is 900 mm.\n\nAt each location, six 0.25-ha blocks with four treatment units per block were established. The treatments include four different prescribed burns of varying season and consumption levels and a control (no burn). Burn treatments include an early spring -moderate consumption burn, a late spring -high consumption burn, an early fallhigh consumption burn, and a late fall -moderate consumption burn. The date of burn, environmental conditions and fuel consumption can be found in table 1.\n\nSurvival of the existing shrub component was estimated by randomly tagging 15 to 50 individuals in each treatment unit in each block prior to burning (1983). Shrubs were examined for mortality and survival the next two years after burning (1984,1985).\n\nDensity of oak seedlings was calculated by two measurements in 15 2m2, permanent plots in each treatment subunit of each block. These plots were measured prior to burning (1983) and the second growing season after fire (1985).\n\nFuel loads and consumption were measured by planar intercept (Brown 1974). Four permanent transects were established in each treatment unit prior to burning. Duff depth and biomass were measured at 60 points in each of the subunits.\n\nSignificance among treatments was tested by an analysis of variance in an incomplete randomized block design. If a significant F value was found (P<.05) a Student-Newman-Kuel's test was utilized to determine where differences occurred.\n\nAs would be expected, the high fuel consumption burns (early fall and late spring treatments) re sulted in the highest rates of mortality for the established black oak shrubs (table 2). However, all burn treatments resulted in significantly higher mortalities (significantly lower rates of survival in table 2) than the control. Though there were inherent differences between the two locations, the general patterns of decreasing survival with increasing fire severity were similar.\n\nFrom comparisons of survival between the two locations, it is apparent that survival rates at the Blodgett site were lower than those at Quincy, with the exception of the early spring treatment. This is attributed to two site factors. At the Blodgett site, the understory black oak component was significantly greater. The mean biomass of understory black oak individuals ranged from 163 to 320 g at Quincy and from 3 to 11 g at Blodgett (Kauffman 1986). At all sites, shrubs in the smaller size classes were most susceptible to fireinduced mortality. The majority of black oaks in small size classes predisposed the Blodgett black oak population to higher mortalities.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to higher mortalities was the fuel loadings and associated biomass of fuels consumed by fire. At the Blodgett site, significantly greater quantities of fuels were consumed and hence greater amounts of heat were generated at the base of the shrubs (table 2). Exceptions include the early spring burn treatments. Mean lower duff (0a) moisture contents were 35 and 135 percent at Quincy and Blodgett, respectively (table 1). As a result, consumption of the duff layer was 50.6 and 11.1 t ha -1, respectively. Even though almost five times as much biomass was con sumed by fire at Quincy, the survival rates were equal. These data suggest difficulties in the prediction or comparison of mortality rates without prior quantification of the fuel load and consumption. But when comparing mortality rates at a single location, fuel consumption variables were most often the most significant factor in predicting shrub mortality (Kauffman and Martin 1985).\n\nTwo growing seasons after fire, black oak germinants began to appear in significantly greater densities in all burn treatments with the exception of the early spring treatment at the Blodgett location (table 3). In these treatments, the number of germinants was 2 to 10 times greater in the burn units than the unburned controls. As previously indicated, this burn did not signifi cantly reduce the biomass of the duff component. The post-fire biomass of the duff component in all other treatments was significantly less than control. Apparently, when the duff component was less than 38 t ha -1 , seedling establishment was enhanced.\n\nThe fuel loads of these mixed conifer sites represent an unnatural buildup of downed woody materials. The heat loads produced by the 124 combustion of 60 to 100 t ha -1 in high consumption burn treatments at Blodgett and 48 to 50 t ha -1 in high consumption burn treatments at Quincy were probably a rare occurrence prior to the era of suppression. The frequent surface fires of the past maintained fuel accumulations much lower than today. Therefore, presettlement fires probably affected the resprouting component much like the burn treatment which consumed only moderate amounts of fuels (i.e. 11 t ha -l as in the early spring burn at Blodgett). This low intensity, low consumption burn killed only the smallest of black oak individuals.\n\nResults of this study indicate that successful germination of acorns is enhanced in areas where the duff layers are weakly developed. These are the probable seedbed conditions in which the black oak evolved. Accumulations of forest floor fuels apparently represent degraded seedbed conditions for black oak.\n\nIt is doubtful that black oak is declining in all areas of the mixed conifer zone. At open sites with shallow soils (such as the Quincy site), black oak was found in all size classes. However, prescribed burns did increase the density of germinants at this site. In addition, a different situation existed at the Blodgett site. Black oak was not represented in all size classes. Rather it was only present as seedlings (<1 m in ht) or as very old decadent individuals. In the vicinity of the Blodgett site, there are archaeological sites where Indians ground acorns for consumption. This would suggest a past composition containing a significant amount of oaks. At this location, we suggest that black oak has declined in abundance just as it has at the Sequoia National Park (Bonnicksen andStone 1982, Parsons andDeBennedetti 1979) and Yosemite National Park (Anonymous 1971). The decline of black oak represents a degradation of the community diversity and structure of these communities. The resultant declines in the wildlife habitat values, aesthetic and cultural values should be considered.\n\nThe unnatural accumulations of downed fuels are not the only nor necessarily the major factor for the decline in black oak. Though black oak does not require a mineral seedbed, germination is en hanced by such. It is probable that it does require openings in the overstory through which sunlight can reach the ground. The historic fires created gaps in the canopy and maintained an open character of the stands resulting in greater amounts of sunlight reaching the forest floor. With fire suppression, canopy closure has occurred and a dense midstory of shade-tolerant conifers has developed. This has decreased the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor.\n\nReasons for the increase in the density of black oak seedlings in burn treatments are unknown. But it is apparent that the post-fire seedbed conditions enhanced the successful germination of black oak. The acorns do not require a thermal scarification treatment, nor are there any other dormancy mechanisms similar to those of the Arctostaphylos Adans. or Ceanothus L. genus. Therefore, this response is probably the result of modifications in the habitat which allowed for higher densities of seedlings to establish in burned plots.\n\nDecay of seeds by molds in duff and litter has been suggested as an explanation for pool seedling emergence (Parmeter 1977). Damping off can be decreased by burning duff and litter. Parmeter (1977) stated that it was likely that the often observed success of seedlings on burned seedbeds was due to removal of seed decay, damping off and seedling root rot fungi.\n\nOther factors were also observed to have in fluenced oak seedling densities. Undoubtedly, wildlife play a major role in acorn dispersal. Snow (1973) found that factors influencing the distribution of southern California oaks included concentration of coast live oak (Q. agrifolia Nee) around rock outcrops due to ground squirrels.\n\nMost of the black oak seedlings were thought to have originated from acorns deposited by seed caching animals (i.e. squirrels and stellar jays). Often seedlings were as far as 50 m in distance from the nearest acorn-producing tree. Apparently a symbiotic relationship between the squirrels and black oak exists as squirrels (Sciurius griseus and/or Tamiasciurus douglasii) also tended to benefit from this relationship. After germination many acorns that were still attached to the seedlings contained dormant embryos which were palatable to the squirrels at a period when few other seeds or acorns were present. Squirrels removed almost all of these attached acorns. This appeared to cause few adverse reactions to the established seedling except the loss of ability to resprout from the acorn.\n\nWhether animals preferred burned areas as cache sites or if the rate of acorn germination in burned environments is higher due to increased survival of the acorns, or some combination, is unknown. Additional investigations are needed to describe the animal-fire-acorn germination relationship.\n\nSeveral authors have stated that since the era of fire suppression, most mixed conifer communities have only been exposed to \"minor disturbance.\" We suggest that fire suppression in ecosystems with a fire return of 8 to 10 years is a major distur bance in itself. The vegetation composition and structure have been severely altered. The resul tant and inevitable fire, which in all likelihood will be a crown or stand replacement fire, is the ultimate result of this man-caused disturbance (i.e. fire suppression).\n\nAdaptations of plants to fire are better termed plant adaptations to certain fire regimes (Kilgore 1981). These results indicated that black oak is well adapted to the presettlement fire regime and environment in the mixed conifer zone of the Sierra Nevada. This includes frequent low-moderate intensity, surface fires and the resultant weakly developed organic horizons. In this study, few black oaks were killed by low consumption prescribed fires. High consumption burns that are possible today will kill high per centages of those black oaks in a shrub form.\n\nPrescribed burns should be implemented to consume moderate-low amounts of fuels where increases or maintenance of the black oak population is desired. In order to increase germination success, forest floor reductions to less than 20 to 40 t ha -1 are suggested. This may require a high consumption burn or several burns of lowmoderate consumption.\n\nBlack oak provides numerous values to society. It is very palatable to big game and domestic livestock. Numerous animals also utilize acorns as forage and the trees as nesting or roosting habitat. The tree also is of commercial value as a timber species. Newell (1983) stated that the greatest values of California oaks are the rich ness and diversity that they add to our ecosystems and to our lives beyond the value in a commodity sense. Fire may be necessary to maintain, increase or allow for the reinvasion of California black oak into many mixed conifer communities.\n\nVernard Lewis, W. Jan A. Volney, and James E. Milsteadfoot_10\n\nThe evergreen oak flora is an extensive and important resource in California. America north of Mexico has 68 species of oaks, of which 16 are native to California (Munz, 1970). In California, the dominant evergreen oak is the Coast Live Oak, Quercus agrifolia. Quercus species grow on 15-20 million acres making them one of the largest, although under-utilized, natural resources in the state (Callaham, 1980). Leaf distribution, foliage damage and defoliator number models are exiguous or nonexistent.\n\nIn California, the principal insect herbivore of the Coast Live Oak is the California Oakworm, Phryganidia californica Packard (Furniss and Carolin, 1977). This insect is a native California species whose populations erupt sporadically, every 5 to 7 years, in the state (Harville, 1955). Oakworms feed almost exclusively on oaks: all native and many introduced species are susceptible (Koehler et al., 1978). The population dynamics (Sibray, 1947;Harville, 1955;and Young, 1977), nutritional ecology (Volney et al., 1983a;Puttick, 1986), sex pheromone (Hochberg and Volney, 1984) and frass-drop measurement\n\n1 Presented at the Multiple-Use Management of Symposium on California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California.

Abstract: A single Coast Live Oak tree (Quercus agrifolia) from Marin County California was selected for modelling the distribution of leaves, damaged foliage and the number of California Oakworms (Phryganidia californica). Branches for the study tree were classified according to crown level and compass direction. Twenty-four each branches were randomly selected, terminal shoot tagged. Resulting data collected per tagged shoot included number of leaves (damaged and undamaged) and oakworm larvae. Numbers of damaged and undamaged leaves, varied with crown level and branch diameter. Modelling showed leaf totals and oakworm of counts little difference when compared with The totals from field observations. aspects ecological and pest management of results are discussed. (Volney et al., 1983b) have been studied in some detailed. Still many gaps remain in our knowledge of this pest's biology, behavior and ecology.\n\nModelling urban pest populations is a recent innovation that is still undergoing development. The greatest advances in modelling are in agriculture (Getz and Gutierriez, 1982) and forestry (Waters and Stark, 1980). Early attempts of modelling shade-tree defoliator systems were by Olkowski et al., 1978. However, no data was presented revealing the number of leaves, foliage damage nor number of insect defoliators. Here, Q. agrifolia leaves from a study tree were counted to produce a model which allows for projections of foliage damage and numbers of E. californica.\n\nA Coast Live Oak tree, Q. agrifolia Nee, was selected for sampling from Marin Municipal Water District land near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County California. All major branches 15 mm in diameter or larger were grouped into three size categories. Every major branch was tagged and assigned to the crown location from which its foliage was borne. These crown locations were obtained by stratifying the crown into three vertical levels and into four compass directions. Vertical levels were obtained by dividing the tree canopy into three equal upright positions. Level 1 being the nearest the ground, Level 2 midcrown height and Level 3 the uppermost third of the crown. Compass direction was defined using standard designations (e.g., north, east, south and west).\n\nThe branch selection method employed for this study was a randomized design adapted from Jessen (1955). Each selected branch was followed by climbing and use of ladders until a fork along the limb was reached. At the fork, the choice as to which lateral limb was to be followed was based on a probability distribution of the cross-sectional branch diameter. At each selection stage, the branch selection probability was recorded. The process was continued until a terminal leaf cluster was reached, later being tagged with weather resistant identifying labels for future observations. This process was repeated two times per crown sampling quadrant, resulting in a total of 24 tagged shoots per tree.\n\nTagged leaf clusters were visited monthly for one year (February 1985(February -1986) ) to make observations on:\n\n1. Total number of leaves. 2. Total number of leaves damaged by oakworms (other defoliator species were excluded). 3. Total number of oakworm larvae.\n\nThese observations were made from ladders at the periphery of the crown.\n\nIn February 1986, 22 randomly selected branches (32 -72 mm in diameter) were excised from the sample tree and brought back to the laboratory. All leaves from field collected branches were sorted into damaged and undamaged categories, their totals recorded and entered into a computer. All data manipulations and statistical testing (Chi-Squared, t-test, F-test, Regression and ANOVA) were accomplished using the Statistical program StatView (Feldman and Gagnon, 1985) on an Apple MacIntosh computer.\n\nMean totals for field collected leaves are presented in Table 1. Total oak leaf numbers increased proceeding up the crown of the tree. These results were shown to be statistically significant. Controlling for crown level differences, damaged and undamaged leaf totals were greatest for branches 49 -64 mm in diameter, Table 2. All row means were statistically significant.\n\nAlthough studies exist for other hardwood species (Red Maple, Acer rubrum L.) which disclose foliage and defoliator distribution patterns (Volney, 1979), no attempts were made to estimate actual leaf counts. From the current study, the majority of leaves (damaged and undamaged) were found in the upper two-thirds of the crown. The percentage of damaged leaves (75 percent) was high compared to defoliator damage for other oak species (Puttick, 1986). Compass direction and leave growth patterns were not statistically correlated. However, data from a larger tree sample (nine trees) shows differences in leaf counts (Lewis, 1986). As previously reported, oak leaves survive at least 2 years on shoots. The peak leaf flushing period being, March-April.\n\nOf particular research interest, is estimating the number of oakworm causing visual damage. Published findings forward conflicting values. A CIAS pamphlet (CIAS, 1981) states larval densities of 0.5 per shoot as not causing appreciable damage. Yet other workers report complete defoliation at larval densities of 1 per shoot (Volney for et al., 1983a). indicate\n\nthis study larval densities of 3 per shoot resulted in total defoliation (Lewis, 1986). The discrepancies in insect counts may be due to varying sampling designs and the difficulty of randomly sampling trees, especially in the higher crown levels.\n\nNutritional ecology studies conclude older oak leaves are less digestible, particularly late in the summer (Feeny, 1970). This decrease in digestibility is due to increases in Tannin content and leaf toughness. Concurrently, protein availability is diminishing as leaves approach maturity. Similar results were obtained for Q. agrifolia (Puttick, 1985). Because of this process, larval feeding and leaf damage are accelerated as oakworms obtain their nutritional requirements for growth and development. Given this to be true, fewer larvae than expected may cause significant defoliation in the summer compared to the spring generation. However, longitudinal studies on field defoliation rates show elevated levels of Tannin to correlated poorly with protein decline (Faeth, 1985). This finding may explain the patchiness of defoliated trees observed in the field. It has been theorized that temperature or chemical and physical changes within damaged leaves are more important parameters in describing defoliation patterns (Faeth, 1985).\n\nReviewing previously mentioned data tables, most leaves show signs of damage (Tables 1, 2). Damage is greatest at the top of the crown. This is consistent with published reports of oakworm infestations starting at the top and proceeding down the crown (CIAS, 1981). The greatest leaf numbers are for branches 49-64 mm in diameter. It is not known why branches of this size have the more leaves. A possible explanation is that asymmetry of leaves on some branches is due to the asymmetry of sunlight on different compass directions. In Table 3, the model overestimated leaves in the lowest crown level (1). This is due to a bias in the model from more branches being located in level 1 compared to other levels. A weighted correction factor is needed when computing values. Predicted larval and field result are similar (Table 4). However, until the data from all nine sample trees are analyzed, generalizations would be premature.\n\nOakworm populations have been reported to sporadically outbreak. The causes for these outbreaks are unknown. Natural enemies are often cited as the cause for the cyclic demise of field larval populations.\n\nThe exact mechanism is unknown. One possible explanation forward is that at high population densities defoliation allows more light penetration. By reducing foliate surface parasites is area, host location by predators and easier. Another possible mechanism, is chemical and physical changes that occur in damaged leaves act as attractive lures for predators and parasites.\n\nRandom insecticidal treatments are of little benefit if parameters for success (e.g., undamaged leaves, reduced larval and egg counts) are dismissed. Since branch sampling high in the crown is laborious an easier and economical sampling protocol is needed. Frass-drop measurements provides the necessary variable inputs for quick and accurate estimates of insects and resulting damage (Morris, 1949). Oakworm Frass-drop experiments from the laboratory and field have been conducted (Volney et al., 1983b).\n\nReviewing these workers regression equations, the slope value of ( 1) imply an one-to-one relationship between leaf weight consumed (leaf damage) and weight of frass produced (monitoring tool reflecting damage). In depth refinement of this relationship by correlating leaf biomass consumed by oakworm with biomass lost by damaged leaves is needed. The intended result being, safe and efficacious control campaigns with minimal expense to the consumer and environment.\n\nJames E. Milstead, W. Jan A. Volney, and Vernard R. Lewis 2 Throughout its recorded range, which extends in California along the coastal mountains from San Diego County north to Humboldt County (Harville,''1955) and into Oregon (Wickman and Kline, 1985) the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica (Pack.), feeds primarily on Quercus, Lithocarpus and Castanopsis.\n\nThe oakworm characteristically occurs at low population densities which periodically increase to outbreak levels resulting in severe defolia tion to host trees (Furniss and Carolin, 1977).\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, there are usually 2 generations per year. Oviposition customarily occurs in June and July and again in October and November. First and early second instar larvae overwinter on the lower leaf sur face of California live oak (Quercus agrifolia Nee). During the winter months there is usually little feeding and, if the temperature remains low for an extended period, populations may suffer high mortality. A s the season progresses the developmental rate gradually rises in response to an increase in temperature. Because the distribution of host species (Harville, 1955;Griffin and Critchfield, 1972) clearly extends beyond the limits of the occurrence of sustained oakworm populations, it is probable that temperature and relative humidity are the major abiotic limiting factors. Within areas where temperature extremes allow the continued presence of oakworm populations, older instars may be found feeding at the margins of leaves of all age classes during the spring, summer and fall months.\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Calif. 2 Staff Research Associate, Division of Entomology and Parasitology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif.; Research Scientist, Canadian Forest Service, Northern Forestry Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Graduate Student, Division of Entomology and Parasitology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Foliage consumption, frass production, assimilation efficiency and developmental rate are influenced by ambient temperature, sex, larval population density and the quality of host leaves. The larval feeding threshold lies between 1.7 and 4.4°C. The temperature optimum for larval development is approximately 20°C. Males have shorter larval and longer pupal periods and emerge shortly before females. Both high larval population density and leaf matura tion tend to depress consumption and assimilation values and result in the production of smaller adults associated with diminished fecundity.\n\nAlthough it is associated with a large complement of natural enemies few quantitative assessments of their impact have been reported. Harville (1955) working with oakworm populations at Alum Rock Park in San Jose and Jasper Ridge at Palo Alto attributed approximately 20 percent of the observed mortality to the combined action of the predatory bug Podisus and the tachnid Actia and 50-75 percent to the parasitic wasps Brachymeria and Itoplectis. Later work by Horn (1974) reaffirmed the importance of these pupal parasites and related the parasitization percentage to pupal population density. Recently, Young (1980) showed that Itoplectis operates in a density dependent manner over host densities ranging from 6 to 13 pupae per m 2 while above this density the parasitization rate declines. The effectiveness of these primary pupal parasites may be reduced by as much as 63 percent through the action of secondary parasites (Horn, 1974).\n\nThe major pathogens, excluding the microbial control agent Bacillus thuringiensis; are protozoan and viral. Infection levels of 33-35 percent for Nosema and approximately 2 percent for Leidyana have been reported for an Orcutt population sampled between 1958and 1960(Lipa and Martignoni 1960, 1984). While the field incidence of viral infections has not been quan tified, Harville (1955) regarded viral disease to be a primary mortality factor exceeded in importance only by mass starvation. Martignoni and Schmid (1961) by means of laboratory bio assays have demonstrated significant differences in viral resistance between oakworm population at Albany and Orcutt and suggested that tolerance, population density and the presence of the virus and its inductors may account for the recurrence of virus epizootics. Because susceptibility to infectious organisms is determined in part by body weight and pathogen dosage, feeding rates may be a major factor influencing mortality in natural populations.\n\nThe nutritive quality of host foliage has been reported to decline with leaf aging (Mattson, 1980) and in response to herbivore feeding (Shultz and Baldwin, 1982).\n\nThe effect of food quality and larval population density on oakworm foliage consump tion has been previously reported (Volney et al., 1983). The current study, an extension of that work covering both spring and summer generations, uses herbivore dry weights in computing nutritional indices and considers the influence of gender in oakworm herbivory.\n\nI n the initial experiments extending from February through August, 1981, third instar larvae were fed in 600 ml. waxed paper cups. The larvae had free access to weighed leaves which were changed 3 times per week. Leaf moisture was maintained by means of a cottonplugged water-filled vial in which the excised leaf was inserted. Undamaged mature current flush (new) leaves and those from the previous (old) flush were selected from each of 2 trees differing in their oakworm infestation levels (sparse = less than 0.05 larvae per shoot; high = ca. 1.0 larvae per shoot). Initial population densities were 1, 2 and 4 larvae per feeding arena. Laboratory temperature and relative humidity was monitored by means of a hygrothermo graph. Mean temperature ranged from 18.4°C to 24.5°C. Mean relative humidity ranged from 35.1 percent to 45.6 percent.\n\nIn later experiments (1986) utilizing foliage taken from 2 sparsely infested trees, growth rates were compared on newly flushed (immature) leaves and the preceeding [sic] generation's mature leaves. First instar larvae were reared singly at 20°C and 58 percent relative humidity in 13 dram plastic vials. The leaves fed to the larvae were changed 3 times per week. No attempt was made to maintain leaf moisture in these experiments. When adults emerged, clean vials were used as mating arenas. Leaves were changed 3 times per week to provide an ovipositional stimulus.\n\nConsumption rates and utilization efficiencies were determined by means of the methods previous ly reported (Volney et al., 1983). All leaves were weighed prior to feeding (fresh weight) and the dry weights of leaf remnants and frass were obtained after a 24 hour ovenization at 105°C. Foliage consumption (I) was determined by subtracting the weight of the leaf remnant from the dry weight of the original leaf estimated from the regression relationship: (oven dry weight = 13.425 + 0.517 fresh weight; r 2 = 0.92; P = 0.0001).\n\nThe dry weight gain (G) was computed by subtracting the initial estimated dry weight of the larvae (larval dry weight = 0.356 + 0.151 larval wet weight; r 2 = 0.92; P = 0.001) from the estimated dry weight of the pupae (pup al dry weight = -3.6 + 0.273 pupal wet weight; r 2 0.95; P = 0.001).\n\nThe population density (D) in the feeding products of the number of live larvae (N) in each feeding period and its duration (t) by the total duration (T). (D = NT/T).\n\nThe mean weight (W) was obtained by dividing the sum of the products of the initial weight (w) of the larvae entering the feeding period (t) by T. (W = wt/T).\n\nThe following consumption and utilization rates were derived:\n\nWithin the range of temperatures that allow survival (table 1) the population dynamics of the California oakworm is affected by many natural enemies (table 2).\n\nLeaf age; the impact of herbivory (reflected in host infestation level), larval population density and sex are among many factors reported to influence consumption and utilization rates (Scriber and Slansky, 1981;Schowalter et al., 1986).\n\nThe results of feeding trials with immature leaves from the current flush, mature leaves from the current flush, and mature leaves from an earlier flush are presented in tables 3-5. The assimilation values fall within the ranges reported for lepidopterous larvae feeding on tree foliage (Slansky and Scriber, 1982).\n\nA diet of immature leaves is associated with more rapid developmental rates, larger insects and enhanced egg productivity (table 5). Larvae feeding on older mature leaves have lower CR and AD values.\n\nNo significant differences in developmental rate or insect size can be attributed to leaf age differences in mature leaves.\n\nAs in the case with mature leaves, infestation level differences are not reflected in signifi cant differences in consumption rate, nutritional efficiency, development or size.\n\nFemale larvae have appreciably higher CR, FR, GR, ECI and ECD values. These along with a longer larval period result in larger pupae and adults. Male larvae have higher AD values and a more rapid developmental rate.\n\nAt the highest population density, all of the consumption and assimilation values with the exception of ECD are drastically depressed resulting in the production of smaller pupae and adults.\n\nLeaf aging is associated with a decline in Nitrogen and water concentrations (Scriber and Slansky, 1981). Young, actively growing tissues contain the highest levels of Nitrogen (Puttick, 1986) and, as the growth rate begins to diminish the Nitrogen concentration drops sharply, decreasing gradually thereafter until just prior to senescence. Both ECI values and relative growth rates have been shown to be correlated with leaf Nitrogen and water content (Mattson, 1980;Scriber, 1978Scriber, , 1984)). These correlations serve to explain our observations relating leaf age and herbivore response throughout the growing season where the greatest differences occur between oakworm larvae feeding on young foliage and those feeding on mature leaves.\n\nIn contrast, Puttick has reported higher GR, ECI and ECD values for oakworm larvae feeding on mature leaves of Q. agrifolia. Since neither gender differences nor the influence of leaf age on growth rate and fecundity were considered it is difficult to compare her findings with those presented here.\n\nWhile it is known that herbivory can result in the mobilization of facultative defenses in host trees (Schowalter et al., 1986) our data, derived from the feeding of mature leaves, gives only slight indication of this. The phenomenon may be more readily descernable [sic] in actively growing leaves sampled from trees exhibiting higher levels of infestation.\n\nDisparities in weight between male and female larvae, pupae and adults have been attributed to differences in the length of the developmental period, a faster relative consumption rate and a higher ECI (Scriber and Slansky, 1981). Our data support these findings. While the CI values are essentially equal for the sexes, female larvae consume foliage at a faster rate over a longer period of time.\n\nThe slower developmental rate of female larvae suggests that the application of microbial insecticide during the last instar, while not affording current foliage protection, should serve to greatly reduce the population base of the succeeding generation.\n\nOur data indicate that at high population densities increased intraspecific competition for food results in the production of smaller adults with lessened fecundity. This is supported by data (Milstead, unpublished) collected during two oakworm outbreaks in 1982 and 1986 where severe defoliation was associated with diminished oakworm size and fecundity.\n\nIt is clear from these results that foliage quality and population density can have profound consequences on the population dynamics of the oakworm.  1 Values within a group followed by * and ** are significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 level respectively.\n\n2 Larval instars 1 and 2 excluded.\n\n136 1 Values within a group followed by * and ** are significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 level respectively.\n\n2 Larval-instars 1 and 2 excluded.\n\nTable 5--Influence of Leaf Maturity on Weight, Duration of Developmental Period and Egg Production 1\n\n1 Values within a row followed by * and ** are significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 level respectively.\n\nBailey Hudson 2\n\nThe urban forest can be defined simply as the planted environment within the city. Collectively it includes trees, shrubs and lawns in urban parks, public areas, private yards and commercial and industrial areas-the overall green environment. It is a people-oriented forest designed to provide a quality living environment and enhance the social, cultural, sensory and economic dimensions of urban life.\n\nThe urban forest also has ecological value. It modifies the environment in a positive way by\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California. 2 Superintendent of parks, California Urban Forests Council, Santa Maria, California.

It can also modify the environment negatively when it requires more energy and water resources to maintain than are reasonably available in the long term. The measure of the forest's value would be in how well the positive benefits are balanced with the consumptive requirements.\n\nUrban forestry functions are influenced by a variety of professional and lay backgrounds that are extremely diverse. Involved are scientists, engineers, activists, politicians, landscape architects, urban planners, practitioners, and many others who ultimately affect the character and management of urban vegetation. Considering the myriad professionals and lay people involved in urban forestry and the variety of urban forest values, we must employ an eclectic system of management for urban vegetation. To perpetuate the values of urban forestry, urbanites must understand the urban forest complex collectively as an ecosystem. Further, the urban forester must practice multiple-use, sustained yield management for people. The city tree, which is the largest and most impressive statement in the urban landscape, will receive the most attention from the papers in this section.\n\nJulie K. Oxford 2The urban forest has been broadly defined as trees and forested areas in the city, suburban areas and small woodlots outside the traditional wildlands. As California's burgeoning population pushes urban development onto woodland areas, the urban forest takes on new characteris-ics, and its caretakers take on new responsibilities: No longer do these urban forests resemble the typical urbanscape of ornamental trees and shrubs; rather, these urbanized woodlands, comprised of nature's indigenous species, are indeed another type of urban forest, requiring altogether different regimes of cultivation and care.\n\nThe professional urban forester is involved in the scientific management, protection and regeneration of the urban forest. Forestry programs which identify these objectives are critical not only to cities and communities but to recreational areas--the forested interfaces whose survival depends directly on the wise use and proper management by its human caretakers.\n\nManagement techniques of the urban forester, tested successfully on city lots and corridors, are not readily applicable, however, to the ecology of an oak-woodland: Oaks are adapted to summer droughts and seasonal winter rains, a mediterranean climatic regime unlikely to be consistent with that of an abutting ornamental landscape installed by an urban neighbor.\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14,1986, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Calif. 2 ACORN Project Coordinator, Natural Resources Management, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Calif. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Oak-woodlands and wildlands are converted into urbanized developments and recreational areas at an alarming rate, often with little or no understanding of the resulting impacts to these areas. This trend, together with the public's general lack of awareness of California's oak regeneration problem, is rationale for promoting urban forestry programs at the community level, to educate the public on the protection of these forests. This paper highlights one such urban forestry project--ACORN--designed to aid the declining valley oak at Lopez Lake Recreational Area in southern San Luis Obispo County. The ACORN newsletter was then published, serving to establish a statewide \"information network\" to further the dissemination of technical information on managing California's hardwood forests.\n\nThe human element, residing or recreating in increasing numbers among the oak-woodlands, has introduced new challenges to the management of these fragile forest areas, imparting as yet unknown factors to the ecological dynamics of the forest. New techniques are being developed and updated with each experimental urban forestry program. Skilled, technical management implemented by the professional urban forester, however, has little merit if long-term maintenance practices of uninformed residents and recreationists of that community persist.\n\nTo offset this problem of counterproductive management practices, an urban forester can introduce educational programs to residents of a forest community. In so doing, he can function not merely as an espouser of sound scientific management, but as a leader supporting his methods with values which can be broadly contagious within a locality: those of aesthetics, environmental concerns and community pride. For urban forestry programs to sustain and perpetuate themselves, forest management in populated or recreational areas requires the awareness and cooperation on the part of the community in which it is based.\n\nConcern about the lack of knowledge and wise manage-ment of California's oaks led to the development of ACORN--The Association for California Oak Resource News. Aided by a grant from the Conservation Endowment Fund and other supporting groups and individuals, the Natural Resources Management Department of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo served as headquarters for the program, providing a director, a project coordinator and a faculty advisory committee. Together we established ACORN's mission: (1) to generate public awareness of the oak-regeneration problem with hands-on community involvement of oak-planting and protection and (2) to create an information network for the purpose of disseminating hardwoodrelated updates and information by publishing a newsletter and other educational materials. The intent is that the public--by taking an active role in local urban forestry activities--will become better informed of the state's oak-regeneration problem, and will then be better able to make decisions regarding the future of California's hardwood forests.\n\nThe valley oaks (Quercus lobata Neé) at Lopez Lake Recreational Area, Arroyo Grande, have been declining due to a combination of factors: Edaphic, physiologic and wildlife relationships and soil compaction are factors being investigated by the park. In cooperation with the park management, ACORN's oak planting project was designed to regenerate the oaks in the recreational area. December 7, 1985 more than 200 volunteers from the community planted 1500 valley oak acorns on four acres of the oak-woodland site.\n\nBefore embarking on a particular program, targets, such as groups representing strong bases echoing the voice of the county, were earmarked to assess probable pathways to support. In the case of San Luis Obispo, a strong slowgrowth sentiment echoes throughout this largely agricultural county; its residents boast a strong pride in maintaining and protecting the beauty and simplicity of its rural countryside. ACORN was welcomed by literally every group encountered.\n\nThe Media A major event affecting the status of the community generated momentum for the ACORN PROJECT. Ironically, five months before the project was to begin, the proposed site, the recreational area at Lopez Lake, narrowly escaped the 75,000-acre Las Pilitas Fire, charring the lake's perimeters. Capitalizing on the timing of an otherwise devastating event, ACORN's press releases were mailed to county newspapers, all eight of whom were eager to promote an oak-regeneration project which, they wrote, offered at least a partial solution to recover the damage effected by the midsummer fire. Our public service announcements were aired county-wide, the result: ACORN's message was carried repeatedly over six radio stations. Thus, on the \"coattails\" of the fire, an intensive community outreach program was well underway, as volunteers began calling daily, offering assistance to the regeneration project.\n\nPress releases and letters of introduction were mailed to civic and community groups thought to have a special interest in our project, the response being that our regeneration project was highlighted in more than a dozen newsletters and leaflets published by organizations such as University of California Cooperative Extension; California Native Plant Society; Sierra Club; Audubon; Natural History Association; Sportsmen's Association; Wildlife Rehabilitation Guild; 4-H clubs; FFA; Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts--all of whom were represented at the planting. Slideshow presentations offered these organizations a visual introduction to the project, emerging as one of the most effective educational tools for garnering community support.\n\nEach community has public figures, civic and private spokespeople who seek to affiliate themselves with community service projects. Non-partisan urban forestry programs are ideal functions in which to involve local dignitaries. ACORN flourished from its ad hoc consortium of celebrated supporters. Among the roster of invited speakers and dignitaries honored at the ceremony were the mayor of Arroyo Grande; San Luis Obispo County Agricultural Commissioner; representatives from the County Board of Supervisors; County Parks Facilities Manager; representatives from the USDA-Forest Service, California Department of Forestry, University of California Cooperative Extension and the California Conservation Corps.\n\nCommunity networking was self-perpetuating, as word of our mission traveled. Sunset magazine photographed ACORN's planting activity and carried an editorial in their May 1986 issue. The Journal of Forestry publication gave us national coverage and a local television station broadcast the community planting. ACORN was also selected as a finalist in the National Arbor Day Foundation Awards.\n\nA computerized database was essential as our base grew to 1200 supporters, half of whom were residents of San Luis Obispo county. Statewide hardwood research rosters were sought. Requests for mailing lists of members of civic and community groups were met with strong resistance; bylaws protecting the privacy of those lists are strictly enforced. Despite this setback, many such members attended slide presentations introducing ACORN, and became active promoters and supporters of the project.\n\nACORN's success effected a growing database, indicating a strong support system. A newsletter was published, highlighting the success of the urban forestry project, communicating objectives and offering updates of oak-related events, research and a punctuated bibliography of books and articles of interest. The timing of a newsletter, fitting it in where it best sustains the growing momentum-may be crucial to keeping a project alive. Unforseen [sic] difficulties rendered the ACORN publication months late in its delivery, the effects of which are difficult to postulate.\n\nA group of some 200 volunteer planters arrived at the selected park site, Vista Lago Island. Youth groups had been organized who set up booths depicting historic acorn use by the indigenous Chumash, and several species of oak seedlings were available for purchase. A brochure was distributed, which outlined our acorn planting technique and described the problems associated with the oaks' unsuccess-ful regeneration locally and statewide. Bluegrass minstrels led the group to a clearing under several aging valley oaks, where a dedication ceremony and planting demonstration readied the groups for action. Cal Poly forestry clubs provided leadership, forming groups, each taking acorns and planting gear with them to the nearby planting site.\n\nA special technique had been developed for planting acorns at the park, ensuring their protection. Wildlife species, known to inhabit the oak-woodland site, were a primary consideration: Among the 150 avian species observed around the lake, the locally abundant acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) feeds voraciously on the valley oak acorns. The California ground squirrel (Spermophilis beecheyi) and the valley pocket gopher (Thomomys bottas) are among some 28 species of small mammals known to occur near the planting site. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) roam freely throughout the park. Protection from annual grassland mowing, one of the park's measures for maximizing fire protection, was also a consideration.\n\nHoles of 2-feet depth had been prepared in advance by the California Conservation Corps, using gas-powered augers. A piece of aviary netting (1/2-inch-mesh) was rolled into a cylinder, 2-feet-high, 5-inches in diameter. Overlapping edges were threaded through the solid mesh, securing a closed unit, except for the top 6 inches, which were kept open temporarily, for planting access. The base was bent inward, forming a lid closure to prevent rodents entering from underground. The cylinder was then located so that it protruded 6 inches above the ground and was filled to within 2 inches of the ground surface with \"native\" soil and soil amendment, in equal proportions. After firmly tamping the soil to remove air spaces, five acorns were layed on their sides and 2 inches of soil gently firmed over them. The top 6 inches of netting were then threaded closed and the cylinder top bent inward, forming a lid to discourage above-ground foragers. Numbered aluminum labels were secured to each cage and berms were formed to allow for deep irrigation.\n\nIntending for the seedlings to be without cultivation, Lopez park personnel watered the oak seedlings just twice the first year, and only during a prolonged seasonal drought. Six months after planting, a work party was organized to tend to the seedlings. A count determined that 98.9 percent of the planting sites had at least one surviving seedling. To minimize competition for water, light and root space, the sites were cleared of weeds. The berms were rebuilt and the cages, which the seedlings had outgrown, were extended to a height of four feet and a width of three feet.\n\nIn eight month's time, the city and portions of the county of San Luis Obispo were to become whole-hearted support-ers of ACORN in its efforts to aid the non-regenerating hardwood resource in their community. Through extensive use of the media, a highly effective public relations campaign was launched. Slideshow presentations were developed; as educational tools, these interpretives promoted awareness within civic and community groups, conservation and youth organizations. A site was selected for the oak-regeneration project, where a dedication ceremony was attended by more than 200 members of the community, including community leaders and dignitaries, each planting a tree in their honor. A newsletter was then published, highlighting the success of the ACORN PROJECT, further promoting awareness of the problems threatening California's hardwood forests.\n\nThe success of ACORN's urban forestry program is owed, in large part, to our developing an educational package which was tailored to the personal needs of the community it intended to serve: By researching and targeting those groups most suited to our goals, and by making personal appearances at numerous meetings, our educational presentations could be adapted to each group's special interests. While personal appearances helped introduce our program, distributing printed material left our message in their hands.\n\nNetworking the community media in person stirred an interest in the editorial staff, who, by virtue of their profession, are always looking for a story! Small budgets require large support systems: We asked for support in the form of air time, press and community participation--the three ingredients most important to the success of the ACORN PROJECT: The media spoke to our efforts, thus uniting the community for a worthy cause; the overwhelming community response reflected back the certainty that ACORN's mission had indeed reached its first stronghold.\n\nAlex A. Pancheco 2 California's hardwood resource has felt the impact of the activities of man since before the arrival of Western civilization. Native Americans utilized acorns and other hardwood products in their everyday life. With the Spanish colonization in the 1700's, the resource began to be negatively affected, as more trees were cut for firewood, and as cattle were introduced to the landscape. Since then, development and accelerating urban influences have increased the pressure. Today, while many do not agree on the ultimate reason for some oaks' failure to regenerate properly, or what impact the removal of cattle grazing would have on regeneration, or the adequacy of current regulations in protecting the resource, there is a common denominator. The basic problem is people and their attitudes.\n\nThe economic and social activities of humans in California, and the pressures that they have placed on the hardwood resources are the primary reason that we are here today. Since people are causing the problem, it follows by extension that they must be the solution. It sounds simplistic, but the cure indeed will not be. The only way to ensure the wise use of our hardwoods is to change the way people view the nature of the resource. Too many take our hardwoods for granted, or ignore them altogether. Many others perceive them as a hindrance to their development plans. The public must begin to perceive California's hardwoods as a resource to be managed, utilized where practical and preserved when necessary. This increase in public awareness must come about through education and by involving the public in the management process. By involving private citizens in the issues of resource management, the public becomes better informed and can begin to support the resource manager. This has many advantages to the manager, from support\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California 2 Manager of Forestry Programs, TreePeople, Los Angeles, California. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Man's economic and social activities have long placed pressure on California's hardwood resource. This has resulted in significant modifications to the resource, especially near urban areas. Improvements in hardwood management will not occur unless the public begins to perceive hardwoods as a resource. TreePeople has worked for a number of years to change the public's perception of the resource through education and involvement in urban forestry. This paper will discuss some of TreePeople's methods and introduce our efforts to educate the public about hardwoods through our oak reforestation efforts.\n\nfor increased budgets by creating a visible constituency, to creation of volunteer corps that can assist in many of the actual facets of urban forestry.\n\nFor 15 years, TreePeople has taken the approach that public involvement in urban forestry is a good way to assist traditional resource managers by tackling projects that might otherwise not be attempted. Our success has been based upon the idea that people can make a difference and that they must be involved in solving problems relating to urban pressures upon our resources.\n\nWe have attempted to achieve this through a two fold process. First, through our education program, and second, through ongoing citizen involvement in urban and forest planting programs. In the rest of my presentation, I will discuss these approaches and introduce our oak reforestation efforts.\n\nOur education program is run along two main fronts. We reached over 20,000 kids last year alone, through both school assemblies and field trips to our park headquarters and environmental education center. That's 20,000 people that, when they grow up, will have an increased awareness of environmental issues, and be able to support the idea of urban forestry. And that doesn't include their teachers, parents or friends who were exposed to the same ideas. Many of these kids have never been aware of these issues before, but now each of them is a potential asset to the resource manager.\n\nEducation is not restricted to children alone. TreePeople has an active \"guest speaker\" program that covers a variety of topics--from global forestry issues to proper pruning methods. In addition, we conduct training sessions to give volunteers the skills needed to support traditional urban forest managers through our planting and maintenance programs.\n\nUtilizing the media is another way to \"educate\" the public. We have developed a number of public outreach campaigns, basing them upon resources available in the community rather than spending large amounts of money to get the point across. This is especially important today in the age of shrinking public budgets and private contributions. If well planned and guided, a campaign thus produced can provide much more exposure than a multi-million dollar advertising campaign, and result in far greater public involvement.\n\nTreePeople's success in these efforts has been based upon the method of using an issue that has a high public awareness factor to focus upon a single problem. Be it destructive brush fires, floods, air quality issues or an Olympic Games, the trick has been to use these highly visible occurrences to garner public support for programs specifically designed to tackle one issue. Let me focus on our largest campaign to date, the Million Tree Campaign. In 1981 TreePeople launched a campaign to inspire the planting of one million trees in the Los Angeles Basin before the start of the 1984 Olympics. The one million figure was based upon a city Planning Department report on the effect on air quality of massive tree planting in urban areas. The report concluded that one million trees, when they were 20 years old, would bring the Los Angeles area to within 80 percent of meeting the Clean Air Act Standard. The City's projected timeline for completion of such a project was 20 years at a cost of $200 million. Our setting a goal of 3 years, with a minimal budget, was viewed as being \"impossible\"--but it fired the public's imagination.\n\nUsing what we found in the community, we created a successful ad campaign that kept the issue before the public for those 3 years. While we ourselves accounted for only some 40,000 trees planted, the seed we planted produced a flood of public interest and support. The people took it upon themselves to help achieve this goal rather than wait for government to do it. By the time the Olympics opened, we had hit the mark. Based on planting confirmation cards, letters and phone calls we received from individuals and agencies, more than one million trees were planted due to this campaign, at a savings to city and county governments of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nRecently, our efforts have taken on a new approach. That is to keep the public inspired and involved in urban forestry issues even without the impetus of a major event or cause to organize around. This is taking the shape of an ongoing series of training programs, called \"Citizen Foresters,\" in which we teach people from the community the skills needed to undertake the planting of trees in the urban areas of Los Angeles. By being closer to the needs of their individual communities, these people will be able to work to solve problems or take advantage of opportunities we at TreePeople may not have seen.\n\nTheir training consists of three basic parts:\n\n(1)how to plant and maintain trees in an urban environment, (2)how to develop plantings and (3)how to serve the community as an informal consultant on matters of urban forestry. The skills they learn include how to deal with the various levels of bureaucracy, site evaluation procedures, proper tree choices, how to organize a planting from start to finish, and where to look for what they need. Most importantly, they serve as a source of information and inspiration to the community, and can deal with the public on a much closer level than we could. By using their assistance, those neighborhoods that might otherwise abandon their plans to plant due to being rebuffed by the city, or being scared off by the amount of work involved, will be able to get their trees. In addition, this program will likely result in a savings to the city as the cost of new trees are borne directly by the community. This problem of not having a major event or cause to focus public attention upon (in organizing a campaign) has had repercussions in the management of hardwoods, primarily oaks, in the Los Angeles urban area. The pressure upon oaks in this area is primarily from rapidly expanding development. Large oaks continue to fall as new housing moves farther out into prime oak woodland. This pressure has begun to seriously threaten the population of the Valley Oak (Quercus lobata Nee), as the best oak sites are often the most desirable from a development standpoint. Valley Oak regeneration in many parts of Southern California has basically ceased to keep up with the pace of mortality, as much due to removal of land from \"circulation\" as from any other factor.\n\nThe response from the public has been mixed. Education is needed to increase awareness of the threat to local hardwoods, especially the Valley Oak. Some segments of the population have changed their response from apathy to concern. These are people who are either more environmentally attuned or who are more aware of oaks due to having lived with them in their area. Many have become aware as mature oaks maintained in the urban environment after development have begun to decline, or have died as the combined injuries due to soil compaction, paving, smog and excess watering become too severe. Some organized groups such as the Oak Tree Coalition and the Sierra Club have taken stands against the further removal of oaks. Legislation has been enacted to attempt to protect existing oaks threatened by development, and require their replacement if removed. On some occasions, heavy fines have been levied against those convicted of illegal cutting. As far as ensuring a new generation of oaks however, not much had been done.\n\nOur concern at TreePeople was that the rapid decline in numbers of the mature Valley Oak would threaten the population's ability to regenerate naturally. The efforts of one of our staff members, who was not even directly involved in our forestry programs, led to an attempt to see if artificial regeneration could be used to get seedlings established past the critical 4-5 year period in which many natural trees seem to fail. We contacted the NPS (National Park Service), who manage quite a bit of existing oak habitat as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n\nA site was selected in Cheseboro Canyon, just outside Agoura. The NPS acquired 1,800 acres of former ranch land here in 1982, with a further 300 acres purchased in 1985. The hardwoods located here are fairly clearly distributed according to geologic and topographic factors. Valley Oaks are scattered along the banks of Cheseboro Creek and in pockets of deep alluvium across the valley floor. Coast Live Oaks (Quercus agrifolia Nee) are found mostly on the slopes above the valley floor, especially on the north facing slopes. At the mouth of the canyon, live oaks dominate the drier sites, with scattered California Sycamores (Platanus racemosa Nutt.) found on the pockets of poorest soil. Black Walnut (Juglans californica Wats.) is found in the canyon, but only on areas of weak unstable shales on the north facing slopes.\n\nValley Oak regeneration was basically nonexistent. Heavy grazing for many years, high rodent populations, roving deer and heavy mustard cover in relatively undisturbed spots all combined to limit seedling success. The site chosen for planting was a wide flat area on the east side of the creek bed. The mature oaks here are widely scattered.\n\nThe first planting of 160 seedlings occurred in March of 1985, on part of the land acquired in 1982. There was a fairly heavy herbaceous cover due to the absence of grazing for more than 2 years. It was therefore necessary to scalp each planting location to reduce competition. The trees were placed 50 feet or more from each other and from any existing tree.\n\nTo keep costs down, and to ensure good stock, the trees were grown in TreePeople's nursery from acorns gathered in Cheseboro Canyon in the fall of 1984. Damaged, hollow or insect infested seeds were rejected, through inspection and the \"float test\"--throwing them in a bucket to see if they float. Sound seed was germinated in November by layering in newspaper and/or sphagnum moss, and then planted in quart milk cartons or deep halfgallon pots. Percentage of successful germination for this group was not calculated. We did find that even though the trees spent only 3 or 4 months in the container, the tap root rapidly outgrew whatever space was available. This did not appear to reduce the first year survival, but may have reduced the amount of new growth.\n\nTo reduce mortality due to animal damage, each tree was planted in a protective cage. Below the soil surface, a 1/2 inch aviary mesh was used. The wire was formed into a pocket and the tree planted within it. We estimate that this wire will protect the roots from gophers for 2 to 3 years before rusting out. Apparently, galvanization would probably not extend this period much beyond that 3 year figure. Over the planted tree, a 1 inch poultry wire (chicken wire) was used to protect from browsers. This added a cost of slightly more than one dollar per tree, but the effort was successful. While many trees were damaged by browsing, mostly due to wandering cattle pushing over the screens, apparently none were lost over the first season. The upper cages were pinned into the soil using heavy gauge wire formed into a long u-shaped pin. While this worked, a more effective way probably would have been to use rebar. This would have added significantly to the cost.\n\nA second group of 195 trees was planted in March 1986. These were from acorns gathered in the fall of 1985. The procedures used for germination ware the same. Germination varied from 60 to 90 plus percent for four groups of acorns from as many sites. These trees were planted in the part of the Cheseboro property acquired in 1985, so cattle had only been off the site for a year. Weed cover was heavier than the other site, probably due to a very wet spring. The planting method used was the same, except that the upper cage was modified somewhat so that the edge could be buried an inch or so below ground surface or held down with rocks. Since cattle were less of a problem in the area than before, this method has sufficed. The value of caging the trees was proven when the National Park Service decided to plant the remainder of the oaks from their nursery without any protection. Within 2 weeks all but a handful of trees had been clipped off, and many of the acorns had been dug out by rodents.\n\nIn order to improve chances for survival, the trees were watered when planted and supplemental water has been provided during the driest summer months. While some concern has been voiced over the effect this procedure might have on the drought tolerance and therefore upon the ultimate survival of these trees, it must be remembered that these plantings are primarily demonstrative in nature. In a planting of larger size, where the aim is simply regeneration of an oak stand, supplemental water would most likely be out of the question. TreePeople was able to expend such an effort due to the small planting size and through the use of volunteer labor. Additionally, both planting sites were weeded by the California Conservation Corps during the summer of 1986. All vegetation was cleared in a 3 to 4 foot circle around each tree.\n\nCalculating survival rates has been difficult, as the National Park Service planted trees from their nursery in the 1985 plantation to replace mortality. Survival has been fairly good, however. Even with an extremely hot, dry late summer 1986, roughly 70 percent or more of the trees planted in 1985 were alive in December, 1986. The trees planted in 1986 suffered worse from the dry weather. Many trees that were alive in late summer had died by December. Their root systems were not as developed as those from 1985, and they were not able to survive the lack of any real rain during the 8 months prior to December 1986. Survival for the 1986 group has been about 50-60 percent.\n\nOverall, lack of moisture has been the primary cause of mortality. The ability of a tree to get its roots down to where year round water was available seemed to be a bigger factor than competing herbaceous vegetation. Damage due to browsing animals was fairly high, but seemed to not be a major cause of mortality. Many of the surviving trees have multiple stems, the result of browsing. The tallest trees in both plantings are about 2.5 feet high.\n\nThe plantings in Cheseboro Canyon appear to be a success, not only from the standpoint of having ensured a new generation of Valley Oaks in the canyon, but in that all the labor was voluntary. All the tasks involved, from gathering the acorns, to potting the germinated seeds, to planting the trees, were done by TreePeople volunteers. These plantings created a new awareness and concern for the Valley Oak resource that can only help the efforts of National Park's managers, and increase understanding of the problem among the public. As a follow-up to these plantings, TreePeople and the NPS sponsored two walks in the canyon which focused on oaks as well.\n\nTreePeople has shown that involving the public in issues related to urban forest management, in this case the issue of oak management and regeneration, has major advantages to the resource manager. The public becomes better informed, and they begin to view the resource in a different light. A better informed public becomes an asset to the manager, rather than a hindrance. This can be in the manner of support for increased budgets, or as in TreePeople's case, a volunteer force that can assist in achieving projects stymied by lack of funds or other restrictions on the resource manager.\n\nHerbert A. Spitzer 2 Native vegetation has often been indiscriminately removed by development. In California, many cities and counties have found that the only way to curb the often senseless removal of native plants is to enact tree or vegetation ordinances. These ordinances cover such topics as proper construction and maintenance practices, replacement requirements and often set conditions for plant removal.\n\nIn the late 1970's, people living in the rural portions of Los Angeles County formed local coalitions to save native oak trees. Through their efforts, oak tree consultants and County personnel, an Oak Tree Ordinance was established in 1982. Its purpose was to recognize oak trees on unincorporated land as significant historical, aesthetic and ecological resources and to create favorable conditions for the preservation and propagation of this plant heritage (Los Angeles County Code, 1982).\n\nThe ordinance requires that any person wanting to remove, destroy, relocate or otherwise damage a tree of the oak genus, being eight inches in diameter or more as measured four and one half feet above natural grade, must first obtain an Oak Tree Permit. The application for a permit includes not only ownership information, but also an Oak Tree Report.\n\nThe Oak Tree report forms the basis for determining whether a permit will be issued by the Department of Regional Planning. It includes detailed information on the condition, location, species and size of each tree. The proposed development is evaluated for its potential impact upon each tree shown on the site plan. Also, a map of the subject property, drawn to scale showing each oak tree, is submitted in the report. Each tree must be identified by number on the map and in the field by a permanent identification tag. Additional comments such as crown diameter, lean and other factors are often presented, although they are not required.\n\nThe Department of Forester and Fire Warden reviews the Oak Tree Report for accuracy and reports their findings to the Department of Regional Planning. They often suggest alternatives to the planned development when such alternatives are not cost prohibitive and a reasonable and an efficient use of the land. All Oak Tree Permits are either approved or denied by the Director of Regional Planning.\n\nSection, Department of Forester; Fire Warden, County of Los Angeles.\n\n. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: For decades, California has been using zoning, ordinances, a n d forest p ractice law to control the remo val of hardwood tree species. In 1982, Los Angeles County established an Oak Tree Ordinance to control native oak tree removal in all the unincorporated portions of the County. This ordinance is currently being revised. A more comprehensive ordinance based on tree value is being promoted.\n\nThe portion of the ordinance requiring removed trees to be replaced is ineffective. Replacement trees are being planted, but not maintained for a sufficient period of time to insure their survival.\n\nAdditionally, replacement trees are required to be either 5 or 15-gallon in size. They are, therefore, less than eight inches in diameter and not covered by the ordinance. Some developers have removed these small trees as additional areas have been developed.\n\nDevelopers must replace removed trees on a 2 for 1 or 6 for 1 basis depending upon the replacement tree size regardless of the removed trees condition. A small tree that is in poor health is given the same status as a tree that may have been hundreds of years old, very large, in excellent condition and of exceptional value to the community.\n\nTo bring about a desirable change in the ordinance, it was felt that a basic philosophy change was needed.\n\nBeginning in February of 1986, the Planning and Advisory Committee (PAC) for the Santa Clarita Valley was presented with an alternative to the existing ordinance by the County Forester. It was based on a modified version of the International Society of Arboricultures', \"Guide to Establishing the Value of Trees and Shrubs\". This guide provides a framework to create an Oak Tree Resource Recovery Fund. The fund would be included as part of an overall plan that would meet the following goals:\n\n1. Favor retention of high quality oak trees; 2. Encourage developers to remove poor or otherwise hazardous trees of little value and retain the better and larger trees;\n\n3. Provide a source of funds for establishment and preservation of the oak genus when development makes it necessary to remove a tree and replacement on site is impractical;\n\n4. Provide an incentive for good tree maintenance; and, 5. Minimize the need for intensive field verification of the Oak Tree Report filed by the Oak Tree Permit applicant.\n\nAn additional step would thus be added to the Oak Tree Report. Each tree's value would be determined and become part of the report. This information would then be used to determine whether a financial penalty would be assessed against a developer. This method of appraisal is based on each trees species, size, physical condition and location. It is an unemotional method that will give the tree equal status to man-made improvements. A modified form of this method of appraisal has been successfully used in Cincinnati, Ohio, for street trees (Sandfort & Runch, 1986).\n\n-The basic formula for determining a tree's value is the tree's basic value or the cross sectional area taken at breast height times the current $22 per cross sectional square inch. This is equal to the approximate production cost by nurseries. The resulting figure is then multiplied by the condition, species and location factors which are each reported as a percent of 100 (Neeley, 1979).\n\nThe species factor relates the growing conditions, life span and other elements of a particular plant species to its ideal growing conditions. Although oaks are native to Los Angeles County, especially the Coastal Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia), and Valley Oak (Quercus lobata), little or no reproduction is taking place, air quality is poor in comparison to the past and water tables have fallen. These conditions have resulted in increased stress upon native oak trees and set up the conditions ideal for insects and disease. Due to these changes, site quality has been reduced thus the 80 percent minimum [sic] rating for the species factor.\n\nThe location factor relates the place a plant is growing to the optimum of 100 percent. The highest rating is given for a plant or plants of historical significance while the low end of the scale is applied to wildland plants. The minimum 40 percent figure is a compromise between wildlands and residential growing sites.\n\nAs an example, let us assume that an historical 10-inch diameter native oak in excellent condition is to be removed. Its value would be:\n\nWhere $22 is the cost of growing a tree per square inch, 78.5 is the number of square inches in a 10-inch diameter tree, 100 percent is the trees condition factor, 80 percent is the species factor and 40 percent is the trees location factor.\n\nTable 1-Oak Tree Resource Recovery Fund Worksheet Tables 1-4 show an Oak Tree Resource Recovery Fund Worksheet, variable permit fee, credits for oak trees planted and the Oak Tree Report respectively. Alternative 2; Results in a penalty of $9,692. All Trees would be removed in this case.\n\nAlternative 3; Resulted in no penalty. All the better trees were saved or a total of 4 trees.\n\nAlthough space does not allow for displaying the worksheet of the entire 72-tree report, the results can be shown. The entire property had an oak tree resource valued at $105,457. If the same alternatives were chosen as those used above, the results would be as follows:\n\nFinancial Penalty 1 $12,330 2 $77,925 3 $ 0\n\nThe five desired goals of the County Forester are met. Trees of high quality are favored for retention over poorer quality trees of lesser value. Funds for tree preservation would be provided from financial penalties imposed upon developers who reduced the value of the resource. Tree maintenance was encouraged both prior to development and after a project completed. Replacement trees must survive for a minimum of two years. Since the authenticity of an Oak Tree Report must be verified in the field, the County Forester would now put more emphasis upon the higher value trees.\n\nThe use of tree value alone will not create the conditions favorable for native plant perpetuation. Only when it is reinforced by sound construction and maintenance practices, such as fencing at the drip line to protect feeder roots and providing conditons [sic] that will not set up circumstances that will favor insects and disease (Hunt, 1982), will native species be protected.\n\nThe high values that will be generated by this method may cause a developer to relocate or alter a project when cost benefit analysis and engineering alternatives are considered (Standfort & Runck, 1986). Developers will further consider tree value as a component of total land value.\n\nIn June, 1986, PAC unanimously passed a recommendation that favored the basic philosophy change presented in this paper. As of the writing of this paper, the ordinance study committee and the County Planning Commission are reviewing PAC's recommendation. From a historical need to perpetuate the species and an aesthetic need to maintain natural surroundings, this management alternative proposes the best solution between the development minded public and preservationists.\n\nTree Hazard Assessment Program in San Francisco 1 Stephen G. Smith 2 Like it or not, San Francisco is in the hardwood business. As a matter of fact, 31 percent of San Francisco's urban forest is blue gum eucalyptus (McBride 1978). In December 1982, a terrible windstorm blasted down hundreds of eucalypts in one park and killed a gardener. Sigmund Stern Grove became a log deck and 12,000 cu ft of hardwoods were put up for the City's first major log sale.\n\nIn response to this catastrophe our fledging Tree Assessment Program became permanent within the Urban Forestry Division of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. The department has 3,000 acres of parkland, over 300,000 trees, an annual budget of $50 million and 1,200 employees. The Urban Forestry Division provides system-wide forest services including reforestation, tree pruning and removals, erosion control, insect and disease detection, and habitat enhancement for wildlife.\n\nThe Urban Forestry Division is divided into three sections: (1) The Reforestation Section is responsible for the continual replacement of San Francisco's aging forest; (2) the Arboricultural Section is responsible for all tree pruning and removals; and (3) the Tree Assessment Section collects information to assist both divisions. Golden Gate Park is not monitored or assessed using the individual tree method employed in the other 200 neighborhood parks, squares and golf courses. Golden Gate Park's interior forest is managed on an age rotation (Smith 1980). This forest replacement program methodically removes all old trees over a specific time period and\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California. 2 Park Forester, McLaren Lodge, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA 94117. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987. Abstract: In 1982, San Francisco instituted a Tree Assessment Program for the systematic evaluation of the trees in various parks throughout the City. Many of the City's trees were reaching maturity, and their hazard potential had to be determined. The assessor maps the park and gathers 85 pieces of information on each tree that is assessed. A computer generates reports on the age and vigor of the park, as well as a listing of trees in order of their hazard potential. Trees with high hazard control numbers are transferred to the Municipal Arborist for immediate hazard reduction work. Over time, trends can be analyzed regarding the individual park's health, the maintenance requirements of individual tree species, and the need for additional staff for reducing tree hazards or implementing reforestation procedures. The documented tree work and a detailed historical file will be of significant value in reducing litigation costs.\n\nreplants. This method of forest replacement keeps the forest healthy and safe but is not practical in a small park with relatively few trees of great esthetic value.\n\nThe Hazard Assessment was specifically designed for the Arboricultural Section to use in areas outside Golden Gate Park. Since the late 1970's we were experiencing increasing tree and limb failures in these high use areas. San Francisco's urban (planted) forests are the oldest on the west coast and we, as foresters, must expect failures to increase as trees age. Although all standing trees represent some degree of hazard, some failures are predictable and it is our foremost responsibility to provide a reasonably safe environment for the public and our employees. We also have a legal responsibility; having a professional and systematic assessment process in place can protect the City from claims of negligence. A secondary benefit is that the Assessment system allows us to quantify arboricultural needs and provides us with a mechanism to rationally allocate the arboricultural staff's time. This same mechanism helps us to develop adequate budgets.\n\nThe continuous inventory and physiological condition data collected by the assessors is valuable to the Reforestation Section. From the data, they can identify decadent stands and plan for and provide replacement trees before the planted park forests slowly disappear.\n\nOur assessment of a park unit provides us with a site-and tree-specific map. We also gather forest data such as numbers of trees, tree species, forest health, specific hazards and a tree hazard rating. With these in hand, the rest of the Forestry Division, the Park Division (Maintenance, Claims and Planning) and the Fiscal Division can allocate resources to address the park unit's forestry and land use problems.\n\nWith over 200 parks covering 3,000 acres, the first step was a simple prioritization of the Parks (or unit) by degree of potential hazard to users. A numerical rating system was developed using three categories: Each category has an assigned value between 1 and 3, and all three categories are added up for the unit's priority rating, and e.g., a high priority would be 9, a very low priority would be 3.\n\nof large trees 0-10 = 1 point 10-50 = 2 points Over 50 = 3 points Degree of use Low = 1 point Med. = 2 points High = 3 points Overall tree condition Good = 1 point Fair = 2 points Poor = 3 points\n\nEvery park must have a map, and every tree is accurately placed and numbered. Although this is time consuming, subsequent tree work and forest and park planning are efficiently done with this map making investment.\n\nThe actual inventory and assessment phase evaluates each tree over 6 inches in diameter and 20 feet in height. Each tree is marked with a numbered aluminum tag.\n\nApproximately 85 physiological and structural characteristics are examined to determine the hazard potential of each tree.\n\nThe scientific basis for our final hazard determination for a tree comes from research performed at the Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station of the forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Berkeley, California (Paine 1971(Paine , 1978)). The guiding philosophy was the assumption that all trees in the vertical position are potentially hazardous. All the physical and structural attributes of the tree distill down to a hazard rating formula made of four components: ( 1 P(f), Probability of Failure, is the estimate of the trained assessor that the tree or its parts will fail during a predetermined time period. The City's formal reassessment period is 5 years. The assessor estimates the percent chance of failure after examining and noting specific attributes of the tree, the soil, the environment and modi fied by the assessor's experience with the species. P(s), Probability of striking a target, if a failure occurs, is the most important aspect to any tree hazard assessment program. There must be a target to qualify a tree as a hazard, i.e., if a tree falls in the middle of the forest -no one cares; but if it falls on your home, you have problems. The probability of strike is the evaluation of probable targets that lay in the path of a potential failure. This is expressed as a percentage. Our parks are used, in many cases, 24 hours a day. The potential to strike a \"recreationist\" is sometimes difficult to determine. P(d), damage potential, is based on actual scientific data (Paine 1978). Damage potential is a function of tree form and size. Paine documented over 20,000 actual tree failures and created (Pd) tables based on tree species, diameter and the portion of the tree where the probable failure is expected to occur (roots, lower bole, upper bole, or branches). The University of California (Davis, CA) and the Cooperative Extension Service are collecting data on actual failures and can update these tables.\n\nT.V., Target Value is the value of what would be hit if the tree failed. Our value of a recreationist (person) is $10,000, based on insurance industry payouts nationwide. The current value of a particular type of structure has been determined by our Park Structural Maintenance Division, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company or the Municipal Transit Authority, where applicable. These four values are multiplied together to project a hazard rating: P(f) x P(s) x P(d) x T.V. = $ Value or Hazard Control Number (HCN)The level of hazard at which we have the resources to take control action, with our existing arboricultural staff and equipment, is a HCN of 200 or higher. If we had more resources, we might be able to lower that HCN to 100. If our budget was cut severely, the HCN might have to be raised to perhaps 500 or more.\n\nOur data sheet labeled \"Tree Inventory Data Sheet\" (fig. 1) is filled out on each assessed tree. The form is in three sections. At the top the tree is identified and located, the crew is identified and the map used is noted.\n\nImmediately below the identification data is the \"Condition Class.\" Here is where we collect physiological data to determine the vigor of a tree. This can be important for us on an individual tree basis or for determining the overall health of a particular forest stand or a species in a stand ( or park). This information is important to the Reforestation Section in determining future needs for replacement trees for a particular park.\n\nThe bottom half of the form and the majority of the information gathered is labeled \"Tree Characteristics.\" This looks at the tree purely as a structural organism. There are various kinds of physically observable defects that can be noted. Each defect has a standardized method of measurement and rating determination listed in the \"Glossary\" (training manual) of the \"Tree Identification Data Sheet.\" There are four areas of each tree that are examined for structural defects: roots, lower bole, upper bole and branches. After compiling all observable defects of each area, the assessor determines P(f) and P(s), and then a hazard rating.\n\nPotential root hazards are particularly important because if roots fail, the whole tree fails. The roots have several important functions: they anchor the tree in the soil, they absorb water and mineral elements from the soil, and they store food in the form of starch. Root defects can adversely affect these functions by weakening the vigor and stability of a tree. We often use vigor and evidence of past stability to evaluate the potential for root failure (since the roots are not visible)! We also include the root crown (2 inches above the soil level) as part of the observable root system. We may even excavate around the roots to carefully evaluate potential rot or loss on a valuable tree.\n\nAn example of a potential root defect is a leaning tree. It's possible for a tree to grow in that position, and if so, it could be quite stable. In most cases, a leaning tree has a suspected root problem and one showing more than one movement is highly suspect. With many of the observable defects, using a scale of 1-5 allows the examiner to weigh the defects from highly improbable to imminent potential to fail.\n\nAfter the root section is completed, the overall potential for the roots to fail is estimated by the assessor and (Ps), P(d) and T.V. are determined.\n\nThe Bole of the tree is defined as the stem or trunk of the tree. The bole may extend to the top of the tree, as with conifers (which display an excurrent growth habit) or it may be lost in the ramification of the crown, as in hardwoods (which display a deliquescent growth habit).\n\nLower bole is defined as the lower 20 feet of the tree beginning at the root crown. The lower 6 feet is also called the butt. Its function is to support the entire tree and is important in tree evaluation.\n\nUpper bole is defined as the main stem of the tree from the top of the lower bole to the live crown. The function of the upper bole is to support the main laterals. In deliquescent trees, especially smaller ones, there may not be an upper bole.\n\nBranches are where most failures occur. A limb fails when a combination of forces exceed the strength of the limb at its weakest point. Those forces include weight of the limb, weight of rain, wind, decay, insects, splits/cracks, branch development and spacing. Other factors to consider are angles of attachment, any atypical development, and the diameter of the limb in relation to trunk diameter.\n\nInsects and Disease determination and problem severity help the Reforestation Section determine the appropriate species to replant. Control Recommended is the bottom line of the hazard reduction program. The assessor's determination of type of pruning or removal is crosschecked by the arborist supervisor before work is scheduled. Most trees under the HCN of 200 will not be worked on in the first 5-year interval.\n\nAll the Tree Inventory Data Sheets for a park are entered into a computer, which produces several kinds of reports: Age distribution reports can project necessary replacement time.\n\nVigor reports can pinpoint declining areas or species and spot possible disease infestation sites. Species distribution reports tell us which species are performing well or poorly, and where they are located.\n\nA report listing trees by descending hazard control numbers (HCN) for a particular park or for the entire city.\n\nA report on the pruning history of a tree/ trees in a park or for the city for a year.\n\nThe report on the condition of a particular tree species in certain parks is used by the Reforestation Section to determine future park planting needs or to determine the biological life span of a favorite species.\n\nThe municipal arborist uses the HCN report to prioritize' other job requirements and allocates work crews to the highest hazard areas. Equipment and personnel budgets are justified by specific tree numbers.\n\nThe San Francisco Zoo is having many of its trees removed due to hazard. It also has many trees in poor health. With reports in hand and the obvious need of the trees for a windbreak, funding for a zoo reforestation program is easily justified.\n\nOther reports can be developed to address the use of hardwoods in the urban areas. Hardwoods make up one-third of our park forests and nearly 80 percent of our street and parkway landscapes. Easily made reports from our data base could tell: Which hardwood, city-wide, would be most desirable to plant based on health or hazard.\n\nWhich hardwood has the highest potential to fail; by parts, compared with other tree species.\n\nWhich hardwood would grow in a particular foggy San Francisco park under an existing eucalyptus stand, on an irrigated soil.\n\nProgramming for these reports is \"almost\" available. This information has a high priority in our system because of the potential liability represented by trees, hardwoods in particular, and their potential loss in the park environment if we don't replace them. Training park horticultural staff to program computers takes time and high motivation on the part of the trainees.\n\nTo sum up the process briefly, a Park unit is assessed, each tree is mapped, evaluated and marked with an aluminum tag, the data is entered into the computer and reports produced, work is completed and reentered into the computer. Every year a nontechnical reassessment takes place. Every 5 years a complete reassessment and inventory is undertaken. Tree failures and predicted potential failures are evaluated and the P(d) table is updated.\n\nEvery tree is potentially hazardous unless removed. As professionals we need to make responsible decisions and perform proper control work to enhance our environment with the beauty of trees, yet keep it reasonably safe.\n\nOver the last decade, the hardwood rangelands of California have become subject to increasing pressure to provide housing in rural areas. With many of the prime agricultural and commercial forest sites in the state falling into protective zoning ordinances such as the Williamson Act and Timber Production Zone, counties with rapid population increases have in many cases concentrated new subdivisions in the hardwood range areas. Often, these subdivisions have resulted in varying degrees of tree removal, ranging from complete to selective. Prior to actually subdividing, the landowner may be driven by a number of economic factors to harvest trees on their hardwood rangelands. Economic factors include the increasing demand for oak firewood for home heating and for other biomass products, as well as tree removal to increase forage production for livestock production. Additional harvesting of the tree cover on these lands is often carried out as a part of the construction of residences and supporting road systems once the land has been subdivided.

Photographs were taken of blue oak stands with 0, 40, 100, 200, 300, and 460 trees per acre, and a hypothetical property description was prepared. Thirty rural realtors/ appraisers were interviewed in Ukiah and Santa Rosa and asked for their estimate of unimproved property values. Bare land values in Ukiah were $5100 per acre, and $24,000 in Santa Rosa. Areas with 40 trees per acre were worth $6500 per acre in Ukiah (a 27 percent increase over bare land), and $29,000 per acre in Santa Rosa (a 21 percent increase over bare land). There was little change in property value between 40 and 460 trees per acre in Ukiah, and a trend of a slight decrease in property value in Santa Rosa as tree density increased. Ranchers who may subdivide their hardwood rangeland should maintain some tree cover. In high density blue oak stands, thinning to 40 trees per acre will not decrease, and may possibly increase property value. in a recent report have identified large-scale subdivision as a primary reason for a loss in hardwoods rangelands in the state.\n\nWidescale hardwood removal due to subdivision is of concern in the state for a variety of reasons. There is some evidence to suggest that certain species, especially those in the white oak group, are not adequately regenerating, and any removal creates concern about conservation of the species (Muick and Bartoleme [sic], 1986). Trees on the hardwood rangeland areas in the state also have an important aesthetic appeal to the state's residents. Another important amenity value provided by hardwood trees, is food and cover for wildlife species. Hardwoods also provide visual screening, privacy, and protection from the wind for people who establish residences in these rural subdivisions. It is not clear, however, whether these aesthetic and amenity values of trees on these hardwood rangelands are reflected in the market value of subdivided land.\n\nPrevious studies have determined that individual trees and stands of trees can increase the market value of a property. Literature on the valuation of individual trees on urban and suburban property includes work by Neely (1979) and Chadwick (1980). A study in Colorado found that trees and groups of trees in Estes Park, Colorado influence property value and that property value was maximized at 120 to 140 healthy trees per acre (Walsh et al, 1981). This study also found that property value at 275 trees per acre was approximately equal to property value for 10 trees per acre if all other site conditions were held equal. Payne (1973) showed photographs of wooded and open land in Amherst, Massachusetts to real estate appraisers and found that trees increased the appraised value of unimproved land in a suburban setting by 27 percent. For half-acre lots with houses, maximum property values were obtained with a tree density of 30 trees per acre. In a later study, Payne and Strom (1975) photographed simulated landscapes of different tree density and spatial arrangements. With a property description and map of an actual site, appraisers in Massachusetts and New Jersey were asked to estimate the market value of lots which were identical in all ways except tree arrangement and density. They found that the presence of trees did increase property value, and that scattered trees were preferred to more concentrated arrangements.\n\nAlthough it is widely believed that trees on hardwood rangelands, predominantly oaks, follow the same trend observed in these studies and add to the market value of a property, little empirical data has been obtained to support this assertion in California. The objective of this study was to determine the market value which the aesthetic and amenity values of trees on hardwood rangelands contribute to the value of unimproved rural property. This information would help landowners to assess the value of residual hardwood trees in areas where subdivision will be occurring, and assist them in making decisions about tree harvesting.\n\nAs a preliminary step in assessing [sic] the value of trees on hardwood rangelands undergoing subdivision, this study was confined to blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook and Arn.) woodlands. These areas represent the largest acreage in the hardwood range region in the state. Furthermore, the study was restricted to the Sonoma and Mendocino county region of the state, to minimize the cost of data collection.\n\nIn July of 1986, a series of photographs was taken of several blue oak stands at the Briones Regional Park in Contra Costa County. The areas were photographed to make the trees, grass and slope appear consistent in all photographs. Vistas, steep draws, streams and large-crowned \"trophy trees\" were intentionally avoided. Tree density as the only variation between the five photographs, and included of blue oak stands with 0, 40, 200, 300 and 460 trees per acre. Complete stand data was collected for each photographed area, including the number of trees per acre, percent crown cover, volume per acre, and basal area per acre and is presented in Table 1. A sixth photograph of similar appearance where the blue oak stand had been thinned to approximately 100 trees per acre was added from the collection of Pamela Muick, Department of Forestry and Resource Management at U.C. Berkeley.\n\nA single hypothetical property description was prepared to accompany the six photographs to give unifying assumptions on parcel size, the availability of water and utilities, soils, topography, zoning, access, and several other In order to ascertain the value of the hypothetical rural subvision [sic] properties, 15 individuals including both realtors and appraisers were interviewed in Ukiah and another 15 in Santa Rosa. The selection of interviewees was made in two ways. In the smaller rural area of Ukiah, a list of 30 real estate agents and appraisers was found in the classified section of the telephone directory. The Mendocino Board of Realtors was consulted and indicated that all real estate agents and appraisers listed worked with rural properties. A random selection of 15 was drawn from this population. In the more heavily populated Santa Rosa area, there were approximately 260 realtors and appraisers in the telephone directory. The chair of the Sonoma County Board of Realtors Farm and Land Committee was consulted to determine those realtors specializing in rural acreage sales. A random selection of 15 interviewees was made from this abbreviated list.\n\nEach realtor was interviewed in-person in their office, and were given a brief explanation of the study and its objectives. The interviewees were told to treat each photograph they were shown as a separate piece of property, and to apply the same property description to each area. In this manner, all conditions were presented as the same for each photographed stand with the exception of density of tree cover. They were then handed 8 inch by 10 inch glossy color photographs in a random order. All photographs could be inspected before they were asked to estimate the market value for the entire property. The term \"market value\" as used in this study refers to the \"highest price in terms of money which a property will bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus\" (Boyce, 1975).\n\nMean property values were calculated for each stand and expressed on a per acre value for both Ukiah and Santa Rosa. Outlying observations were deleted if they were greater or less than four times the standard error from the mean value for the stand. Tables 3 and 4 below shows the mean market value of the six different stand structures shown in the photographs for Ukiah and Santa Rosa respectively. Figures 1 and 2 show these results graphically. The mean values are bracketed by plus and minus one standard error (SE) of the mean. Bare rangeland value was worth $5100 per acre in Ukiah, and $24,000 per acre in Santa Rosa for an unimproved subdivision lot. In contrast, stands with as few as 40 trees per acre, were worth $6500 per acre in Ukiah, a 27 percent increase over bare land value, and $29,000 per acre in Santa Rosa, a 21 percent increase over bare land value. These property values were significantly different from the bare land value at the 5 percent level.\n\nReferring back to Table 1, and assuming that there are 85 cubic feet of firewood in a cord, then the stand with 40 trees per acre has almost 27 cords of firewood in it. If a landowner who saw an opportunity for subdivision were to clear the blue oak trees prior to selling the subdivision acreage, then they would be giving up $1400 per acre in the more rural Ukiah area, and $5000 per acre in the more densely populated Santa Rosa area. This means that the sale of firewood would have to generate a stumpage value (standing tree value net of harvesting, processing and transportation costs) of $52 per cord in Ukiah, and $185 per cord in Santa Rosa. Both of these are well above the reported statewide average stumpage value for hardwood firewood of $15 per cord (State Board of Equalization, 1986). Thus, it appears that the market value for the amenities associated with the blue oak trees on hardwood rangelands exceeds the value which can realistically be obtained for firewood stumpage at this time.\n\nTable 3 shows that for the more rural Ukiah location, that there was no statistically significant difference in the per acre property value between 40 and 460 trees per acre. Table 4 also shows no significant difference in property value in the Santa Rosa location between 40 and 460 trees per acre. However, a trend of decreasing property value can be seen in the Santa Rosa location as oak density increases from 40 to 460 trees per acre ($29,000 per acre at 40 trees per acre, versus $26,300 per acre at 460 trees per acre). Further study is needed to see if this trend holds up. However, it can be hypothesized that with the smaller parcel size in the more urbanized Santa Rosa setting (3 acres versus 10 acres for the Ukiah sample), dense tree cover actually represents an increased cost to subdivision. On these smaller parcels, there would   actually be less room to place a home on the subdivision acreage and hence, property values would be expected to decrease at high tree densities.\n\nThis study was an initial attempt to quantify the value of oaks on hardwood rangelands where rural subdivision will be occurring. The results suggest that landowners who are interested in receiving the maximum value for parcels they sell, should not clear all the oaks prior to subdivision. The aesthetic and amenity values from 40 blue oak stems per acre contributed a 21 to 27 percent increase in land value when compared to acreage with no trees present. The lack of a statistical difference in property value between 40 and 460 stems per acre suggests that a landowner could very likely selectively thin their stand and not decrease, and possibly increase property value for subdivision.\n\nThis study needs to be expanded to include other areas of the state where subdivision pressure in hardwood rangelands poses serious concerns about loss of hardwood species. However, these preliminary results do suggest that an understanding of market values for hardwoods by landowners may provide adequate protection of the hardwood cover in the event of subdivision. Maintenance of a hardwood tree cover alone does not ensure that other concerns about subdivision will be alleviated, such as the impact on wildlife species. Nonetheless, attention to spatial arrangement of subdivision lots and minimum lot size by county planning departments working with wildlife biologists, coupled with market driven values for oak stands in rural subdivisions, can help to minimize future concerns.\n\n1\n\nAn * indicates that the percentage of seedlings in the population is significantly greeter than that of control (x 2 . p<.005).\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, San Luis Obispo, CA, November12-14, 1986.\n\nProfessor of Forestry, Department of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, San Luis Obispo, CA, November12-14, 1986.\n\nProfessor of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nAssociate Specialist, Plant Pathology, University of California, Berkeley; Farm Advisor, San Mateo Co., California; Professor, Plant Pathology, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's HardwoodResources,  November 12-14, 1986, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo,  California.\n\nAssociate Professor of Forestry and Professor of Forestry, respectively, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oreg.\n\nThe term \"hardwood\" refers to all woody angiosperms exhibiting either the shrub or tree growth form.\n\nDifferent superscripted letters denote a significant difference among treatments.\n\nGraduatestudent, Department of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley; Staff Researcher Canadian Forest Service, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Staff Researcher, Department of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley.\n\n(Presented at the symposium on \"Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources\" held in California, November 12-14, 1986 at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.\n\nSenior Deputy Forester, Forestry Division, East Management"
