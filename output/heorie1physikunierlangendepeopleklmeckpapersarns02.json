    "abstract": "We introduce Minkowski functionals to characterise, reconstruct and discriminate different complex material microstructures, for instance, experimental data sets generated from X-ray computer tomography imaging; samples include a suite of Fontainebleau sandstone, and a heterogeneous cross-bedded sandstone. Three distinct classes of digitised complex microstructure are considered: particle based Boolean models, structures generated by level-cuts through Gaussian fields, and models based on a Voronoi tesselation of space. One can define a set of measures for random composite media from a single image at any phase fraction φ which allows one to accurately reconstruct the medium for all other phase fractions and to predict, for instance, the percolation threshold pc. The evolution of the Minkowski functions during erosion and dilation operations on non-convex morphologies leads to a very accurate discrimination of morphologybetter than commonly used techniques such as structure functions or chord length distributions.\nSpatial Structures: Experimental Data and Stochastic Models\nThe structure of a disordered material -an oil bearing rock, a piece of paper, or a polymer composite -is a remarkably incoherent concept. Despite this, scientists and engineers are asked to predict the properties of a disordered material based on the \"structure\" of its constituent components. A major shortcoming in the understanding of processes involving complex materials has been an inability to accurately characterize microstructure. The specification of \"structure\" requires topological as well as geometric descriptors to characterize the connectivity and the shape of the spatial configuration. In oil recovery from petroleum reservoir rocks, an area of particular interest to the authors, recovery depends crucially on the topology of the pore space and on the mean curvature of the surfaces where immiscible phases meet at a contact angle. To determine accurate flow models and to devise intelligent recovery strategies requires an accurate characterization of reservoir rocks in terms of topology and geometry.\nTo date, the main toolkit used to quantify complex structures has been primarily that of the statistical physicist and not the advanced techniques developed in spatial statistics\n[11,\n59]\nand digital image analysis [53] presented partially in this volume. For instance, contact distributions are discussed by Hug et al., tensor valuations by Beisbart et al, texture analysis by Soille, and mark correlation functions by Beisbart, Kerscher and Mecke. Complete characterization of the effective morphology however requires knowledge of an infinite set of n-point statistical correlation functions. In practice only",
    "full_text": "lower order morphological information is available; common methods [20] are based on matching the first two moments (volume fraction and two-point correlation function) of the binary phase function to a random model. It is widely recognised that although the two-point correlation function of a reference and a reconstructed system is in good agreement, this does not ensure that the structures of the two systems will match well and attempts to reconstruct materials from experimentally measured two-point information have not been very successful [1,14]. The same problem has been encountered at the atomic scale in characterizing and comparing amorphous atomic glasses, where twopoint correlation functions are recognised to give poor structural signatures. The function is non-unique and does not capture many important features of the microstructure.\n\nOther useful two-point characterizations of microstructure include the chord-length distribution function [47,53] (and the related lineal-path function [60]), the pore size distribution function [51] and other techniques from spatial statistics and image analysis [25,38,53,59]. However, reconstructions of experimental data sets based on these characterisations have been shown to give a poor representation of the connectivity of the systems [26]. Functions that may provide more complete information about connectivity [16] are unfortunately too complex to incorporate into reconstruction schemes [26]. Incorporation of three-and four-point information may lead to a better estimation of structure, but their measurement is very complex and it is not clear how to incorporate the information within reconstruction algorithms. There is a need for morphological mea- sures which include higher-order correlations, but are fast and reliable for characterizing the morphology of a structure.\n\nStatistical measures which are sensitive to the morphology or shape of structures, i.e., to curvatures and connectivity, have been extensively investigated in other fields such as image analysis and pattern recognition [25,38,48,53,59]. Integral geometry [30,32,34,50] provides a suitable family of morphological descriptors, the Minkowski functionals (MFs). These measures embody information from every order of the correlation functions in an integral way, are numerically robust even for small samples, and yield global as well as local morphological information. One of the Minkowski functionals is the Euler characteristic discussed also in the contributions to this volume by Ohser et al and Robins as a topological measure for the connectivity of spatial structures. The Minkowski functionals characterize not only the connectivity, but the shape and content of spatial figures. In three dimensions the functionals are related to the familiar measures of volume fraction, surface area, integral mean curvature and Euler characteristic. These measures are efficiently calculated at the local scale from digital images [29,34]. Minkowski functionals have been used previously to distinguish quantitatively between different complex morphologies; to characterize turbulent and regular Turing patterns from chemical reaction-diffusion systems [31], to show that the hole distribution in thin films is inconsistent with the concept of spinodal decomposition, but consistent with a nucleation scenario [18]. and to discriminate between different cosmological models of the early universe [30]. Measurements of the Minkowski functionals for model random materials has to date been made on only a simple random filling of a cubic network [19].\n\nIn this paper we use the Minkowski functionals to characterise, reconstruct and discriminate different complex material microstructures. We consider three distinct classes of digitised complex microstructure; particle based composites, structures generated by level-cuts through Gaussian fields, and models based on a Voronoi tesselation of space. The models are chosen to represent a wide range of composite structure. Particle models with different grain shapes and mixtures of grains are also employed. We also consider several experimental data sets generated from X-ray-CT imaging; samples include a suite of Fontainebleau sandstone, and a heterogeneous cross-bedded sandstone. We show first how the Minkowski functionals can discriminate different classes of structure (Sect. 2 Characterising via Minkowski functionals). Next a reconstruction scheme for mixtures of overlapping particles is developed. We show that for a Boolean model of any mixture of grains, one can, from a single image of a system at any particle fraction and with no prior knowledge of the ensemble of particle size and shape, define a set of parameters based on Minkowski functionals which allows one to accurately reconstruct the medium for all other phase fractions (Sect. 3 Reconstruction via Minkowski functionals). Third, the Minkowski functionals are extended via the application of erosion and dilation operations. The method is used to sensitively discriminate between different morphologies (Sect. 4 Characterising via Minkowski functionals of parallel surfaces).\n\nThe models we considered in this paper can be loosely separated into three different classes. The first class, particle based models, include Poisson distributed cubes and Poisson distributed overlapping oblate and prolate spheroids. Examples of these Boolean models are given in Fig. 1.\n\nA class of material that is not in general well described by particulate models is that of amorphous composites. Recently model random materials have been described by level cuts of a superposition of random plane waves; the levelled-wave model [7,56]. Originally developed to describe the morphologies associated with spinodal decomposition [10], and later to describe the structure of bicontinuous microemulsions [6], the levelled wave model accounts for many features observed in real disordered materials [7] including polymer blends [21] and foams [46]. Examples of the morphologies generated by level-cuts of Gaussian models are illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nThe third class of morphologies, random cellular solids [15] are constructed using a Voronoi tesselation. In this model we subdivide space randomly into convex polyhedra by scattering Poisson points to a given density and construct the corresponding Voronoi cells, i.e., the bisecting planes between each pair of points. Within each polyhedra every point is closer to the given Poisson point than to any other. The resultant structure is similar to that of a closed-cell foam or random honeycomb. By thickening the walls of the Voronoi cells we obtain a connected system of tubes (starting from edges) or plates (starting from facets), which yields a large range of phase fractions (see similar constructions of stochastic geometries in Refs. [28] and [53]). To do this we generate a Euclidean Distance Map (EDM), a mapping giving the Euclidean distance (1, √ 2, √ 3, 2, ..) of each voxel to its nearest surface voxel. By stepping through the different distances a range of phase fractions for the morphology is generated. To form a foam-like network of low coordination number we considered the trisecting planes of the Poisson points. By using the EDM we grow a network of connected cylinders. At fractions below ca. 10% this may be a good model of foams (see i.e. Figs. 2 & 4 in [35]) and of aerogels [43]. Examples of the Voronoi structures are given in Fig. 3.\n\nIn this paper a number of morphologies derived from experimental images are considered. Direct measurement of a 3D structure is now available via micro X-ray computed microtomography [5,12,54]. These techniques provide the opportunity to experimentally measure the complex morphology of a range of materials in three dimensions at resolutions down to 5 µm and lower. From this technology we obtained data sets for two types of rock; Fontainebleau sandstone and a cross-bedded sandstone. X-ray computed tomographic images of porous media are grey scale images, usually with a bimodal population apparent, one mode corresponding to the signal from the void space, the second to the signal from the grain space. A simple thresholding based on matching a predetermined bulk measurement (phase fraction) is often used to segment a tomographic image. We use a kriging-based thresholding method [37] to give a binary pore-solid image [23,24]. The images are also corrected for noise by re-identifying the phase type of all isolated grain and void voxel clusters. These isolated voxels would otherwise have a strong effect on many morphological measures.\n\nFontainebleau sandstone. The tomographic data of the Fontainebleau sandstone was obtained from four 4.52 mm diameter cylindrical core samples with bulk porosities φ = 7.5%, 13%, 15%, and 22%. In the following the samples are defined by fbφ, i.e. fb13 for the 13% sample of Fontainebleau sandstone. A 2.91 mm length of each core was imaged [12,13,54]. The reconstructed images have a resolution of 5.68 µm resulting in 795 × 795 × 512 imaged sections. Due to limitations in computational hardwareat the time the image was initial processed and segmented [22,23] -the original image was divided into 4 subsamples of size 450 × 450 × 512 by Lindquist, overlapping by 50 pixels on the inner sides. The kriging was carried out on these subsamples, which then were recombined to a single binary image (see Fig. 4). Finally from each of the recombined binarised cylindrical plugs a (centered) 480 3 cubic subset was extracted for analysis corresponding to a volume of 20.3 mm 3 . From each of these final 480 3 samples a central 120 3 subsample is illustrated in Fig. 5. The samples show the variability observed in the Fontainebleau cores. Moreover, the porous fraction of the central 120 3 section of the core fb15 is 19.6%, which does not match the macroscopic porosity (Fig. 5.[c]), and is higher than 19.0% for the central section of the fb22 sample (Fig. 5. [d]). This illustrates a possible strong variability in the porosity observed at a local scale. Figure 6 illustrates the porosity variation per slice along the x,y,z directions of the 480 3 samples as well as the 2-point void-void correlation functions p (2) (r). Each of the slices represents a volume of 0.042 mm 3 . Fontainebleau is considered very homogeneous, and considered a \"benchmark\" of a homogeneous rock in the petroleum industry, but the plot of the porosity variations shows considerable variability on the local grain scale. A statistical summary of average φ and standard deviations is compiled in Table 1. The standard deviation σ(φ slice ) of the data increases with fraction. Defining a normalised deviation as a measure of hetero-Table 1. Volume fractions and variability of the Fontainebleau samples.

A 512 × 512 × 666 image of a cross-bedded sandstone was obtained at 10 µm resolution via micro-CT imaging (raw data from the University of Texas). The image was converted to a binary image in the same way as the other rock samples. Of the cylindrical sample a 300 × 300 × 600 subset was selected, having a bulk porosity of 13.7% and representing a volume of 54 mm 3 . For further analysis this volume was subsampled into 2 disjoint cubes of size 300 3 , 16 disjoint cubes of size 150 3 , 54 disjoint cubes of size 100 3 , and 250 disjoint cubes of size 60 3 . Examples of the subvolumes are shown in Fig. 7. Cross-bedding geologically implies a higher energy depositional environment and therefore stronger heterogeneity of the microstructure. This behaviour is observed in Fig. 8. In particular, strong heterogeneity perpendicular to the primary bedding plane can be seen. The porosity per slice ranges between 5% and 21% for the cross-bedded as compared to the homogeneous Fontainebleau sandstone. The standard deviations of the slice fractions along the cylindrical axis of the core plug are given by σ z (φ slice ) = 0.028, or normalised σ z (φ slice )/ φ slice = 20.4%. A more detailed statistical summary analogous to the Fontainebleau samples, but for two 300 3 subvolumes of the crossbedded sandstone, is given in Table 2. Cleary this sample is the more heterogeneous sandstone.\n\nIntegral geometry [50] provides complimentary methods and tools for measuring spatial structure. These tools are commonly used in other disciplines (e.g, digital image analysis [48]) but have only recently been developed in a systematic way as measures of complex media [3]. A family of measures, the Minkowski functionals in particular seem to be promising measures for describing the morphology of complex materials. The functionals characterise not only the connectivity, but the shape and content of spatial figures such as the configurations shown in Fig. 1. As many physical phenomena depend essentially on the geometry of the spatial structure, integral geometry may provide useful tools to study physical systems. In particular, integral geometry provides powerful formulae for the Boolean model. A review of these measures and applications in physics is given in [3,32,34].\n\nIn this study we consider the integral geometric measures of digitized representations of complex media. We consider a two-component medium filling a cubic volume N = L 3 . A digitised set of either component can be described by a collection of voxels of compact (closed and bounded) convex sets. The global morphology of a Boolean model, i.e., of a structure ∪ i K i made up of individual overlapping grains K of number density ρ are [3,32,34];\n\nwhere φ is the particle phase fraction, S is the surface area to volume ratio, H is the specific integral mean curvature and χ is the specific Euler characteristic (genus). The V i = V i (K) are the measures of the individual grains whereas v i denote the intensities of the measures V i (∪ i K i ), i.e., the mean values of the Minkowski functionals of the union of all grains normalized by the total number of voxels. Note, that these intensities were derived by Miles (1976) for non-discretised configurations, whereas (1) holds for unions of digitised grains K defined as a collection of voxels. In this equation we assume the particulate phase is the continuous phase-each voxel has 26 neighbour connections, while the inverse phase is 6-connected. The dependence of these measures on the definition of the voxel-neighbourhood is discussed in detail in [3] as well as in the contribution by Ohser et al. in this volume. In the examples discussed below, the resolution of the digitisation was always smaller than the size of typical spatial features, so that the differences between neighbourhood definitions can be neglected since they are usually smaller than the symbol size used. It is convenient to normalize the Minkowski functionals for digitised data so that for a single voxel one has V i = 1, in contrast to the normalization W i = ω i V i usually applied for shapes in the Euclidean space with the volume ω i of an i-dimensional unit-sphere. Thus, for cubes of sidelength λ voxels in three dimensions we have\n\nand for rectangular sticks of edge length λ i :\n\n, and V 3 = 1. These powerful formulae given in (1) illustrate that it is sufficient to know the morphology of the individual grains V i = V i (K) and the density of the grains ρ to derive the mean values v i of the global morphology, measured in terms of φ, S, H, and χ(ρ). This result holds also for complex mixtures of grains where V ν is now replaced by proper averaged values of arbitrary shaped grains, for instance, for mixtures of polyhedra as used later. One can replace the quantities V ν of a single grain by averages over an ensemble of n grains, weighted by the probability p j of their occurence\n\n(\n\nwhere p j = ρ j /ρ is the ratio of the densities of the Poisson processes.\n\nCalculation of integral geometric measures. The intensities φ, H, S, χ(ρ) of the global Minkowski functionals can be measured directly from any image made up of discrete voxels. For example, the volume fraction φ of a phase is trivially obtained by dividing the number of voxels of that phase by the total number of voxels. The other functionals are obtained by considering the interface associated with the vertices of each voxel. Global\n\nfor each configuration are obtained by configuration counts over all vertices on any voxelated structure after normalizing by the total number N = L 3 of vertices [3,17,33].\n\nIn [3] the algorithm used to calculate these measures was validated against (1) for a monodisperse grain ensemble. To further validate the algorithm we measure the global morphology φ, S, H, χ for an ensemble made up of mixtures of grains. For each of these mixtures the Minkowski functionals were computed on a minimum lattice size of 200 3 for a minimum of 50 realisations over the full range of the volume fraction φ in steps of ∆φ = 0.02. Figure 9 illustrates the results for a system made up of a mixture of cubes ( 23 ) and sticks (8 × 1 × 1) at equal particle density. We observe excellent agreement between the theoretical and computational results.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Φ -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0\n\nParticle based Boolean models: In Fig. 9 we plot the integral geometric measures for a range of particle-based models. In particular, we compare the sensitivity of the Minkowski functionals to deviations in form or alignment. To do this we consider a Boolean model with overlapping spheroids. We generate randomly oriented and fully aligned overlapping spheroids of uniformly distributed half-axes r = 4, .., 20 and r = 12 and compare to the a Boolean model with overlapping spheres of radius r = 12. As Fig. 9 shows, the Minkowski functionals for all these Boolean models are quite similar. It may be non-trivial to distinguish the measures for these different systems and to estimate the shape of the grains. However, in Sect. 3 we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate V i quite accurately if v i is measured at any porosity φ. Furthermore, in Sect. 4 we propose a novel method to go beyond v i by studying the morphology v i ( ) of the parallel surface of distance which is an even more sensitive technique to estimate the local grain shape V i .\n\nIn particular, by applying erosion-dilation operations, i.e., by studying the morphology of parallel surfaces it is possible to distinguish spatial systems which exhibit similar global morphological measures v i .\n\nThe Gaussian 1-level cut model results in symmetric Minkowski functionals around φ = 0.5 (see Fig. 10(a)). The integral mean curvature is much less than for the particle based models. For small and large φ isolated elongated (elliptical-shaped) inclusions are present and the Euler characteristic is positive. In the regime φ .20 to φ .80 the interface becomes predominantly hyperbolic (χ < 0) and both phases are continuous.\n\nFor the symmetric 2-level cut Gaussians of small φ the surface to volume ratio is much larger than for the previous systems. Particularly at low volume fractions the morphology exhibits a sheetlike phase, and the surface to volume ratio quickly reaches a maximum (Fig. 10(b)). Further densification is associated with a thickening of the sheets and the surface to volume ratio drops. Also for small φ, discretization effects are important and the different neighbourhoods play an important role. The Euler characteristic is very large and becomes negative for small φ, once the sheetlike phase connects, implying a strongly bicontinuous structure, as is evident in Fig. 2.\n\nThe intersection set of the two 2-level cut Gaussians has a distinct signature (Fig. 10(c)) when compared to the 1-and 2-level cut models. The strong Gaussian curvature feature at small φ may be useful as a signature of this structure when compared with the other models.\n\nFor the Voronoi facet model, the connected polyhedra phase always percolates, and the other phase is made up of disconnected inclusions. Accordingly, the curvature never changes sign -the holes remain convex for all φ (Fig. 11(a)). Similarly, the Euler characteristic always remains positive (see [28] for χ of random networks), while the surface area due to the construction of the fields starts at maximum and decreases with thickening facet boundaries. Small ambiguities arise at the intersections of the facets, again giving rise to a separation of the Minkowski functionals based on the choice of continuity.\n\n[a]\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 φ -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 10v 1 , 100v 2 , 1000v 3 v1 v2, 4 neighbors v2, 8 neighbors v3, 6 neighbors v3, 26 neighbors [b] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 φ -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 10v 1 , 10v 2 , 10v 3 v1 v2, 4 neighbors v2, 8 neighbors v3, 6 neighbors v3, 26 neighbors [c] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 φ -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10v 1 , 100v 2 , 100v 3 v1 v2, 4 neighbors v2, 8 neighbors v3, 6 neighbors v3, 26 neighbors [a]\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 φ -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 10v 1 , 500v 2 , 25000v 3 v1 v2, 4 neighbors v2, 8 neighbors v3, 6 neighbors v3, 26 neighbors [b] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 φ -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 10v 1 , 100v 2 , 1000v 3 v1 v2, 4 neighbors v2, 8 neighbors v3, 6 neighbors v3, 26 neighbors For the Voronoi cylinder model, both the network of cylinders and the background phase percolate over a wide range of φ. Here the surface area first grows with increasing cylinder radius, and then decreases again, after the cylinders begin merging (Fig. 11(b)). The curvature decreases with increasing dilation, and becomes negative, once individual edges of the Voronoi cells begin to generate isolated inclusions of the background phase.\n\nThe Euler characteristic is initially negative, implying that both phases percolate, and then increases almost linearly, finally becoming positive.\n\nA number of statistical models have been proposed for reconstructing porous media from statistical information [1,9,20,41,42,44,45]. These methods, based on different underlying model microstructures, are generated in such a manner that they match the observed two-point statistical properties of the rock (see p. 93 in [11]). Of course, one can derive more complex model systems which incorporate other two-point correlation information (e.g., chord distribution functions [47,53]. Recent work [26] has shown that these measures give a poor representation of connectivity. Preliminary results on Minkowski functionals of these more complex models indicate that this is reflected in a poor match to the v 2 measure. In contrast, we compare the morphological measures v i for the sandstone to three standard stochastic models used to generate realisations of sedimentary rock microstructures from two-point information. The first is based on a germ-grain-model with spherical grains [41], the second on the 1-level cut model [1,20], and the third on the intersection set model [45]. The quantities used to characterize the microstructure of these systems are the volume fraction, the surface to volume ratio s/v and p (2) (r), the two-point correlation function. Note that φ = p (2) (0), and\n\nThe correlation function for the phase external to the spheres of radius r 0 in the IOS model is p (2) (r) = p (ν(r)) for r < 2r 0 and p (2) (r) = φ 2 for r > 2r 0 where ν(r) = 1+ 3r 4r0 -r 3 16r 3 0 , and s/v = -3φlnφ/r 0 . To generate matching Gaussian random field (GRF) models we employ the field-field correlation function [44,57]\n\ncharacterized by a correlation length ξ, domain scale d and a cut-off scale r c . The three length scale parameters are obtained by a best fit procedure to minimize the non-linear least squares error [44],\n\nand a downhill simplex method is used to find the best parameter set [36]. We generate the stochastic models that best match the two 300x300x300 samples and compare the normalised 2-point correlation functions S(r) = p2(r)-p 2 p-p 2 of these models in Fig. 12. Estimates of r 0 for the IOS model, and d, ξ and r c are summarised in Table 3 along with the error estimate E(p (2) ). The average fit is worst for the sphere model, and more than a factor two better for the Gaussian 1-level-cut and intersection set. The sphere model however has only one free parameter as compared to three for the Gaussian models.\n\nWe then calculate the integral geometric measures of the three stochastic models and compare with the sandstone data (Fig. 13). The measures are compared to the values resulting from the sampling window at 100 3 . The values for the samples were binned in steps of porosity ∆φ = 0.02.\n\nNone of the models satisfactorily match the experimental data. The surface area (S) is matched best across all φ by the intersection model. Integral mean curvature H is best matched by the IOS models which honours the granular structure of the sedimentary rock. The topology χ is described well by both the IOS and 1-cut models. The intersection model is particularly poor for this model over the full range of φ. The model which best captures the characteristics of the sandstone is the IOS model. Even though the other models do reasonably well at the fraction where the 2-point correlation functions were matched, they fail to describe the structure across a range of phase fractions. Different transport and mechanical processes will depend more strongly on the agreement with specific morphological measures. For example, single phase flow and conductivity will be most strongly affected by surface-to-volume (related to average constriction size) and the topology. A model which accurately describes these two measures may still yield good agreement with experiment. However, multiphase flow properties depend crucially on the curvature of the surfaces where immiscible phases meet. For these processes a model that also accurately matches H will be required. In this case the IOS model is the Table 3. Parameters of the models for the cross-bedded sandstone in microns. The original sandstone data set image has resolution at 10µm per pixel. For the IOS model, the equivalent sphere radius is in the rc column. best of the three candidates as a reconstructed data set. Recently, a model for describing sandstone morphology has been developed based on a full process-based sedimentation, compaction and diagenesis model [40]. This model honours both the shape of the original grains and the geological formation processes and therefore may provide a more accurate description of pore space morphology of sedimentary rock.\n\nIn the previous section we have used knowledge of the local 'grain' morphology to predict global morphology of a Boolean model. Here we consider the inverse process; from a single snapshot of a complex Boolean model derive an equivalent local 'grain' ensemble which will generate for the same complex global morphology. All Boolean models have grains with V 3 = 1. As one can evaluate the four global morphological measures φ, S, H, χ from a single 3D image, one can use (1) to obtain estimates of V 0 , V 1 , V 2 , and density ρ. This technique is called 'method of intensities' (see p. 89 in [11]) and goes back to Santalo (1976). Statisticians consider it as the best estimation method.\n\nWe illustrate this first for Boolean samples made up of monodisperse and polydisperse grains and in Sect. 3.2 for sandstone data.\n\nWe generate realisations of Poisson distributed cubes of different length and spheres of varying radii for a range of phase fractions φ. From any single image we determine the global measures S, H, χ for different values of particulate phase fraction φ and from (1) evaluate the equivalent local grain measures for that image, ρ im and V im i . In Table 4 we give the error in the estimation of ρ im and V im i for a system of cubes of size λ = 8 on a lattice of L = 400 3 . In all cases the densities and the local measures, i.e., the mean values of the grain predicted via (1) vary << 1% from the analytic results. Remarkably, even at high volume fractions where most grains overlap and resolving the local grain ensemble is difficult, the predictions of the local measures are still good. Now the grains also have random shape and we generate a very heterogeneous isotropic mixture of five polyhedra (5-mix): a system made up of sticks (40x1x1), plates (20x20x1), cubes (8x8x8), and two other rectangular prisms (10x5x2) and (16x8x4) in the ratio 10% : 10% : 40% : 20% : 20%. The analytic local measures derived from (2) are given in Table 5 along with the error E i in the estimates via a simulated sample (single snapshot) of the model at L = 500 for three different φ. The error in all the Table 4. Errors in the local grain measures derived from a single snapshot of a complex systems of Poisson distributed cubes and spheres on a lattice of (400 3 ). Analytical values for the local grain measures Vi are given along with the error Ei = |Vi -V im i |/Vi in the prediction of the local grain morphology. V im i are derived via the measurement of the global morphology S, H, χ and use of (1) at three different φ. ρ in the table is the analytic Poisson density from (1) and ρim gives the density derived from analysing the image.

This proves again that the 'method of intensities' is very good and it indicates that one can define an equivalent local 'grain ensemble' from a single 3D snapshot of an arbitrary complex Boolean model. Having accurately estimated the parameters ρ and the equivalent grain ensemble defined by V im i from a given data set, i.e., from a single image at any φ one can use this to reconstruct equivalent complex materials. A difficulty is here that a Boolean model which matches the measured V im i is however not unique. We choose to match the measures with the simplest matching mixture of Boolean particles. For example, one can match the V im i derived from the complex mixture at φ = 0.5 (Table 2) by a Boolean model with a single equivalent grain defined by (λ 1 = 17.047, λ 2 = 6.516, λ 3 = 3.341). We wish to generate equivalent voxelated Boolean models; we therefore define grains with integral λ j . The best match of a Boolean model with a single equivalent voxelated 'grain' to the 5-mix system (λ 1 = 23, λ 2 = 4, λ 3 = 4) gives a poor match to the V im i in Table 6. We therefore determine the best two-grain match to the observed V im i . As shown in Table 6 the fit to the 5-grain model is now very accurate.\n\nHaving defined an equivalent voxelated Boolean grain ensemble, the question remains; does this equivalent system exhibit similar physical properties to the original system for all densities? To investigate this we consider the percolation properties of the original and equivalent Boolean model. We vary the density of the original complex 5-grain system defined in Table 5 and the equivalent Boolean two grain ensemble given in Table 6 and numerically determine the percolation thresholds φ c for both phases of the two models. For the determination of the percolation threshold we use finite size scaling techniques [55]. Results are summarized in Table 6. The error in the predictions of φ c for the equivalent stochastic model is 0.2% for the particulate phase and 1% for the inverse phase. This ability to closely predict φ c of either phase from an image at a single phase fraction underlines the power of a morphological characterisation and reconstruction based on integral geometric measures.\n\nHaving illustrated the ability of the method to reconstruct complicated Boolean models, we now attempt to accurately reconstruct the experimental 3D microtomographic images of sandstone cores. We note that the microstructure of a sandstone is a result of a complex physical process, which can include consolidation, compaction and cementation of an original grain packing. More complex and realistic models of sandstones have been derived [4,40]. These methods require however, the simulation of the generating process including primary grain sedimentation followed by a diagenetic process such as compaction and cementation. This process is both computationally expensive and requires several fitting parameters. Reconstructing the microstructure of sandstones by the simple Boolean model may therefore not lead to the excellent match observed in the previous section. However, a Boolean model with spherical grains has been proposed as a model which gives a reasonable representation of consolidated sandstone and yields good qualitative information on structure/property relationships. Moreover, also other work [2,27,52,58] has shown that the model of overlapping spheres gives a very good match to Fontainebleau sandstone data.\n\nIn the remainder of this section the reconstruction method based on the Boolean model is applied to the cross-bedded and Fontainebleau sandstone samples. Grain ensembles will be determined which match the global morphological Minkowski functionals of the rock images. We compare the goodnes-of-fit of three different Boolean models: overlapping spheres with matching 2-point information, the equivalent Boolean ensemble defined by local morphological measures V i , and a recent model based on the probability density of covering spheres [58]. Differences between the sandstone samples and the reconstructions are discussed.\n\nFontainebleau sandstone. The Fontainebleau data sets were described in Sect. 1.2. Here we derive a number of appropriate Boolean ensembles based on different morphological measures.\n\nIn the first approach the diameters for an overlapping grain model with a deterministic spherical grain are estimated by means of the two-point correlation function introduced in Sect. 2.3 (IOS C model). The sphere sizes are derived for each of the four images of the Fontainebleau sandstone. In the second approach, the diameters are estimated based on the 'method of intensities', i.e., the single sphere can also be determined by using the reconstruction technique (see (1)) based on the local grain measures V ν (IOS (1) model). Note: all model structures based on the reconstruction method outlined in this section carry a numeric index noting the number of different grains used for the reconstruction. The local grain measures of the Fontainebleau sandstone samples are summarised in Table 7, and the best matching IOS (1) models in Table 8. Interestingly, the size of the best matching IOS (1) sphere is significantly smaller than the IOS (C) sphere. As was observed previously for the heterogeneous 5-mix system with a single prismatic grain, a Boolean model with deterministic spheres does not give a good match to the data (Table 8).\n\nTo gain some degrees of freedom, we attempt to fit a single equivalent spheroidal grain (ROS (1) model) to the local V ν , but observe only a slight improvement in the prediction. It is therefore necessary to use more complex models. Our first attempt is a Boolean model with random spherical grains to accurately match the local measures. This is done first for a two-point diameter distribution, i.e., for two different spheres (IOS (2) ). This leads to a better match, but the error in V 2 is still considerable. We then derive the best two-particle match for Boolean spheroids (ROS (2) model). The match to the local V ν of the experimental image is now excellent (Table 8). It is interesting to note that the unique information obtained from the integral geometric measures leads to a quite complex equivalent stochastic model for the Fontainebleau sandstone. The ROS (2) model is composed of two very different particle sizes (Table 8).\n\nAlternative methods to generate a Boolean ensemble exist for model microstructures based on spheres. Very recently Thovert et al. [58] introduced a reconstruction technique for a sandstone based on a model of overlapping spheres where the sphere size distribution is defined by the probability density of the covering radius for spheres (OSC model). This method is employed to generate a third appropriate Boolean model for the four sandstone images. The median of the radius distributions defined in [58] is given in Table 8. This median is comparable to the size of the larger particles in the twoparticle reconstructions but is significantly smaller than either single-particle IOS fits. The original sandstone microstructure for the sample fb15 and various reconstructions via Boolean models are illustrated in Fig. 14. Visual inspection suggests that the ROS (2)  and OSC model more closely resemble the original microtomographic image.\n\nWe now compare the intensities of the global Minkowski functionals for the various models. An analysis of the full 480 3 cubic subsets would only give a single value for the porosity of each of the four samples and would provide little data to compare to stochastic models. However, as shown in Sect. 1.2, the samples are reasonably heterogeneous in the pore volume fraction. Due to this natural heterogeneity and by appropriately choosing different window sizes on the image it is possible to measure morphological parameters for the sandstone images across a range of pore volume fractions φ. This gives us a   (1) , [d] IOS (2) , [e] ROS (2) , and [f] OSC. Visual inspection suggests that the ROS (2) and OSC model more closely resemble the original microtomographic image.\n\nTable 8. Parameters for the Boolean models of the Fontainebleau sandstone and errors of the morphological matches. The first IOS model (IOS C ) was matched using the void-void correlation function. The other models are matched using the reconstruction based on estimating the local grain shape of a Boolean model. IOS is generalised to more than one sphere, all spheroids are randomly oriented (ROS). Note the large errors EV i in the local measures for the 1-particle IOS model. For all two-particle models one of the particles is very small and has a width of the order of a few voxels. a, b, c note the length of the half-axes with the exception of the OSC model, where a notes the median of the radius distribution G(rc) = 1/2.\n\n5 1 71.3 3.4 3.6 2.5 fb13 1 65.8 2.4 2.6 1.8 fb15 1 69.1 3.1 3.4 2.5 fb22 1 59.0 1.6 1.8 1.3 IOS (1) fb7.5 1 45.8 5.3 • 10 -3 .71 .022 fb13 1 44.6 .016 .66 6.8 • 10 -3 fb15 1 47.4 4.1 • 10 -3 .058 .84 fb22 1 43.2 2.5 • 10 -3 .44 .67 IOS (2) fb7.5 .865 16.6 4.8 • 10 -3 6.6 • 10 -4 .022 .135 88.3 fb13 .864 16.6 3.9 • 10 -5 1.8 • 10 -4 6.8 • 10 -3 .136 84.8 fb15 .817 13.3 7.5 • 10 -5 1.1 • 10 -4 .018 .183 83.3 fb22 .798 16.5 2.2 • 10 -5 3.0 • 10 -4 8.7 • 10 -3 .202 72.4 ROS (2) fb7.5 .848 12.5 11.9 8.52 1.5 • 10 -7 7.5 • 10 -6 1.5 • 10 -4 .152 83.5 80.7 77.2 fb13 .863 15.9 11.4 9.09 9.1 • 10 -8 5.4 • 10 -7 3.0 • 10 -5 .137 84.6 76.7 76.1 fb15 .794 15.3 12.5 8.52 1.8 • 10 -7 2.7 • 10 -6 8.9 • 10 -5 .206 84.6 80.1 76.7 fb22 .751 16.5 10.8 8.52 2.1 • 10 -7 2.0 • 10 -6 1.6 • 10 -5 .249 74.4 67.0 63.6 OSC fb7.5 94.8 7.4 5.2 2.4 fb13 86.0 12 8.6 4.1 fb15 85.9 5.3 3.9 2.0 fb22 67.7 3.2 2.4 1.4\n\nmore comprehensive data set with which to compare experimental images to equivalent Boolean models. For the Fontainebleau samples we consider cubic blocks of 480 3 , 240 3 and 120 3 . This provided in all cases a good spread of porosities across different sampling volumes. The measured morphological properties S, H, χ(φ) are summarised in Fig. 15.\n\nWe note with interest that the fourth Fontainebleau data set fb22 exhibits very different measures to the first three sets. This could indicate the potential presence of heterogeneity, as seen in Fig. 5.(c) in Thovert et al. [58]. Another explanation may be that another diagenetic process occured during consolidation of this sample. ROS (2) . For H and χ the measures for the highly connected neighbourhood are given.\n\nAs indicated by the relative error in the local integral geometric measures (Table 8) the ROS (2) model almost exactly matches the local measures of the sandstone samples. The IOS C and OSC model perform poorly, particularly for H, where IOS C overestimates, and OSC underestimates the image data (see Fig. 15). Another measure of the accuracy of the reconstruction is based on a comparison of the variation of the pore volume fraction per slice. This gives one a measure of the heterogeneity of the sample. The two best Boolean models based on the reconstruction by local Minkowski functionals are compared to the common IOS C model and the OSC model in Fig. 16. It is difficult to distinguish which reconstruction gives the best match. The models ROS (2) and IOS C both do well, while the OSC model gives enhanced heterogeneity. An attempt to quantify the differences is given in Table 9 by measuring the variability of the pore volume per slice for the Fontainebleau sandstone and its reconstructions. No firm conclusions can be drawn, as the measures themselves vary too strongly (see the column for the x,y,zvariability of the Fontainebleau data in Table 9. The OSC model is too heterogeneous and gives the worst match, while ROS (2) and IOS C give reasonable agreement.\n\nOSC Fig. 16. Comparison in the variation of the porosity distribution along the z-axis of the Fontainebleau samples and reconstructions. Sample size is the same as in Fig. 6.\n\nCross-bedded sandstone. We adopt a similar procedure to analyse the cross-bedded sandstone data set described in Sect. 1.2. Two cubic blocks of 300 3 , 16 blocks at 150 3 , 54 blocks at 100 3 and 250 blocks at 60 3 were obtained from the full sample volume. This provided a spread of porosities across different sampling volumes. With decreasing sampling volume the variability of the measures increases, but the values are consistent with the data for the larger volumes, suggesting that for the smaller blocks a meaningful Table 9. Variability σz(φ sl ) [%] of the pore volume per slice along the x,y,z-directions of the Fontainebleau samples and the z-directions of its reconstructions (see also average is determined. The global morphological measures of the solid fraction of the sandstone are φ = 0.863, S = 1.82 mm -1 , H = 15.5 mm -2 , and χ = 2.73 mm -3 . An IOS C model microstructure is generated by matching two-point correlation information as described in the previous section. The equivalent local grain measures V ν for the first 300 3 sample of the sandstone are V 0 = 0.00464 mm 3 , V 1 = 0.0340 mm 2 , and H = 0.199 mm. Attempts to fit a single spherical grain to these values are again not successful (Table 10). The best two-particle matches for Boolean spheroids are given in Table 10. The IOS (2) ensemble gives an excellent match to the average volume of the grains, but less so for average surface area and mean curvature. The ROS (2) system leads to an excellent match of all V ν of the experimental image. The equivalent OSC model is also given. Results for the morphological measures are summarised in Table 10 and Fig. 17.\n\nAgain the IOS C model and the OSC model do not give a good match to the local grain measures V ν , leading to a poor match of the global measures. In particular, IOS C overestimates S and H, while OSC underestimates S, H, and χ. ROS (2) closely represents the curved interface of the original structure. This is consistent with a visual comparison of the cross-bedded sandstone to its reconstructions by Boolean models given in Fig. 18.\n\nWe also compare the porosity variation of the original image and its reconstructions. In Fig. 19 the porosity variation along the x-axes of the two 300 3 cross-bedded sandstone samples are compared to the porosity variations of the reconstructions. The reconstructed images based on the two-grain models exhibit heterogeneity which is not observed in the IOS model (see Fig. 19 and Table 11). The OSC model gives a good match to the heterogeneity of the cross-bedded sandstone along this direction. This is different to the Fontainebleau sandstone match discussed previously, where OSC overpredicts heterogeneity; larger heterogeneity may be an inherent feature of the OSC model. None of the isotropic reconstructed images are as heterogeneous as the original rock. This is not surprising. Cross-bedding is a result of a complex geological deposition process in a fluvial environment, where i.e. flow channel geometries change over time, and long-range heterogeneity and correlations result. The Boolean models cannot mimic the complex physical processes which lead to the observed structure of a cross-bedded sandstone.\n\nTable 10. Parameters for the Boolean models of the cross-bedded sandstone. The first IOS model (IOS C ) was matched using the void-void correlation function.

While strong differences were observed between classes of models, in some cases Minkowski functionals were unable to discriminate measures for the same model class (e.g. Boolean models in Fig. 9). In this section we show that a more powerful discriminator of morphology is based on the evolution of the Minkowski functionals during erosion and dilation operations. This methology has been used previously to discriminate between different cosmological models of the early universe [30]. In these cases, the Minkowski functionals of parallel bodies of a point pattern (a convex set) was considered. The point pattern was dilated to obtain detailed morphological information where the parallel distance was used as the diagnostic parameter.\n\nIn the current section we use the evolution of the Minkowski functionals during erosion and dilation operations on complex non-convex morphologies. It is shown that these Minkowski functions (Mfs) gives a discriminating signature of structure. We also consider the morphology of the reconstructions of Fontainebleau sandstone discussed in Sect. 3.2 and use the method to discriminate the best match to the sandstone morphology.\n\nOne may define the parallel body of a structure A as the set of all points x with distances d(A, x) less than to A. Here, d(A, x) = Min (|x -y|; y ∈ A) denotes the minimal Euclidean distance where |x| is the standard norm in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Changing corresponds to dilation > 0 and erosion < 0 of the spatial structure A. For negative values of the parallel body is defined formally by A <0 = {x; d(A c , x) ≤ } c , i.e., as the complement set of all points with distances less than to the complement A c of A. Alternatively, one may define the parallel body\n\nby the union of all spheres B (x) of radius and centers x ∈ A inside of A. For < 0 the parallel body is given by the set of all centers x so that the union A = ∪ x∈A B (x) equals A.\n\nA direct implementation of ( 6) is computationally very inefficient as it requires one to place spheres of different size along all voxels at the interface at each erosion/dilation step. Our algorithm instead utilizes the definition given by ( 5) using an Euclidean Distance Map (EDM). From the EDM the erosion/dilation is trivially implemented by stepping through the different Euclidean distances from the interface.\n\nIn previous work [8] approximations to the EDM have been employed due to the large computational overheads associated with calculating the map. We have developed fast algorithms for calculating the EDM exactly which are similar to one published previously by Saito [49] with extensions to include periodic boundary conditions. The exact EDM for each voxel is calculated by growing (discretised) spheres at each voxel x i until it reaches an interfacial voxel on A and returns the corresponding Euclidean distance d. We define the digital sphere of radius r by all voxels radiating from the central voxel that are separated by a Euclidean distance d < r with the sphere center defined as the center of the voxel. The algorithm speed is dramatically accelerated by noting that the Euclidean distance to A any voxel x j neighboring voxel x i will be given by d(A, x i ) -d(A, x j ) ≤ 1 (in units of the voxel size). One needs not step through all possible radii for each voxel, but instead one can use d(A, x j ) = d(A, x i ) -1 as an initial guess. We increment d(A, x j ) by a minimum of 0.1 at each step and generate the equivalent digitized sphere for that radius with an upper limit of r = 50. This gives up to 400 different radii, for which the integral geometric measures can be evaluated. We compute the measures on a minimum lattice size of 128 3 for a minimum of 50 realizations.\n\nTo illustrate the powerful discrimination of morphology which comes from measuring the Minkowski functions of parallel bodies we follow Roberts [47] and select two model images and generate a range of equivalent model morphologies via matching first and second order statistical properties. This method was used in [47] to illustrate the relatively strong signature provided by the chord-length distribution function(CDF). We illustrate the strong discrimination which is possible when using Minkowski functions for these systems.\n\nIn [47] Gaussian random field (GRF) systems are considered; the single cut model and the symmetric two-cut model (Berk's original model [6]). Other models considered can be formed from any number n of intersection I n and union U n sets of the GRF models. One then considers a specific GRF model with known statistical properties as the \"experimental\" data set. Reconstructions are generated by matching the volume fractions and by minimising the difference in the 2-point correlation functions via (4). The minimisation algorithm defines r c , ξ and d for each model. All the models are able to provide an excellent fit to the data based on matching the two-point information. In [47] the CDF is used to attempt to better discriminate the best matching model morphology. We use the Minkowski functions φ, S, H, χ( ) to measure the best morphological fit to the data.\n\nIn the first case the experimental data set was based on a symmetric two-cut model (N 1 ) at φ = 20% obtained from the auto (field-field) correlation function [47]:\n\nwith ℓ 0 = 2µm. Attempts to match the experimental data set were made for models N 0 , N 1 , U\n\n2 1 , I 2 1 . The resultant values of r c , ξ and d for four different models are given in Table I of [47].  I of [47]. exp corresponds to the \"experimental\" image, and the lines give the best fit to the model morphology.\n\nWe show in Fig. 20 the Minkowski functions for the parallel sets of each model morphology and the original experimental data set. As in the examples discussed previously we consider the morphological measures v ν (φ) as a function of the porosity φ = φ( ) with 0 < φ < 1.\n\nIn Table 12 we quantify the error in the measure of the Minkowski functionals for the different model morphologies by employing a relative least squares error:\n\nSince the porosity values are not identical for all , linear interpolation is used to do the resampling. We also show in Table 12 the errors Eρ 1 and Eρ 2 in the chord distribution function (CDF) measure from [47]. We observe that the Minkowski functions provide a far stronger signature of morphology than the CDF. While the CDF does discriminate between some models, it is impossible to choose between model N 1 and U 1 as the best reconstruction for the two-level cut model. For all four measures of the Minkowski functions the actual model morphology is more than two orders of magnitude more accurate than any other. It is important to note that we could discriminate morphology from one-or two-dimensional information (S and H) as readily as from χ. Therefore the method can be used to discriminate morphology from two-dimensional micrographs of the material or from one dimensional chord length measurements.\n\nIn the second case the experimental image was a 1-level cut model (N 0 ) and attempts to match this data set were made for models N 0 , U 2 0 , I 2 0 . Again the Minkowski functions give a very strong signature of morphology and allow one to discriminate the correct morphology (see Fig. 21 and Table 13).  II of [47].\n\nThe Minkowski functions appear to provide a strong signature of composite morphology and hence may provide a method for selecting an accurate reconstruction of a disordered material. In the next section we attempt to do this for the experimental tomographic images of a termite nest and the Fontainebleau sandstone data sets. Fontainebleau sandstone. In Sect. 3.2 three different reconstructions of a Fontainebleau sample were derived based on estimating the local Minkowski functionals of a Boolean model. One system gave an excellent match to the global Minkowski functionals of the sandstone samples. Here the three different Boolean ensembles (IOS C , ROS (2) , and OSC) and a fourth stochastic model for Fontainebleau sandstone, based on a Gaussian reconstruction given by 5 intersecting 1-level-cut Gaussian models [44], are compared for the accuracy of reconstruction by evaluating the Minkowski functions. The Gaussian kernel used for the intersection reconstruction is given by the Fourier transform pair g(x) and ρ(k) = -F (k)/(4πk) with\n\nwhere ξ = 51.9 µm and d = 272 µm [44]. To preserve the variability of the data and allow a direct comparison to the Fontainebleau sandstone samples, all reconstructions were generated at the same resolution and domain size; the 480 3 (20.3 mm 3 ) Fontainebleau samples are used. The comparison of the Minkowski function data from the tomographic image of Fontainebleau sandstone to the reconstructions is given in Fig. 22. Large jumps are  (2)   [b] observed in the Minkowski function data for some morphologies, particularly near the original image porosity φ 0 . These jumps are due primarily to discretisation effects.\n\nWhile homogeneous, we have resolution limitations leading to discretisation errors in . All images contain features on the scale of a small number of voxels. When one erodes/dilates by a small , the step size is large and the effect on the morphological measures is large. Discretisation errors in therefore happen for all images; less so for features much larger than the voxel size.\n\nThis effect is particularly pronounced for Boolean sphere models. For more irregular particles, the 2-spheroid matches, the peaks become less pronounced. The same applies to the OSC model, where a continuous distribution of sphere sizes is present and this effect is smeared out.\n\nThe integral error of the Minkowski functions ( ( 8)) for the four models is given in Table 14. We note that the Gaussian and ROS (2) models do best while IOS C and OSC perform poorly. It is surprising that despite the large errors in the Minkowski functions of the Boolean reconstructions due to the peaks at φ 0 and φ → 1 the ROS (2) model is still good. Note, however, that the Boolean models were matched individually to the four Fontainebleau sandstone samples. The Gaussian model of reference [44] was matched to a single sample at φ = 15.4% of Fontainebleau sandstone from another study. Thus the reconstruction using the Gaussian scheme does remarkably well. The OSC model, which gives the worst match to the Minkowski functions of the Fontainebleau sandstone sample, performs significantly better for the higher porosity samples. It is also remarkable, that the qualitative behaviour of most curves (e.g. the H curves in Fig. 22) are matched by the different models, even though none of the reconstruction schemes is actually based on parallel surface information.\n\nIn this paper we have used the Minkowski functionals to characterise, reconstruct and discriminate different complex material microstructures. We consider three distinct classes of digitised complex microstructure: particle based composites, structures generated by level-cuts through Gaussian fields, and models based on a Voronoi tesselation of space. The models are chosen to represent a wide range of composite structure. Particle models with different grain shapes and mixtures of grains are also employed. We also consider several experimental data sets generated from X-ray-CT imaging; samples include a suite of Fontainebleau sandstone, and a heterogeneous cross-bedded sandstone. We show first how the Minkowski functionals can discriminate different classes of structure.\n\nWe subsequently show that for the Boolean model of random composite media one can define a set of measures from a single image at any phase fraction φ which allows one to accurately reconstruct the medium for all other phase fractions. The accuracy of the reconstruction is illustrated by accurately predicting the percolation threshold p c for the reconstructed data sets. We have illustrated the method for experimental sandstone images and showed that, in general, the reconstruction based on integral geometric measures of a Boolean model gives a better match to the morphology than the commonly used IOS C and the recently developed OSC model. Moreover, unlike the IOS C and OSC models, the current method is not limited to spherical inclusions, but can be used to generate more complex inclusion shapes.\n\nWe note that the morphological reconstruction of sandstones via Boolean models does not give as accurate a match to the experimental data as we observe when reconstructing a complex Boolean model. Clearly a Boolean process cannot mimic sandstone formation (sedimentation, diagenesis, compaction, etc.). The reconstruction method can be improved: one development that will further highlight the utility of the proposed technique is based on conditioning the equivalent ensemble to better mimic the local morphology of the medium. This could be done by conditioning to local curvature measures or chord-length distribution measurements which will limit the choice of grain \"shape\" to use in the equivalent Boolean ensemble. In oil recovery from petroleum reservoir rocks, an area of particular interest to the authors, recovery depends crucially on the mean curvature of the surfaces where immiscible phases meet at a contact angle. Conditioning an equivalent Boolean ensemble to exhibit the same distribution of local mean curvature should lead to a better prediction of multiphase flow properties on reconstructed images. The current work is based on deriving equivalent local measures from an image for Boolean models; (1). Extension of the methodology to more general systems; hard-sphere mixtures, soft sphere models and models based on Gaussian random fields representing a wider range of complex materials including ceramics, composite materials and fibrous media is now being considered.\n\nIn the final section new measures were derived for the characterisation of the morphology of disordered systems based on the evolution of the Minkowski functions (Mfs) during erosion and dilation operations on non-convex morphologies. The method can be used to discriminate morphology from 1D (chord-length), 2D (micrographs), and 3D (tomographs) data sets. It is shown that the use of parallel sets and Minkowski functions leads to a very accurate discrimination of morphology. The application to experimental data of Fontainebleau sandstone shows that, while the reconstruction models considered work reasonable, none stands out as \"brilliant\" -and more realistic morphologies need to be considered to get a good match as in Sect. 4.2. This is left as future work, where we will consider process based models as developed in [39].\n\nC OSC ROS"
