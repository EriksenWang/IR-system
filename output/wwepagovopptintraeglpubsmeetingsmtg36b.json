This represents a weight-of-evidence approach to select UF values that generate scientifically credible AEGL values. However, weight-of-evidence considerations may not provide the necessary experimental data to quantitatively allocate the uncertainty factor adjustment between inter-and intraspecies uncertainty factors.\n\nThe National Academies (NRCJAEGL Subcommittee) has expressed its concerns on the current weighof-evidence approach used to modify the UFs since it is usually not possible to assign the adjustment between the inter-and intraspecies uncertainty factors based upon the available data. As an alternative approach, the NACJAEGL Committee could select UFs using the criteria stipulated in the SOP which rely on the thorough assessment of experimental data and scientific judment. A weigh-of-evidence assessment is independently conducted following selection of UFs to determine whether or not the AEGL values need to be adjusted with another factor to ensure that the range of AEGL values is consistent with the animal and/or human supporting data. This adjustment could be done with a modifying factor. However, using a modifying factor for such purposes may be inappropriate because the modifying factor is generally used to account for database uncertainties. This adjustment factor could be called the weight-of-evidence factor and be used to revise AEGL derivations based upon a weight-of-evidence evaluation of the supporting data and to make AEGL values consistent with the supporting data.. Its magnitude (>O) will depend on the empirical data specific for the chemical under consideration. Values less than 1 should be expressed as a fraction, such as 113 or 1/10, to be consistent with the UF progression of 1, 3, and 10, and avoid a repeating decimal.\n\nThe rationale for the selection of the weigh-of-evidence factor should include the following: 1. Citations and explanations of the supporting human and/or animal data 2. Justification for the selected factor, including discussion of why the initially derived AEGL values conflict with the published evidence\n\nEndorsed by USEPA (1994,2002,2003) and NAS (1993,1997) Broadly Used in Risk Assessment H IRIS, FIFRA, Office of Water, Air, OPP H Industry OSHA Detailed risk assessments typically use PBPK Improve the extrapolation of internal doses Exposure -Internal Dose -b Response Pharmaco kinet ics PBPK Models I , ) Pharmacodynamics PBPt) Models Use of PBPK Models in AEGL Development I 1.

AEGL-1 limits do not conform with SOP for AEGL (use only sensory irritation as relevant endpoint, acetone is a very weak sensory irritant, AEGL-1 far too conservative) 4. AEGL-1 very close to LOA of 160 ppm, may result in unnecessary alarm or panic in an emergency situation. (balance the need to keep people safe without causing widespread fear and confusion in the affected population) 5. (errors or omissions in Table 8.2 regarding extant standards and guidelines for acetone; will be checked and corrected, but not be dealt further here) John Morawetz Basis for AEGL-1: The \"bottom line is that without any factor, the population variability stated in the SOP is not taken into account.\" (do not use study of Nelson et al. (1943) since its use was rejected recently by NACIAEGL in the derivation of AEGL for another substance (acetaldehyde).\n\nRemaining studies considered to have limitations because of the number of subjects were small, all were male and healthy. Therefore a modifying factor of 2 is recommended and 250 ppm be used as a starting point. This would lead to a (rounded) AEGL-1 of 130 ppm for all time points. Alternatively, John Morawetz also suggests to discuss that a higher concentration (with, however, effects above AEGL-1 threshold) and an intraspecies uncertainty factor of 3 might be used.\n\nNACIAEGL-36: April 2005 Statement to GAMA comments for AEGL-2 and -3 Case reports: show that high blood levels (2500 mg/L) may be survived but these patients received intensive medical care at stationary hospital admittance, outcome otherwise not known sometimes biased by history of disease (chronic alcoholism) and medication uptake of mixtures, acetone not considered cause of death uptake of isopropanol, acetone is active metabolite but role of both hard to differentiate PBPK models: may be useful to describe toxikokinetics at lower concentrations (about 500 ppm), but not validated at high exposure concentrations relevant for AEGL-2 and AEGL-3 use of interspecies uncertainty factor would still be necessary to account for possible kinetic and, especially, toxikodynamic differences Recommendation: Retain derived AEGL-2 and AEGL-3 values for all time points. NACIAEGL-36: April 2005 AEGL-1 GAMA states that AEGL-1 rely on \"sensory irritation\" which is observed for acetone at concentrations far higher than 1,000 ppm Statement to GAMA comments \"airborne concentration . . . above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible individuals, could experience notable discomfort, irritation, or certain asymptomatic nonsensory effects. . . . effects.. . not disabling.. .transient and reversible ....\" Not restricted to \"objective\" sensory irritation as suggested by GAMA, other factors also relevant. NRC (2001), derivation of SMAC (\"Spacecraft Maximum Allowance Concentrations for Selected Airborne Chemicals\"): \"For 1-h and 24-h SMACs, a slight degree of adverse effects is acceptable as long as the effects do not limit an astronaut's ability to perform during an emergency. The slight adverse effects at 200 ppm reported by Stewart et al. (1975) and those at 250 ppm reported by Matsushita et al. (1969a) are acceptable for short-term exposures (24 h), and, on the basis of the 1000-ppm results in the Stewart study, and the 500-ppm results in the Matsushita study, a 1- h exposure at 500 ppm should not affect performance.\" Follow NRC (2001), but consider different protection level and group (trained astronaut's NACIAEGL-36: April 2005 6 I ability vs. general public exposed without warning); AEGL-1 is in accordance with definition and fully consistent with NRC-evaluation in the derivation of SMACs.\n\nGAMA: AEGL-1 of 200 ppm close to LOA of 160 ppm, suggests widespread panic and mass confusion could develop in an emergency situation when people are exposed at or near the AEGL-1 level.\n\nCognitive bias can influence perceived irritation and health symptoms from acetone exposure (more health symptoms in \"negatively biased\" experimental groups) Reaction to Acetone does not depend on the level of the AEGL-1 but on the subjective signs that may be felt at exposure. In an emergency situation, it is to be expected that persons exposed to acetone will react rather more than a \"negatively\" biased group.\n\nTherefore, we consider an AEGL-1 level of 200 ppm as appropriate. NACIAEGL-36;April 2005 without any factor, the population variability stated in the SOP is not taken into account. Use mofifying factor of 2.\n\nStatement to comment of J. Morawetz Concentrations around 200 -500 ppm represent the lowest level of the concentration range above which effects of exposure to acetone are increasingly reported. Although in the studies used all volunteers were males, not much variance is expected in the outcome between males and females with respect to the endpoints considered relevant here. Therefore, we suggest that a modifying factor is not necessary.\n\nRetain derived AEGL-1 values for all time points.\n\nNACIAEGL-36; April 2005 Revisit of Acetone Key studies: Ernstgard et al. 1999; Matsushita et al. 1969a; Nelson e t al. 1943; Stewart et a1.1975 Endpoint: 200 ppm: subjective symptoms (irritation) not reported more often than in controls (Nelson et al., 1943; Stewart et a1.1975); 250 ppm: slight irritation, few complaints about discomfort in one study (Matsushita et al. 1969a) but not in another (Ernstgard et al. 1999) 300 ppm: slight irritation in majority of volunteers (Nelson e t al. 1969); Scaling: one value for all time points since local effect, accommodation, complaints about discomfort not reported to increase during several hours of exposure Total uncertainty factor: 1 Intraspecies: 1 200 pprn a s NOEL for local effects, effects weak at higher conentrations 1 AEGL-1 Values ~ 1 hour Remark: AEGL-1 is above odor recognition threshold.

The rationale provided for this determination is that \"these data suggest little difference between species in response to allyl alcohol exposure\" (page vii, line 28; page 17, lines 25-26). However, no data are provided in the Executive Summary to support this claim. The text (page 17, Section 4.3 Species) discusses some data, but it is not sufficient to conclude that all species (including humans) respond similarly to the effects resulting from exposure to allyl alcohol.\n\nThe data discussed in Section 4.3 are mostly lethality data, and no data on humans were presented that are comparable to the animal data. In addition, the text states that \"the lethality data summarized in Table 5 lack LC,, values suitable for direct comparisons of species sensitivity\" @age 17, lines 19-20). In addition, the data presented on nonlethal effects come fiom a study in which all the animal data were grouped together such that the reader cannot determine which specific effects occurred in which specific species. The text states that these results were \"discussed in general terms for all species\" (page 9, line 33). For these reasons, selecting an interspecies UF of 1 for AEGL-3 may not be justified, and a UF of 3 could be used to derive AEGL-3.\n\nThe argument for selecting an intraspecies UF of 3 for AEGL-3 is weak and not scientifically based; the values would be \"inconsistent with available empirical data\" (page vii, line 33). Inconsistency between the results and other established values is not sufficient reason to alter the UFs. It is illogical to make a scientific judgment about what the UF should be based on the data and available information, and if the end result values seem inconsistent with other values, go back and adjust the UFs. The UFs should remain the same and then, if there is a strong reason to change the resulting numbers, an adjustment should be made. There needs to be a solid scientific basis for moving away fiom the default value of 10. This should not be done in order to \"make the numbers work.\"\n\nAs written, it is not clear why the experimentally derived n = 0.8 in Section 4.4 was not used for time scaling since page 94 of the SOP lists TCE as one example of a substance with n = 0.8. There is nothing in Section 2.7 of the SOP that states empirical n values < 1 .O shall be assumed equal to the default n value of 1 ; SOP page 103 states, \"The lowest value of n was 0.8 and the highest value of n was 3.5.\" Therefore, additional justification for n = 1 (page 20, lines 28-29) is needed unless the empirical n = 0.8 is used in time scaling.\n\nAlly1 alcohol is a colorless liquid that is a potent sensory irritant. Signs of intoxication following inhalation exposure to allyl alcohol vapor include lacrimation, pulmonary edema and congestion, and inflammation, hemorrhage, and degeneration of the liver and kidney. Human data were limited to voluntary exposures for short durations and general statements about the symptoms following accidental occupational exposures to unknown concentrations of allyl alcohol for unspecified amounts of time. Animal data were limited to studies in which lethality was the only endpoint of interest, subchronic exposures, or single-exposure experiments in which the model was questionable.\n\nThe basis for derivation of AEGL-1 values was human data that reported exposure to 6.25 pprn allyl alcohol for 5 minutes resulted in slight or moderate nose irritation in 316 or 116 volunteers, respectively (Dunlap et al., 1958). An intraspecies uncertainty factor of 3 was used because irritation is not likely to vary greatly among individuals. The same 2.1 pprn value was applied across the 10-and 30-minute, and 1-, 4-, and 8-hour exposure times because mild irritancy generally does not vary greatly over time, and prolonged exposure is not expected to result in an enhanced effect.\n\nThe basis for derivation of AEGL-2 values was the human data from Dunlap et al. (1958). At 12.5 pprn for 5 minutes, moderate or greater nose irritation was reported in 4 of 7 volunteers, and 117 reported slight eye irritation. At 25 pprn for 5 minutes, severe eye irritation and moderate nose irritation were reported in 515 subjects. The 12.5 pprn was taken as a no-effect-level for severe eye irritation. An intraspecies uncertainty factor of 3 was applied based on the steep doseresponse curve for eye irritation in humans (only one individual reported slight eye irritation at 6.25 or 12.5 pprn for 5 minutes, while all 5 individuals reported severe eye irritation at 25.0 pprn for 5 minutes). The same 4.2 pprn value was applied across the 10-and 30-minute, and I-, 4-, and 8-hour exposure times because mild irritancy generally does not vary greatly over time, and because it is not expected that prolonged exposure will result in an enhanced effect.\n\nThe highest concentration causing no mortality in mice, rats, and rabbits of 200 pprn for 1 hour was chosen as the AEGL-3 endpoint (Union Carbide, 195 1). The highest concentration causing no mortality was identical in all three species. At higher exposures each of these species had mortality. These data suggest little difference between species in response to allyl alcohol exposure. Therefore, the interspecies uncertainty factor was set to 1. An intraspecies uncertainty factor of 3 was chosen. Although the traditional approach for uncertainty factors in a case such as this would argue for an uncertainty factor of 10 because of the lack of data addressing interindividual variability, this would result in a composite uncertainty factor of 10. An uncertainty factor of 10 would drive the AEGL-3 values to levels inconsistent with available empirical data. A total uncertainty factor of 10 would result in 1,4, and 8-hour AEGL-3 values of 20,5.1, and 2.5 ppm, respectively. Dunlap et al. (1958) reported that rats exposed for 7 hrld, 5 dayslwk for 60 exposures to 1,2, or 5 pprn had no observable adverse effects, while rats exposed to 20 pprn only exhibited decreased body weight gain. Torkelson et al. (1959) reported that no adverse effects were noted when rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs were exposed to 2 pprn for 7 hrld, 5 d/wk for 28 exposures, while exposure of rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits to 7 pprn for 7 hrld, 5 d/wk for 134 exposures resulted only in reversible liver and kidney damage.\n\nThe experimentally derived exposure value was then scaled to AEGL time Erames using the concentration-time relationship given by the equation @ x t = k, where C = concentration, t = time, k is a constant, and n generally ranges from 1 to 3.5 (ten Berge et al., 1986). To calculate n for allyl alcohol, a regression plot of the LC,, values was derived from the rat LC,, data (1 -, 4-, and 8-hour LC,, values of 1060, 165, and 76 ppm, respectively) from Dunlap et al. (1958) The regression analysis resulted in an n value of 0.78. The NAC committee recommended using an n of 1 (C1 x t = k ; Haber's Law) for consistency with other chemicals when an n of less than 1 is derived from the data.\n\nThe 10-minute AEGL-3 value was set equal to the 30-minute value. Repeated 7-hour and 8hour exposures at 100 pprn required 32 or more days for all rats to die (Dunlap et al., 1958;Shell Chemical Corporation, 1957). At 150 ppm, however, all rats in one study (Shell Chemical Corporation, 1957), and 8 of 10 of the rats in the other study (Dunlap et al., 1958) died by the end of the first two exposures. In order not to exceed the 150 pprn concentration that killed almost all the animals in only two 7-or %-hour exposures, the calculated 10-minute value of 400 pprn was set equal to the 30-minute value of 130 ppm.\n\nThe derived AEGL values are listed in the table.
