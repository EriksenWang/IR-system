    "abstract": "Long-term monitoring projects and studies designed to survey large, variable areas often face a similar challenge: data collection. Researchers can sometimes overcome this obstacle by designing studies that utilize the skills of volunteers, or citizen scientists. Citizen scientists currently play active roles in a wide range of ecological projects, and their contributions have enabled scientists to collect large amounts of data at minimal cost. Because birdwatching is popular among members of the general public, bird-monitoring projects have been among the most successful at integrating citizen scientists. Several large-scale studies, such as the Christmas Bird Count and Breeding Bird Survey, have successfully relied on citizen scientists to collect data. As urban areas expand and scientists work to find ways to manage wildlife in cities, information about the associations among animals and urban environments is needed. By utilizing the large pool of potential participants in urban areas, citizen sciencebased studies can play an important role in collecting this information. One such study, the Tucson Bird Count (TBC), has successfully utilized citizen scientists to collect information on the distribution and abundance of birds across an urban area. The results from the TBC have been used in numerous scientific studies, and they are helping wildlife managers identify important sites for birds within the city, as well as land-use practices that sustain native birds.",
    "full_text": "The value of employing volunteers from the general public (i.e., citizen scientists) to collect data has been recognized for a long time, but there has been a recent surge in studies based on citizen science. Although many early citizen science programs were primarily conceived as educational tools -as a way to increase participants' knowledge about science (Brossard, Lewenstein & Bonney, 2005)-there has been a growing focus on the use of citizen scientists to collect long-term data (Brewer, 2002;Evans et al., 2005). For research projects that require many observers, such as studies designed to assess the status of local resources, establish baseline ecological measures, or identify the impacts of various activities on environmental quality, citizen scientists can be a remarkable resource (Ely, 2000;Altizer, Hochachka & Dhondt, 2004). In many cases, lone professional scientists, lacking the necessary funding and manpower, are unable to gather the broad-scaled yet detailed information that a cadre of citizen scientists can. As a result, citizen scientists are currently active participants in a wide range of ecological projects, including studies of macroinvertebrates and stream health (Fore, Paulsen & O'Laughlin, 2001), the status of reef fish and amphibian populations (Pattengill-Semmens & Semmens, 2003;Ebersole, 2003), and the distribution and abundance of monarch butterflies in North America (Monarch Larva Monitoring Project, 2001).\n\nOne area in which citizen scientists are widely utilized is in surveying and monitoring bird populations (Lepczyk, 2005). Several large-scale bird-monitoring projects, such as the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), Christmas Bird Count (CBC), and Project FeederWatch (PFW) rely on volunteers to collect data. The involvement of citizen scientists in these projects provides the sponsoring agencies (BBS = the United States Geologic Survey and the Canadian Wildlife Service, CBC = the National Audubon Society, PFW = the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Bird Studies Canada) with data that allow them to generate detailed distribution maps for species throughout the United States and monitor changes in bird populations over time (Root, 1988;Sauer, 2003). Additionally, data collected through these programs have been utilized in numerous scientific studies (see LePage & Francis, 2002;Sauer, Hines & Fallon, 2003;Dunn et al., 2005).\n\nThe benefits of incorporating citizen science into ecological research are not limited to the quantity of data that can be collected. Citizen science projects can also benefit the volunteers and the broader community. Volunteers not only gain experience in making observations and participating in a scientific study, they may also develop a greater sense of stewardship over the populations or sites they are responsible for surveying or monitoring (Carr, 2004).\n\nThe broader community benefits from an increased sense of stewardship among the citizen scientists and from the fact that the data collected can serve to inform local planning and land-use decisions (Nerbonne & Nelson, 2004). In addition, when the results of citizen science projects are made accessible to the public, they can help to increase residents' knowledge and appreciation of both their local ecological resources and the scientific process (Brewer, 2002).\n\nDespite the value of volunteers to research programs and the potential benefits to both participants and the broader community, citizen science-based projects have been criticized for lacking scientific rigor (Irwin, 1995). In order to encourage the participation of volunteers, scientists design programs that attempt to both minimize the time and effort required of participants and maximize the output of usable data. As a result, the design of such programs is often a compromise. The CBC, for example, has been criticized because there is variability in volunteer effort among and within count circles, and because the count circles are not randomly located (Dunn et al., 2005). Lack of randomly located survey sites is an issue with many citizen science projects because sites tend to be clustered near population centers (where the majority of participants live) or in ecologically rich areas (which participants are more interested in surveying).\n\nAdditional concerns about the quality of data collected by citizen scientists include variability in skill levels among volunteers, underreporting of negative results, and the impact of participants' biases on data quality (Irwin). In response to these concerns, many existing projects have developed innovative ways to standardize data collection (Dunn et al.) to make analysis and interpretation of results more reliable.  , 2004). Another project that has utilized citizen scientists to collect data on bird abundances and distributions in an urban area is the Tucson Bird Count (Tucson Bird Count, n.d.).\n\nThe Tucson Bird Count (TBC) is a volunteer-based bird-monitoring project in Tucson, Arizona (Turner, 2003). The TBC was established in 2001 to acquire information about the distribution and abundances of birds throughout the Tucson area. Tucson has been the setting for many studies investigating the relationships among birds and urban environments (see Emlen, 1974;Tweit & Tweit, 1986;Mills, Dunning Jr. & Bates, 1989;Germaine, Rosenstock, Schweinsburg & Richardson, 1998), but each of these studies was restricted in coverage, in space, or in time.\n\nFurthermore, nationwide bird-monitoring programs, like the CBC and the BBS, do not provide detailed information on birds in Tucson. The CBC includes a count circle in Tucson, but due to the nature of this project, surveys occur in the winter, when many species that breed in or migrate through Tucson are not present (National Audubon Society, 2005). And though the BBS surveys birds during the spring breeding season, urban areas are generally avoided in count circle placement (O'Connor et al., 2000), and there are no BBS survey sites in Tucson (Sauer et al., 2005).\n\nThe long-term goal of the TBC is to help identify ways to restore and sustain native bird species (Turner, 2003). The initial design of the TBC focused on counting birds at random sites covering a wide range of environments throughout Tucson during the breeding season (the Route Program). The original sampling scheme allowed for inferences about bird/habitat associations to be drawn from the TBC data (Ramsey & Schafer, 2002)  1). Due to the volunteer-based nature of the TBC and the fact that participants select the routes they want to survey, there is no guarantee that all routes will be adopted every year. As a result, each year a few routes are not surveyed. To avoid gaps in coverage, routes that were not surveyed one year are given priority the following year, or are surveyed by TBC staff.\n\nLocations monitored in the Park Monitoring Program (red stars in Figure 1) were selected by TBC personnel and volunteers and include neighborhood, city, and regional parks, washes, a national park, and other key birding spots (referred to as parks here).\n\nThe number of survey sites per park varies from 3 to 14, depending on the size of the site and the variability of environments contained within the park.  (Sutherland, Newton & Green, 2004), or at sites where the structure of the vegetation is more conducive to the use of line transects (e.g., a wash bordered by riparian vegetation), participants survey 200-meter transects for ten minutes (Bibby, Burgess & Hill, 1992). To reduce the chances of double-counting birds, point-count locations are separated by at least 250 meters, and transects do not cross each other (Sutherland et al.). Currently, the TBC surveys 178 sites in 21 parks in the Tucson area through its Park Monitoring Program.\n\nThe TBC is performed primarily by volunteer birders from the Tucson community. In order to ensure that data collected in the TBC is of high quality, participants must be knowledgeable birders. To participate in the TBC, volunteers must meet the project's definition of a skilled observer, defined as \"one who can identify the 25 most common Tucsonarea species quickly by sight or sound, is familiar with most other birds of the Tucson area, and may need quick reference to a field guide for certain lesscommon or difficult-to-separate species\" (Turner, 2003). To determine if participants meet this criteria, volunteers are required to take a self-test at the TBC website prior to adopting a route.\n\nThe TBC website was designed to facilitate participants' involvement in the project, make the data collected through the project easily accessible to the public, and provide information about the project to interested parties. At the website, participants can register for the TBC, take the required self-test, view a map of available routes, select a route or park to survey, enter their data, and view results. Enabling participants to carry out these administrative tasks themselves reduces the burden on TBC personnel and speeds up the process. An additional benefit of participants entering their data via the website is a decreased risk of transcription mistakes, as  (Gough, Sauer & Iliff, 1998) for more than 150 species found in the Tucson area.\n\nThe results and information available at the TBC website are also intended to inform researchers and local decision makers about the TBC and the data available from it. One of the advantages of having the TBC data in a digital database is that this data can be easily accessed by other users (Dunn et al., 2005).\n\nThe TBC website contains a listing of projects, presentations, and publications that have made use of the TBC data so far.\n\nData collected by citizen scientists through the TBC has enabled the generation of detailed Tucson-area distribution maps for more than 200 bird species.\n\nThese maps indicate that many species follow distinct distribution patterns in Tucson. A group of native desert birds, exemplified by Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii), have similar distributions, with relatively high numbers of individuals on the less developed edges of Tucson, but few individuals occupying the city's more urbanized center (Turner, 2003; Figure 2). Rock pigeons (Columba livia), on the other hand, are among a group of species that exhibit the inverse pattern, reaching their highest abundances toward Tucson's urban core (Figure 3).\n\nOther distribution patterns are apparent in the data, including the restriction of some species to riparian areas and the concentration of others in areas of relatively dense native woodlands (Turner, 2003). Some bird species, such as mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), Gila woodpeckers (Melanerpes uropygialis), and house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) have been counted in relatively high numbers at almost every survey point (Figure 4). Yet species more sensitive to development, such as the rufous-winged sparrow (Aimophila carpalis), are found in relatively small numbers and only at the very edges of the city (Figure 5).\n\nScientists have used TBC results to assess how species respond to different types of land use (Turner, 2003), investigate the relationship between the distribution of birds and people in Tucson (Turner, Nakamura & Dinetti, 2004), and examine the effects of nonnative cavity-nesting birds on the health of saguaro cacti (Carnegiea gigantea; Hutton, 2005). In addition, data from the TBC have served as baseline information for a number of scientific studies, ranging from an investigation of the impact of West Nile virus on Tucson's birds to a comparison of riparian birds in Tucson and Phoenix riparian areas.\n\nThe TBC data has also been used in local land-use planning (Pima County, 2004), and to evaluate potential sites for natural resource parks (Rosen & Mauz, 2001).\n\nWhile the TBC is an example of how citizen science and urban ecological monitoring can be integrated,\n\nThe TBC demonstrates the value of utilizing citizen scientists to collect citywide data for monitoring urban birds. Currently, the TBC is the only recurring volunteer-based, citywide urban bird-monitoring project in the world (Turner, 2003). Lessons learned through the TBC about study design, volunteer management, and the importance of making results available and useful may be helpful in the establishment of other urban bird-monitoring projects.\n\nUrban areas offer enormous potential for citizen science projects, not least because a large number of prospective volunteers are already in place. The ecology of urban areas is a growing field that requires further investigation; the type and scope of information citizen scientists can provide is invaluable. In the case of bird-related projects, there is the additional advantage that many experienced birders are interested in participating in projects designed to benefit birds, and they bring an established skill set to the project.\n\nThe breadth of data that can be collected by an organized group of citizen scientists allows researchers to conduct studies that might otherwise"
