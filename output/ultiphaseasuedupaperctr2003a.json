    "abstract": "Atomization processes play an important role in a wide variety of technical applications and natural phenomena, ranging from inkjet printers, gas turbines, direct injection ICengines, and cryogenic rocket engines to ocean wave breaking and hydrothermal features. The atomization process of liquid jets and sheets is usually divided into two consecutive steps: the primary and the secondary breakup. During primary breakup, the liquid jet or sheet exhibits large scale coherent structures that interact with the gas-phase and break up into both large and small scale drops. During secondary breakup, these drops break up into ever smaller drops that finally may evaporate.\nUsually, the atomization process occurs in a turbulent environment, involving a wide range of time and length scales. Given today's computational resources, the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the turbulent breakup process as a whole, resolving all physical processes, is impossible, except for some very simple configurations. Instead, models describing the physics of the atomization process have to be employed.\nVarious models have already been developed for the secondary breakup process. There, it can be assumed that the characteristic length scale ℓ of the drops is much smaller than the available grid resolution ∆x and that the liquid volume fraction in each grid cell Θ l is small, see Fig.\n1\n. Furthermore, assuming simple geometrical shapes of the individual drops, like spheres or ellipsoids, the interaction between these drops and the surrounding fluid can be taken into account. Statistical models describing the secondary breakup process in turbulent environments can thus be derived (O",

(Brackbill et al. 1988;Rider & Kothe 1995;Unverdi & Tryggvason 1992), the Volume-of-Fluid method (Noh & Woodward 1976;Kothe & Rider 1994;Gueyffier et al. 1999), or the level set method (Osher & Sethian 1988;Sussman et al. 1994Sussman et al. , 1998)). Then, introducing ensemble averaging or spatial filtering results in unclosed terms that require modeling (Brocchini & Peregrine 2001a,b). Unfortunately, the derivation of such closure models is not straightforward and, hence, has not been achieved yet. This is in part due to the fact that, with the exception of the surface tension term, all other physical processes occurring at the phase interface itself, like for example stretching, are not described by explicit source terms. Instead, they are hidden within the interdependence between the Navier-Stokes equations and the respective interface tracking equation. Thus, a formulation containing the source terms explicitly could greatly facilitate any attempt to derive the appropriate closure models.\n\nTo this end, a novel three-dimensional Eulerian level set/vortex sheet method is proposed. Its advantage is the fact that it contains explicit source terms for each individual physical process that occurs at the phase interface. It thus constitutes a promising framework for the derivation of the LSS subgrid closure models.\n\nThis paper is divided into four parts. First, the level set/vortex sheet method for threedimensional two-phase interface dynamics is presented. Second, the LSS model for the primary breakup of turbulent liquid jets and sheets is outlined and all terms requiring subgrid modeling are identified. Then, preliminary three-dimensional results of the level set/vortex sheet method are presented and discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and an outlook to future work is given.\n\nThe aim of the level set/vortex sheet method is to describe the dynamics of the phase interface Γ between two inviscid, incompressible fluids 1 and 2, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, the velocity u i on either side i of the interface Γ is determined by the incompressible Euler equations, given here in dimensionless form,\n\nsubjected to the boundary conditions at the interface Γ,\n\nand at infinity,\n\nHere, n is the interface normal vector, η is the vortex sheet strength, and κ is the local curvature of Γ. The Weber number is defined as\n\nwhere Σ is the surface tension coefficient and ρ ref , u ref , and L ref are the reference density, velocity, and length, respectively. An interface subjected to the above boundary conditions is called a vortex sheet (Saffman & Baker 1979).\n\nThe partial differential equation describing the evolution of the vortex sheet strength η can be derived by combining the Euler equations, Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), with the boundary conditions at the interface, Eqs. (2.3)-(2.5), resulting in (Pozrikidis 2000)\n\n(2.8)\n\nHere, A = (ρ 1 -ρ 2 )/(ρ 1 + ρ 2 ) is the Atwood number and a is the average acceleration of fluid 1 and fluid 2 at the interface. The major advantage of Eq. (2.8), as compared to a formulation based on the Euler equations, is the fact that Eq. (2.8) contains explicit local individual source terms on the right-hand side describing the physical processes at the interface. These are, from left to right, two stretching terms, a surface tension term T σ , and a density difference term.\n\nIn addition to the evolution of the local vortex sheet strength, Eq. (2.8), the location and motion of the phase interface itself has to be known. To this end, vortex sheets are typically solved by a boundary integral method within a Lagrangian framework where the phase interface is tracked by marker particles (Baker et al. 1982;Pullin 1982;Hou et al. 1997Hou et al. , 2001;;Rangel & Sirignano 1988). Marker particles allow for highly accurate tracking of the phase interface motion in a DNS. However, the introduction of ensemble averaging and spatial filtering of the interface topology is not straightforward and hence a strategy for the derivation of appropriate LSS subgrid closure models is not directly apparent.\n\nLevel sets, on the other hand, have been successfully applied to the derivation of closure models in the field of premixed turbulent combustion (Peters 1999(Peters , 2000)). Thus, instead of using marker particles to describe the location and motion of the phase interface, here, the interface is represented by an iso-surface of the level set scalar field G(x, t), as shown in Fig. 2\n\nG(x, t) > G 0 in fluid 1, and G(x, t) < G 0 in fluid 2, an evolution equation for the scalar G can be derived by simply differentiating Eq. (2.9) with respect to time,\n\nThis equation is called the level set equation (Osher & Sethian 1988). Using the level set scalar, geometrical properties of the interface, like its normal vector and curvature, can be easily expressed as\n\nStrictly speaking, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) are valid only at the location of the interface itself. However, to facilitate the numerical solution of both equations in the whole computational domain, η is set constant in the interface normal direction, ∇η • ∇G = 0 , (2.12) and G is chosen to be a distance function away from the interface,\n\nEquations (2.8) and (2.10) are coupled by the self-induced velocity u of the vortex sheet. To calculate u, the vector potential ψ is introduced, ∆ψ = ω .\n\n(2.14)\n\nHere, the vorticity vector ω is calculated following a vortex-in-cell type approach (Christiansen 1973; Cottet & Koumoutsakos 2000)\n\nwhere δ is the delta-function. Then, u can be calculated from\n\n(2.16)\n\nIn summary, Eqs. (2.8), (2.10), and (2.14) -(2.16) describe the three-dimensional twophase interface dynamics and constitute the level set/vortex sheet method.\n\nNumerically, Eqs. (2.8) and (2.10) are solved in a narrow band (Peng et al. 1999) by a third-order WENO scheme (Jiang & Peng 2000) using a third-order TVD Runge-\n\nKutta time discretization (Shu & Osher 1989). The redistribution of η (2.12) is solved by a Fast Marching Method (Sethian 1996;Adalsteinsson & Sethian 1999), whereas the reinitialization of G (2.13) is solved by an iterative procedure (Sussman et al. 1994;Peng et al. 1999). The interested reader is referred to Herrmann (2002) for a detailed description of the numerical methods employed in the level set/vortex sheet method.\n\nThe basic idea of the LSS model is to split the treatment of the primary breakup process into two parts. All phase interface dynamics occurring on scales larger than the local grid size are explicitly resolved and tracked by a level set approach, whereas interface dynamics occurring on subgrid scales are described by an appropriate subgrid model. Furthermore, the LSS subgrid model has to separate out all broken off subgrid scale liquid drops and transfer them to a secondary breakup model.\n\nThe level set equation describing the interface location and motion on the resolved scales can be derived by first introducing appropriate interface based filters (Oberlack et al. 2001) into the level set equation (2.10), see Fig. 3,\n\nHere, • denotes quantities on the resolved (filter) scale. Furthermore, the mass transfer rate ṁp into the secondary breakup model has to be taken into account,\n\nwhere s p is the subgrid primary breakup velocity, A G0 is the local surface area of the resolved interface, and P (D) is the droplet diameter number distribution,\n\nwhere N is the total number of drops. Then, the resolved scale level set equation reads\n\nwhere n is the normal vector of the resolved scale interface,\n\nTo describe the phase interface dynamics on the resolved scale, their effect on the flow field has to be taken into account by an additional source term T in the momentum equation,\n\nHere, the first term on the right-hand side describes the effect of surface tension forces due to the local curvature κ of the resolved scale interface, whereas the second term, T SGS , accounts for the effect of the subgrid scale surface tension forces on the resolved scale flow field. Thus, the yet unclosed subgrid terms of the LSS model requiring modeling are the subgrid primary breakup velocity s p , the droplet diameter number distribution P (D), and the subgrid scale surface tension effect T SGS . As previously indicated, these subgrid terms are to be derived from the level set/vortex sheet method. Performing DNS of the primary breakup of liquid surfaces and sheets in turbulent environments will help to identify characteristic regimes of the turbulent primary breakup and their dominant physical processes. These can then be quantified using the explicit source terms in the η-equation (2.8), thus providing guidelines for the derivation of appropriate LSS subgrid models.\n\nIn order to both validate the three-dimensional level set/vortex sheet method and to demonstrate its ability to perform DNS of the primary breakup process, the results of two different cases are presented. First, the calculated oscillation periods of liquid columns and spheres are compared to theoretical results. Then, the breakups of a randomly perturbed liquid surface and sheet are presented.\n\nTo validate the proposed level set/vortex sheet method, the calculated oscillation periods T of liquid columns and spheres of mean radius R = 0.25, center x c = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), amplitude = 0.05R, and Atwood number A = 0 are compared to theoretical results (Lamb 1945). The initial vortex sheet strength in both cases is set to\n\nAll calculations are performed in a unit sized box resolved by an equidistant cartesian grid of 128 × 128 and 128 × 128 × 128 nodes, respectively. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the surface tension term T σ of the η-equation (2.8) in the x-, y-, and z-direction,\n\nfor the oscillating sphere of mode number n = 5 and Weber number We = 10 calculated at t = 0. As the shape of the sphere indicates, T σ in the x-direction is a factor of roughly four higher than T σ in the other two directions, leading to the predominant oscillation in the y-z-plane. Figure 5 depicts the comparison of the oscillation period for the oscillating columns on the left-hand side and the oscillating spheres on the right-hand side for two different Weber numbers. As can be clearly seen, agreement between simulation and theory is very good.\n\nTo demonstrate the capability of the proposed level set/vortex sheet method to simulate the primary breakup process, the temporal evolution of both a randomly perturbed liquid surface and sheet are simulated. In the case of the liquid surface, the on average flat interface located at z = 0 is perturbed in the z-direction by a Fourier series of 64 sinusoidal waves in both the x-and y-direction with random amplitude 0 < < 0.01 and random phase shift. In the case of the liquid sheet, the two on average flat interfaces are located at z = -B/2 and z = +B/2 and are again perturbed by two Fourier series of 64 sinusoidal waves. The thickness of the liquid sheet is set to B = 0.1.\n\nThe initial vortex sheet strength for the liquid surface is set to η(x, t = 0) = (-1, 0, 0) (4.3) and to η(x, t = 0) = (-1, 0, 0) : z > 0 ( 1, 0, 0) : z ≤ 0 , (4.4) in the liquid sheet case. Both, the surface and the sheet simulation were performed in a x-and y-direction periodic box of size [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [-1, 1] resolved by a cartesian grid of 64 × 64 × 128 equidistant nodes. In both simulations, the Atwood number is A = 0. The Weber number in the surface simulation is We = 500 and the Weber number in the sheet simulation based on the sheet thickness is We B = 100. As depicted in Fig. 6, the surface shows an initial growth of two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (t = 1). These continue to grow (t = 3) and form three-dimensional structures (t = 5) resulting in elongated fingers (t = 6.5) that finally initiate breakup (t = 8.0).\n\nThe liquid sheet, depicted in Fig. 7, also exhibits the initial formation of two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (t = 1) that continue to grow (t = 3) until the liquid film gets too thin and ruptures (t = 5). Individual fingers are formed that extend mostly in the transverse direction (t = 8) and continue to break up into individual drops of varying sizes (t = 12).\n\nA Eulerian level set/vortex sheet method has been presented that allows for the threedimensional calculation of the phase interface dynamics between two inviscid and incompressible fluids. Results obtained with the proposed method for oscillating columns and spheres show very good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the applicability of the method to the primary breakup process has been demonstrated by simulations of the breakup of both a liquid surface and a liquid sheet.\n\nIn addition, the LSS model for turbulent primary breakup has been outlined, and all terms requiring subgrid modeling have been identified. The proposed level set/vortex sheet method has the advantage that it allows for the detailed study of each individual physical process occurring at the phase interface. It thus provides a promising framework for the derivation of the LSS subgrid models.\n\nFuture work will focus on including the effect of non-zero Atwood numbers and on coupling of the level set/vortex sheet method to an outside turbulent flow field. Also, the level set/vortex sheet method will be parallelized making use of the new domain decom- position parallelization of the Fast Marching Method presented in Herrmann (2003). This will allow for efficient DNS of the primary breakup process to help identify the different regimes of turbulent primary breakup and their dominant physical processes, facilitating the derivation of the LSS subgrid models. Finally, combining the LSS model to spray models describing the secondary breakup will allow for the first LES of the turbulent atomization process as a whole."
