    "abstract": "The vertebrate striated muscle Z-band connects actin filaments of opposite polarity from adjacent sarcomeres and allows tension to be transmitted along a myofibril during contraction. Z-bands in different muscles have a modular structure formed by layers of a-actinin molecules cross-linking actin filaments. Successive layers occur at 19 nm intervals and have 908 rotations between them. 3D reconstruction from electron micrographs show a two-layer \"simple\" Z-band in fish body fast muscle, a three-layer Z-band in fish fin fast muscle, and a six-layer Z-band in mammalian slow muscle. Related to the number of these layers, longitudinal sections of the Z-band show a number of zigzag connections between the oppositely oriented actin filaments. The number of layers also determines the axial width of the Z-band, which is a useful indicator of fibre type; fast fibres have narrow (, 30-50 nm) Z-bands; slow and cardiac fibres have wide (, 100 -140 nm) Z-bands. Here, we report the first observation of two different Z-band widths within a single sarcomere. By comparison with previous studies, the narrower Z-band comprises three layers. Since the increase in width of the wider Z-band is about 19 nm, we conclude that it comprises four layers. This finding is consistent with a Z-band assembly model involving molecular control mechanisms that can add additional layers of 19 nm periodicity. These multiple Z-band structures suggest that different isoforms of nebulin and titin with a variable number of Z-repeats could be present within a single sarcomere.",
    "full_text": "The Z-band in vertebrate striated muscle is an intriguing structure that tethers anti-parallel actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres into a tetragonal lattice. 1,2 The Z-band serves to transmit tension generated by muscular activity from sarcomere to sarcomere along a muscle. The width of the Z-band observed in electron micrographs of longitudinal sections is considered to be a fundamental property of the muscle fibre type. 3,4 Cardiac muscle and slow muscle fibres possess wide , 100 -130 nm Z-bands 4,5 and fast muscle fibres have narrow , 50 nm Z-bands. 6,7 Fish body white muscle (fast) has a narrow, simple Z-band that shows in certain longitudinal views a single set of zigzag links connecting the anti-parallel actin filaments. 7,8 The links connecting anti-parallel actin filaments are probably formed by a-actinin. 9 3D reconstruction of the Z-band in fish body white muscle shows that it is composed of two sets of Z-links. 7 The Z-band in fish fin muscle, also fast, studied in place, is wider and comprises three sets of Z-links. 6 3D reconstruction of a wide Z-band from a slow muscle showed that it comprises six layers of Z-links. 5 a-Actinin cross-links actin stereospecifically with 4 1 screw symmetry and forms layers separated by 19 nm 10 as found in nemaline rod Z-crystals. 11 Each layer is characterised by two nearly diametrically opposed a-actinin molecules emanating from one actin filament and binding to two anti-parallel actin filaments from the adjoining sarcomere. The links in successive layers are rotated around the actin filament by 908.\n\nVertebrate cardiac muscle and the different isoforms of skeletal muscle are characterised by different mechanical properties that are suited to different physiological demands. 12 There are several differences between the muscles, including the myosin heavy chain isoforms, MyBP-C (C-protein) isoforms, structure of the M-band, the number of mitochondria and the mode of energy usage. Since the Z-band is part of the tension chain during contraction, the variation in width (and number of a-actinin layers) is presumed to relate to the mechanical needs of the muscle. Whereas, some muscles have homogeneous fibre composition, e.g. the fast fibres in fish body white muscle and chicken pectoralis muscle, and the slow fibres in rat soleus muscle, many vertebrate muscles are composed of a mixed population of different isoforms. This is generally considered as \"fine tuning\" of the muscle to the various mechanical demands.\n\nIn this study, we report the first observation of two different Z-band widths within a single myofibril. We identify the difference in structure between these two types of Z-band. The variation that we have observed is probably due to the addition of one extra level of a-actinin crosslinks.\n\nThe nomenclature of the main Z-band views discussed in this work is illustrated in Figure 1 (following the convention for labelling the lattice views adopted in previous work 6 ). These views, produced in the electron microscope by projecting onto the film or screen the tetragonal-based Z-band, comprise the orthogonal pair, the 10 and 01 views, and halfway between them, the 11 view. shown in red and green. In the electron microscope, an image is formed by projecting the density through a sample onto the screen or electron microscope film. When the cube (section) is tilted about the Z-axis (myofibril axis), various lattice views would be seen in the electron microscope, as different features coincide along the direction of view. Projecting along the primary lattice directions gives the 10 and 01 views, and halfway between them, the 11 view.\n\nA longitudinal section of frog sartorius muscle in the relaxed state prepared by rapid freezing/freeze substitution is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(a) and (b) show two different views of the same myofibril at different tilts about the myofibril axis: (a) shows the 10 and (b) the 11 view of the Z-band. The preservation of the muscle structure is exceptionally good, as illustrated by the highly regular 43 nm bands (arrowed) and highly regular 2D patterns within the A-band. The extraordinary feature of these micrographs is the Z-band. Part of the Z-band is narrow (N) and the rest wide (W). This is not an artefact produced by the lattice view: it is seen clearly in both pictures, even though these are different tilt views of the same myofibril. Checking the distribution of the wide and narrow Z-bands in low-magnification micrographs that show a large field of sarcomeres, the wide Z-band represents about 10% of the total amount of Z-band. Hence the narrow form is the dominant Z-band in this muscle. We noticed in these low-power micrographs that the wide Z-bands occurred sporadically rather than regularly along a myofibril. We did not notice any other differences accompanying the Z-band widths that were related to fibre type characteristics like the M-band. 13 Higher-magnification views of the wide and narrow Z-band regions boxed in red and blue in (a) are shown in Figure 2(d) and (e), respectively, along with the density profiles. The density profiles are shown superimposed in Figure 2(f) using the same colour scheme. The width of the central high-density region, called the overlap-region, 6 was measured for several wide and narrow Z-bands in these preparations and the results are summarised in Table 1.\n\nAs in previous studies on Z-band structure, 5,6 Fourier-filtered images of ordered lattice views reveal valuable details of the structure of the wide and narrow Z-bands discussed here. Figure 3(a) shows a Fourier-filtered 10 view of the narrow form. Figure 3(c) and (d) show the 10 and 01 views for the wide Z-band. Figure 3(b) shows a Fourier-filtered image of the 10 view in fish fin muscle from a previous study. 6 The images for the narrow Z-band in Figure 3(a) and the fish fin Z-band in Figure 3(b) are very similar, with a single zigzag link between the adjacent actin filaments, and a characteristic bulbous density (D) in each. Since the fish fin Z-band was found to comprise three a-actinin layers, it is likely that the frog narrow Z-band also comprises three such layers.\n\nThe Z-band patterns observed in this Figure for the narrow and wide Z-bands are correlated to possible 3D structures in Discussion.\n\nThe variation in Z-band width observed here affects the actin filament lengths emanating from the wide and narrow Z-bands. Previous work has shown that actin filaments from adjoining sarcomeres overlap within the Z-band. 5,6,14 The finding here of two different widths within a single Z-band means that the actin filaments associated with these regions must also have different lengths. This is illustrated in Figure 2(b) and (c). The boundary of the H-zone, defined by the free ends of the actin filaments in the A-band, appears as a clear, sharp change in density in these micrographs. An example of this boundary is shown by the vertical arrow labelled H in Figure 2(b). We noticed that the H-zone boundary is straight and continuous even when the respective Z-band regions change width. Hence, if we draw the path of actin filaments from the H-zone to the opposite end of the respective wide and narrow Z-bands, we notice that the actin filaments associated with the wider Z-band (shown in red) are longer than those associated with the narrower Z-band (blue). As highlighted in the drawing in Figure 2(c), the increase in the width occurs on only one side of the Z-band (left in this case) while the other edge is quite continuous. The difference in the filament length is the same as the difference in the Z-band widths, 18.6 nm. Figure 2(c) also illustrates that in the left sarcomere, the actin filaments (shown in grey) have the same termination edges in the Z-band and the H-zone and hence they have the same lengths.\n\nValuable insight into the 3D structure of the two types of Z-bands observed in frog sartorius muscle is obtained by comparing the images obtained here with those from previous studies where the 3D structure has been analysed. The Fourier-filtered images in Figure 3 show that the narrower Z-band observed here (Figure 3(a)) bears most resemblance to the Z-band in fish fin muscle (Figure 3(b)). 6 The distinctive features in the fish Z-band in Figure 3(b) are the bulbous density (e.g. D) and below that the single zigzag links that connect the actin filaments from the two adjoining sarcomeres. Very similar features are seen in the frog Z-band in Figure 3(a) including the bulbous density and the single zigzag below. The 3D reconstruction of the fish Z-band has shown that it is composed of three a-actinin layers. Hence, the narrow Z-band in frog sartorius muscle that we have observed here must presumably also be composed of three layers.\n\nOur measurements of the width of the Z-bands in frog sartorius muscle show that the wide Z-band in this muscle is about 19 nm wider than the narrower one. This implies that the wide Z-band must be composed of four layers of a-actinin. This finding is consistent with a Z-band assembly model involving molecular control mechanisms that can add additional layers of 19 nm periodicity. 6,15 Modular patterns of vertebrate Z-bands From the observations of the two types of Z-bands here and previous 3D analyses of vertebrate Z-bands, we can summarise the schematic views of different types of vertebrate muscle Z-bands as shown in Figure 4. The Z-bands shown are due to the following number of a-actinin layers: (a) two layers as in the fast fish body white muscle, 7 (b) three layers as found in the fish fin muscle, 6 (c) four layers (this work) and (d) six layers as found in slow muscle (bovine neck muscle). 5 The main features of the patterns are dense zigzag links and periodic dense bars (referred to as bulbous density in fish fin muscle Z-band). The zigzag links occur as a projection of two a-actinin layers. The slender zigzag links shown with broken lines are due to a single a-actinin layer and are not normally seen in conventional , 100 nm sections. This Figure makes the Z-band patterns easy to understand and one can construct the expected patterns for other Z-bands including five layers (not seen yet), and seven layers (predicted for mammalian heart muscle from studies of the titin Z-repeats 16 ). From this Figure, one can predict the composition of a new Z-band by looking for the 10 and 01 views. An important first step is to identify whether the pattern has approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry as in Figure 4(a), (c) and (d), which indicates an The narrow frog Z-band (a) and the fish Z-band (b) have distinct common features including marked bulbous densities (e.g. D) and below that a single zigzag connection between the actin filaments from the adjoining sarcomeres. Since 3D reconstruction shows that the fish fin Z-band is composed of a stack of three a-actinin layers, 6 the narrow frog Z-band probably also comprises three a-actinin layers. The wide Z-band, which is about 18 nm wider than the narrow form, must therefore be composed of four a-actinin layers. even number of a-actinin layers. Lack of 2-fold symmetry, as in Figure 4(b) for plaice fin muscle, indicates an odd number of a-actinin layers.\n\nThe elastic molecule titin (also called connectin) spans half sarcomeres from the M-band to the Z-band. Analysis of its sequence shows, repeating modules of different types. The presence of multiple binding sites for other myofibrillar proteins and the expression of different size classes of titins in correlation with sarcomere structure suggest that titin may form the template for assembly of various parts of the sarcomere, including the myosin filament, M-band and C-zone. 17 In the region of titin within the Z-band, Gautel et al. 15 found that titin comprises repeating modules of  5 The main features of these Z-band patterns are successive layers of zigzag links and periodic dense bars (called bulbous density in fish fin muscle Z-band). Each zigzag link is an apparent aggregate of two a-actinin layers caused by the 908 relative rotation between these layers. The slender zigzag links shown with broken lines are formed by one a-actinin layer and are not normally seen in conventional , 100 nm thick sections. The idea of producing this Figure is that in the future, these patterns can be used to identify the number of a-actinin layers in the Z-bands of any vertebrate striated muscle, giving a more precise measure of the Z-band structure than just the width of the Z-band. about 45 residues. The number of these modules, called Z-repeats, varies with fibre type: fast muscles with narrow Z-bands have two to four Z-repeats and slow muscles and cardiac muscles with wide Z-bands have four to seven Z-repeats. 16,18 Gautel et al. 15 proposed that the titin Z-repeats may form the template for assembly of the Z-band in different muscles. This model requires that the axial span of a Z-repeat matches the axial span of a Z-link layer. Atkinson et al. 19 have studied the binding of Z-repeat Zr7 to a-actinin and they estimate that the maximum length of the Z-repeat is 12 nm. Since all the Z-repeats have similar sequences, the implication is that they all have similar axial lengths. We recently investigated the span of Z-link layers from the axial periodicity in the Z-band 10 and found that it is 19.4 nm, a value that is close to half the natural periodicity of actin filaments (38.5 nm). The results from the present study add an independent value for the span of a Z-link layer, by measuring it directly. The value found here, , 18.5 nm, confirms our previous result. Hence, as we suggested previously, 10 two Z-repeats may be required for each a-actinin layer if the Z-repeats are to form the template for assembly of the Z-band as suggested by Gautel et al. 15 . However, this means that there are not enough Z-repeats to form the Z-band template. The problem could be resolved if titin filaments from both sides of the Z-band interact within the Z-band to contribute to the total number of Z-repeats. 20 Alternatively, nebulin filaments, which also overlap within the Z-band and have nebulin-Z-repeats that are expressed differentially in different muscle isoforms, 21,22 may be involved in the assembly of the Z-band.\n\nActin filaments in skeletal muscle have strikingly uniform lengths within individual muscle types 23,24 but in cardiac muscle the actin filaments have less precisely defined lengths. 25 3D reconstruction of Z-bands has shown that the actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres overlap within the Z-band. 5,6,26 We observed here that the edge of the H-zone is continuous between the regions associated with the wide and narrow Z-bands. The consequence of the continuous H-zone and the two different widths observed here within a single Z-band is that the actin filaments associated with these regions must also have different lengths. Since nebulin filaments are thought to determine the length of the actin filaments, 21,22 the associated nebulin filaments must have different lengths. However, the straight edge of the H-zone is parallel with various features of the thick filaments and the A-band, like the M-band and the cross-bridge array. This observation therefore favours the model proposed by Littlefield & Fowler, 23 in which a thick filament/titin scaffold may determine the length of the pointed ends of the actin filaments.\n\nWhat can be the cause of the heterogeneity in the Z-bands within a single myofibril? It may occur naturally to fine tune the mechanical response of the Z-band. It may be a snapshot in the transition of the fibre from fast to slow muscle (or vice versa), since it is well known that transitions in fibre type can occur due to different reasons such as season and mechanical stimulus. Previous research on MyBP-C (C-protein) has shown that different isoforms of the protein occur within single sarcomeres in the chicken posterior latissimus dorsi muscle. 27\n\nWe have shown in this work that in the frog sartorius muscle that we studied, there are two discrete widths of the Z-band. Our comparison with fish fin Z-band suggests that the narrower Z-band is due to three layers of a-actinin. The wider Z-band that is 18 nm wider must therefore be due to four layers of a-actinin. This finding supports a Z-band assembly model involving molecular control mechanisms that can add additional layers of 19 nm periodicity. 6,31\n\nSkinned sartorius muscle of frog (Rana pipiens) were cut into segments and attached to specimen holders and frozen rapidly by impact against a copper block cooled by liquid helium using a Cryopress. 28,29 The samples were freeze-substituted in acetone containing 0.2% (w/v) tannic acid, followed by fixation in 2% (w/v) OsO 4 in acetone at room temperature and then embedded in Polybed 812 or Araldite. Longitudinal sections ,100 nm thick were cut, stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope.\n\nThe vertebrate striated muscle Z-band presents different appearances in longitudinal sections depending on the orientation of the lattice in the section. This makes measurement of the width of the Z-band difficult and subjective. We have shown recently that to measure the width objectively and independently of the lattice orientation, we can use the density profile obtained by summing the density normal to the myofibril axis of a Z-band region. 6 We found that the profile has characteristic features in a variety of Z-bands. The profile has a central high-density region that we refer to as the overlap-region or plateau-region, since 3D reconstruction of the Z-band has shown that within this region, the actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres overlap with each other. 6 Outside the overlap region, the profiles slope sharply with prominent shoulders about halfway down the slope (an example is labelled S in Figure 2(d)). In our previous study, we defined the overlap width as the width of the profile halfway between the peak and the shoulders of the profile. 6 We defined the full-width of the Z-band as the region outside the shoulder regions and close to the base of the profile. In this work, we were able to obtain more consistent measurements from the central overlap region than from the full width of the Z-band. Assessing the magnification in electron micrographs of sectioned material is not easy, since the sample dimensions change (usually shrink) at different stages of the preparation and electron microscopy. 30 Fortunately, the Fourier transforms of the A-bands in these micrographs closely resemble the X-ray diffraction patterns of live muscle; hence the spot for the 14.3 nm spacing can be used to provide internal calibration for the magnification. This was done for each micrograph in which Z-bands were measured.\n\nFigure 2 (legend opposite)\n\nZ-band Heterogeneity Within a Single Sarcomere"
