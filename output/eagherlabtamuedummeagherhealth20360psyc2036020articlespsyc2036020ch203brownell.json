    "abstract": "This article examines relapse by integrating knowledge from the addictive disorders of alcoholism, smoking, and obesity. Commonalities across these areas suggest at least three basic stages of behavior change: motivation and commitment, initial change, and maintenance. A distinction is made between lapse and relapse, with lapse referring to the process (slips or mistakes) that may or may not lead to an outcome (relapse). The natural history of relapse is discussed, as are the consequences of relapse for patients and the professionals who treat them. Information on determinants and predictors of relapse is evaluated, with the emphasis on the interaction of individual environmental, and physiological factors. Methods of preventing relapse are proposed and are targeted to the three stages of change. Specific research needs in these areas are discussed.\nThe problem of relapse remains an important challenge in the fields dealing with health-related behaviors, particularly the addictive disorders. This is true for areas of",
    "full_text": "focused on relapse by considering both similarities and differences. In so doing, both conceptual'and practical ideas may emerge that would not be suggested by the knowledge available in any one area.\n\nRelapse rates for the addictions are assumed to be in the range of 50% to 90% (Hunt et al., 1971;Hunt & Matarazzo, 1973;Marlatt & Gordon, 1980, 1985). This underscores the importance of the problem. However; defining specific rates is difficult. Hidden within these averages is large variability. The rates depend on characteristics of the addiction, individual variables, the success of treatment, and so forth.\n\nThe figures generally cited for relapse could overestimate or underestimate actual rates. Most data are from clinical programs, so rates are based on those who have received formal treatment. These figures could overstate the problem because only difficult cases are seen and because only one attempt to change is studied (Schachter, 1982). persons attempting to change on their own may be more successful and may relapse less frequently (Schachter, 1982). The vast majority of persons who change do so on their own (Ockene, 1984). These data could understate the case because clinical programs are most likely to provide effective treatments. In addition, #arious criteria are used to define relapse. For example, relapse in alcohol studies could be defined as days intoxicated, days hospitalized o r jailed, days drinking out of control, or the use of any alcohol. This points to the need for standard definitions and for the study of the natural history of relapse.\n\nThere are two common definitions of relapse, each refleeting a bias regarding its nature and severity (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary of 1983 gives both definitions. The first is \"a recurrence of symptoms of a disease after a period of improvement.\" This refers to an outcome and implies a dichotomous view because a person is either ill and has symptoms or is well and does not. The second definition is \"the act or instance of backsliding, worsening, or subsiding.\" This focuses on a process and implies something less serious, perhaps a slip or mistake.\n\nThe choice of the process or outcome definition has important implications for conceptualizing, preventing, and treating relapse. We suggest that lapse may best describe a process, behavior, or event (Marlatt & Gordon, rhis article had its origins in a symposium on relapse at the World Congress on Behavior Therapy, Washington, I) (2,1983. This work was supported in part by Research SCientist Development Award MH00319 from NIMH and by a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to Kelly D. BrowneU, grant HL29547 to Edward Lichtenstein from NHLBI, grant AA00259 to G. Terence Wilson from NIAAA, and grant AA05591 to G. Alan Marlatt from NIAAA.\n\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Kelly D. Brownell, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, 133 South 36th St., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104. 1985). Webster's defines lapse as \"a slight error or slip 9 . . a temporary fall esp. from a higher to a lower state.\" A lapse is a single event, a reemergence of a previous habit, which may or may not lead to the state of relapse. When a slip or mistake is defined as a lapse, it implies that corrective action can be taken, not that control is lost completely. There is support for this distinction in smokers (Coppotelli & Orleans, 1985;Mermelstein & Lichtenstein, 1983) and in dieters (Dubbert & Wilson, 1984). In these cases, different determinants were found for lapses (slips) and relapses.\n\nThe challenge with this approach is defining when one or more lapses become a relapse. One former smoker may lose control with the first transgression, whereas another may smoke one cigarette each month and never lose control. A lapse, therefore, could be defined concretely as use of the substance in the case of smoking and alcoholism or violation of program guidelines for a dieter. The individual's response to these lapses determines whether relapse has occurred. This varies from person to person and may be best defined by perceived loss of control. Reliable measures do not yet exist for this assessment. Research in this area is important for the field.\n\nThe Nature and Process of R e l a p s e Surprisingly little is known about relapse in its natural state. Most data are from clinical programs where different treatments are used with different populations, so it is difficult to isolate the factors that influence relapse. In addition, few researchers have done careful evaluations of patients when they are most likely to relapse, that is, after treatment has ended. Periodic follow-ups in groups are the only contacts with patients in most studies, so repeated, intensive assessments are needed. There would be great value in learning more about the nature and process of relapse.\n\nA metaphor that describes traditional thought on relapse is of a person existing perilously close to the edge of a cliff. The slightest disruption can precipitate a fall from which there is no return'. A person is always on the brink of relapse, ready to fall at any disturbance. There may be physiological, psychological, or social causes of the disturbance, but the outcome is just as final. The first slip creates momentum so that a complete relapse is certain.\n\nThis metaphor may be inadequate.. It does not explain why a relapse occurs under the same circumstances that the person managed before. An eating binge may precipitate relapse in a dieter, but such an individual has probably recovered from similar binges in the past. A smoker may relapse after being offered a cigarette, but there are cases where this same person refused the cigarette or prevented the lapse from becoming a relapse. Also, the metaphor is based on observations of people who have relapsed, not those who have not, therefore, successful recovery is seldom seen.\n\nInformation on natural history could address the question of whether the probability of relapse increases or decreases with time. If relapse occurs when treatment \"wears off,\" the probability should increase with time. If the metaphor used above is valid, the chance of relapse should increase with time simply because more disturbances could occur. One can speculate, however, that a person learns to cope effectively as time passes and that those who \"survive\" beyond the initial period are those who will succeed. To the extent withdrawal symptoms precipitate relapse, particularly in smoking and alcoholism, the likelihood of relapse should decrease as the body adapts to the absence of the addictive substance.\n\nIt is in this context that the concept of a \"safe\" point arises. This is a point in time before which relapse is likely and beyond which relapse is unlikely. In the work of Hunt et al. (1971) on heroin addiction, smoking, and alcoholism, relapse curves stabilized after the first three months. It is appealing to conclude that individuals who abstain for three months are likely to succeed thereafter, but more recent evidence does not support a specific safe point (Lichtenstein & Rodrigues, 1977;Wilson & Brownell, 1980). Defining such a point would have important conceptual and practical implications, so more study on this topic could pay high dividends. Interpreting relapse curves may be the first step.\n\nRelapse curves are one type of survival curve. As such, the figures must be interpreted with several facts in mind (Elandt-Johnson & Johnson, 1980;Marlatt & Gordon, 1985;Sutton, 1979). Group averages do not represent individuals. Madatt, Goldstein, and Gordon (1984) found that abstinence rates for smokers after quitting on the basis of a New Year's resolution were 21% both 4 and 12 months later, implying that relapse rates stabilize and show a safe point at 4 months. However, different individuals formed the 21% these two times; some persons moved from abstinence to relapse whereas equal numbers moved in the opposite direction. Second, the cumulative nature of the curves implies that a person who relapses will remain so; survival curves are negatively accelerating by their nature. Schachter (1982) noted that cure for many persons follows several relapses. Third, the probability of survival for the entire group increases with time because the persons at highest risk are most likely to leave the sample. Life table analyses have been designed to deal with these issues (Elandt-Johnson & Johnson, 1980). Therefore, it may be possible in future research to develop a time line for the relapse process and to determine whether there are \"safe\" points.\n\nSome information does exist on the natural history of the addictions. Vaillant's (1983) report on the longterm progress of 110 alcohol abusers, 71 of whom were \"alcohol dependent,\" shows the complexity of the issue. Vaillant's book, and an article by Vaillant and Milofsky (1982), showed the importance of cultural and ethnic factors in alcoholism. Many personal and environmental factors influenced the propensity to drink excessively. It was clear from these data that a lapse does not necessarily become a relapse and that this transition has many determinants. Schachter (1982) interviewed 161 persons from the Psychology Department at Columbia University and from a resort community. In their retrospective accounts, they reported much higher rates of success at dieting and smoking cessation than suggested by the literature. Almost all successes were achieved without professional aid. Although Schachter's methods have been questioned (Jeffery & Wing, 1983;Prochaska, 1983), he made several important points. He noted that cure rates are based on clinical samples and that self-quitters may differ from therapy-assisted quitters, a notion supported by Di-Clemente and Prochaska (1982). Second, he found that many of the successful quitters had made numerous attempts to change before finally succeeding. Marlatt andGordon (1980, 1985) have examined the natural history of the relapse itself. Beginning with a high-risk situation, their cognitive-behavioral model addresses the coping process (Figure 1). The absence of a coping response leads to decreased self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977a(Bandura, , 1977b)), then use of the substance, and then the cognitive phenomenon they label the \"abstinence violation effect.\" This phenomenon involves the loss of control that follows violation of self-imposed rules. The end result of this process is increased probability of relapse. Recent data from an analysis of relapse episodes in smokers showed a significant difference in attributions for slips between subjects who slipped (smoked at least 1 cigarette) and regained abstinence and those who relapsed (Goldstein, Gordon, & Marlatt, 1984). Persons who relapsed made more internal, characterological attributions for the slip. This model is useful in conceptualizing the relapse process from the point at which the person is in a highrisk situation. Marlatt and Gordon's (1985) model allows for multiple determinants of high-risk situations but emphasizes cognitive processes thereafter. Other factors of a physiological or environmental nature may also be important. Note. Reprinted from Relapse Prevention: Maintenance Strategies in Addictive Behavior Change (p. 38) by G. A.

Reprinted by permission.\n\nFor example, the use of nicotine or alcohol after a period of abstinence may create a physiological demand for additional use. An environmental example is that of a smoker whose lapse occurs in a social setting where others are smoking. The resulting cues may provoke further use. Grunberg and colleagues have found powerful effects of nicotine on the regulation of body weight and food preferences in both humans and animals (Grunberg, 1982;Grunberg & Bowen, 1985;G-runberg~ Bowen, Maycock, & Nespor, 1985;Grunberg, Bowen, & Morse, 1984). Stopping smoking can create physiological pressure to change food intake and gain weight. This in turn has psychological and environmental consequences that can precipitate relapse. Therefore, it is important to consider the interaction of individual, environmental, and physiological factors in all stages of the change process.\n\nThere is much to be learned about the natural history of relapse. More descriptive information is needed on lapses and their associations with relapse. This research is not easy because the work must be prospective and because qualitative and quantitative work must be combined. AS an example, Lichtenstein (1984)followed treated smokers at 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals with telephone calls. Relapses were preceded by slips for 41 subjects; 19 subjects reported slips but did not relapse. More information of this nature would be useful.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to divide the change process into stages (DiClemente & Prochaska, 1982;Horn, 1976;Marlatt & Gordon, 1985;Prochaska, 1979;Prochaska & DiClemente, 1982, 1983, 1984;Rosen & Shipley, 1983). There seems to be a convergence of opinion that at least three fundamental stages exist. Horn (1976) first proposed four stages of change in smoking cessation (a) contemplating change, (b) deciding to change, (c) short-term change, and (d) long-term change. This is similar to the three-stage models suggested by DiClemente and Proehaska (I982), Rosen and Shipley (1983), and Marlatt and Gordon (1985), which involve the decision and commitment to change, initial change, and maintenance of change.\n\nProchaska and DiClemente have done the most thorough work in this area by evaluating stage models of smoking cessation and therapy in general. Prochaska (1979) reviewed 300 therapy outcome studies and proposed five stages, three of which involved \"verbal processes\" and two \"behavioral processes.\" DiClemente and Prochaska (1982) used this model to compare smokers who quit on their own to those who used commercial programs. They proposed the three stages mentioned above and described six verbal and four behavioral processes within the stages. In their recent work, Proehaska andDiClemente (1983, 1984) suggested five stages: (a) precontemplation, (b) contemplation, (c) action, (d) maintenance, and (e) relapse.\n\nMore work is needed to test the utility of the various stage models. They are similar in many respects. Each has at least one stage where motivation and commitment are central, followed by initial change and then the maintenance of change, so we will use these three fundamental stages to organize the description of relapse prevention later in this article. Whichever stage model prevails, we feel that relapse must be considered in fight of the stages that precede it. This will draw attention to the early determinants of relapse and the importance of the many factors that influence long-term success.\n\nA stage model may also be helpful for relapse itself. A model might include the time prior to a lapse, the lapse itself, and the period in which the person does or does not relapse. The work of Lichtenstein, Antonuccio, and Rainwater (1977), Cummings et al. (1980), and Shiffman (1982, 1984) suggests the utility of such an approach.\n\nAn important conceptual advance has been the emphasis of Prochaska andDiClemente (1982, 1984) on a circular rather than linear model of change. Linear models have stages that occur in a specific sequence, with relapse occurring at the last stage. A circular model shows relapse leading back to an earlier stage from which an individual may make another attempt to change. Relapse can be viewed in a less negative light from this perspective, as an individual may acquire information or skills that may be helpful later. This is consistent with Schachter's (1982) notion that success for most individuals comes after several relapses. Taking this to the extreme, one could suggest that relapse is a necessary step on the path to success. We do not support this extreme , but we do feel that relapse may provide valuable experience and that persons who relapse should be instructed, accordingly.\n\nRelapse could provoke a variety of responses in the individual. It is generally assumed that these responses are negative, but this may not be true in all cases. This is an important issue because these responses may determine the likelihood of success in subsequent attempts to change.\n\nIt would appear at first glance that relapse has negative emotional effects. Disappointment, frustration, and self-condemnation are apparent in people who relaps e . Family and friends are unhappy and sometimes angry. Yet, learning may occur before or during the relapse, so some benefit may exist. One study tracked depression in subjects who lost weight and then regained it (Brownell & Stunkard,198 I). Depression scores dropped as weight declined, but returned halfway to baseline as half of the weight was regained. Although these subjects were not successful maintainers, the net change in mood was still positive.\n\nThere may also be physiological effects of relapse. When a person stops smoking, the body begins the healing process, and risk for premature death declines (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1983). Because there is a dose-response relationship between smoking and disease, bouts of abstinence may incur some benefit, so the smoker who relapses may be better off medically than one who never quit. This is highly speculative, but it does show that this issue deserves more attention.\n\nThe picture may be different in the weight loss area, where relapse may have detrimental metabolic and health effects. A recent study found that repeated cycles of weight loss and regain in animals was associated with increased metabolic efficiency (Brownell, Greenwood, Shrager, & Stellar, 1986). As a result, the animals lost weight at half the rate when they were put on a diet a second time even though intake was the same on both diets. When allowed to eat freely, the animals regained at three times the rate on the second diet than on the first diet. Dieting and relapse made subsequent dieting more difficult. Epidemiology studies with humans show positive effects of weight loss on blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose tol. erance, and so forth (Simopolous & Van Itallie, 1984). However, when an equal amount of weight is regained, the negative effects on blood pressure and cholesterol may be greater than the positive effects when the weight is lost (Ashley & Kannel, 1974).\n\nRelapse: Failure or incremental learning? We wonder whether repeated attempts to change followed by relapse increase or decrease the chance for later success. There is evidence that persons who have dieted many times have a poor prognosis (Jeffery et al., 1984;Jeffery, Snell, & Forster, 1985), although Dubbert and Wilson (1984) did not find this result. A relapse could be a failure that strengthens the person's view that the problem is beyond his or her best efforts. However, relapse may have positive consequences if the experience somehow prepares the individual for later success. This more optimistic view is consistent with Schachter's (1982) suggestion that multiple attempts occur before many people succeed. A person who relapses may be acquiring information about his or her weaknesses and may learn ways to prevent lapses in the future.\n\nThis view of incremental learning could be useful to both professionals and patients. If relapse can be a constructive experience, experimentation with programmed relapse might be warranted (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). This approach involves planning and executing a relapse that would not occur otherwise, to teach patients to recover with self-management techniques. This approach will be discussed in more detail below.\n\nAn area that has received little attention is the effect of patients who relapse on the professionals who treat them. Following patients through the emotional roller coaster of success and relapse is discouraging and can make professionals pessimistic with new patients. Whether this pessimism is justified depends on perspective. It is a failure viewed in the short term, but some long-term effect may occur. Most patients will make other attempts, and some will succeed.\n\nWe make several assumptions here. The first is that there are similarities in relapse across the addictive disorders (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). Our second assumption is that different processes govern initial change and maintenance (Bandura, 1977a). This assumption has been sub-stantiated by research on alcoholism (Cronkite & Moos, 1980;Marlatt & Gordon, 1985), smoking (Lichtenstein, 1982;Pomerleau, Adkins, & Pertschuk, 1978;Shiffman, 1982Shiffman, , 1984)), and obesity (Brownell, 1982;Dubbert & Wilson, 1984;Wilson, 1978). The third assumption is that the risk for relapse is determined by an interaction of individual, situational, and physiological factors,\n\nThe initial attempts to classify relapse situations were made by Marlatt (1978 ), Marlatt andGordon (1980), andCummings et al. (1980). The Cummings et al. analysis evaluated 311 initial relapse episodes in drinking, smoking, compulsive gambling, excessive eating, and heroin addiction. Several determinants emerged, which can be broadly grouped into individual (intrapersonal) and situational (environmental) categories. These two categories are supported by work on smoking (Mermelstein & Lichtenstein, 1983;Shiffman, 1982Shiffman, , 1984) ) and obesity (Dubbert & Wilson, 1984). We feel it important to add physiological variables, as their importance is becoming more clear (Best et al., in press;Brownell, 1982;Lichtenstein, 1982;Myers, 1978;Nathan & Wiens, 1983;Pomerleau & Pomerleau, 1984).\n\nNegative emotional states. Stress, depression, anxiety, and other emotional states are related to relapse. Cummings ct al. (1980) found that negative emotional states accounted for 30% of all relapses. Shiffman (1982Shiffman ( , 1984) ) evaluated reports of relapse in 264 ex-smokers who called a telephone hotline service (Stay Quit Line). Subjects were interviewed soon after the relapse, so reports were recent even if based only on self-report. Most of the subjects (71%) had negative affects preceding the relapse, with the most common mood state being anxiety, followed by anger or frustration, and depression (Shiffman, 1982). Ossip-Klein, Shapiro, and Stiggens (1984) have also used a telephone hotline to study relapse in smokers. Mermelstein, Cohen, and Lichtenstein (1983) found that 43% of relapses occur under stress. Pomerleau ct al. (1978) reported that those who smoke to reduce negative affect are at increased risk for relapse. A careful study of smokers by Abrams ct al. (1986) supported these notions by using physiological, behavioral, and self-report data.\n\nIn a study with smokers, Mermelstein and Lichtenstein (1983) studied both lapses (slips) and relapses. Lapses were more commonly associated with situational factors, whereas relapses occurred during negative emotional states or stress events. When the data from these studies with different addictive behaviors are combined, it is clear that negative emotional states greatly increase the chance of relapse. More specifically, negative moods may increase the chance that a lapse will become a relapse.\n\nInadequate motivation. It is surprising that so little work has been done on motivation and commitment. It would seem that all persons who set out to change are motivated, particularly those who enter professional programs. However, there are degrees of motivation, and it is common for a person to begin the change process in a burst of enthusiasm without appreciation for the long-term effort involved. In other cases, the motivationmay be more external than internal, when social pressure forces a Symbolic if not.real attempt to change:\n\nThere' are three relevant aspects of the motivation issue. The first is the need to evaluate motivation so~th~ high-risk subjects~can be detected. To our knowledge, this has not been done in the addictions area..Second, screening for'motivation is important if treatment should be targeted at those with a chance for success. Third, methods may be available for increasing motivation, to improve a person's \"readiness-\": for change (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985;Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984)~ The second and third issues have implications for treatment, as we will diScuss.\n\nResponse to treatment. There is some evidence tha~ initial responses to treatment predict later success. Weight lo~s in the first weeks of treatment has been related to success (Foreyt ct al., 1982;Graham, Taylor, Hovell & Siegel, 1983; Jeffery, W i r ~& Stunkard, 1978). Pomerleau et at. (1978) found that early compliance (self-monitoring) was related to Oositive outcome:in smokers, and Glasgow, Sharer, and O'Neill (1981) found that self-reported compliance was related to success in self-quitters. Inability to stop smoking on the assigned target date (usually midway in treatment) is a poor prognostic sign (Liehtenstein, 1982).\n\nOne of us (KDB) has observed informally a para, doxical relationship between early program adherence and outcome in persons on very low, calorie diets, a rigid program that is nearly a complete fast (Wadden, Stunkard, & Brownell, 1983). Patients areasked not to \"cheat'~ on the dict,. Those who struggle:with adherence to amod, crate degree seem to do better in the long run than those whoadhere perfectly from the outset. The perfect~adherers seem to have trouble recovering from the inevitable slip that the early perfection merely postpones. It is possible that highmotivation initially ~can mask strongpressures to relapse, but once internal and external pressures wear away restraint, a lapse is likely to become a relapse. Patients.who struggle to a moderate degree wi~ adherence throughout a program may do well later becansethey can cope with temporary setbacks.\n\nCoping skills. Shiffman (1984) found that both cognitive and behavioral coping responses were associated with success in smokers calling the hotline mentioned earlier. The most common behavioral responses were consumption of food and drink and other distracting activities. Several aspeets.of\"self-talk\" were the most common cognitive responses. Shiffrnan found positive asso~ eiations between outcome and seven behavioral and five cognitive methods of coping, but the various coping strategies were about equally effective.\n\nThereis evidence in the weight control area showing the utility of a cognitive \"threshold\" for weight regaitl in persons who have lost weight (Brownell, 1984a;Wilson, 1985). Stuart and Guire (1978) examined successful maintainers in Weight Watchers and found them likely to have a personal regain threshold of three pounds or less before they instituted self-correcting actions., Bandura andSimon (1977) found that subjects who used proximal rather than distal goals were most successful at maintenance. One aspect of the proximal goals was a weight increase threshold.\n\nAnother factor that may relate to long-term success are the coping skills associated with self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977b). Self-efficacy is aperson's belief that he or she can respond effectively to a situationby using available skills. This concept is at the root of the relapse prevention approach of Marlatt and Gordon (1985) and has been applied to alcoholism (Chancy, O'Leary, & Marlatt, 1978), smoking, (Brown, Lichtenstein, McIntyre, & Harrington-Kostur, 1984;Hall, Rngg, Tunstall, & Jones, 1984;Killen, Maccoby, & Taylor, 1984), and obesity~ (Perri, McAdoo, Spevak, & Newlin, 1984;Perri, Shapiro, Ludwig, Twentyman, & McAdoo, 1984). Several studies have found measures of self-efficacy associated with positive outcome (Collctti, Supnick, & Payne, 1985;Condiotti & Lichtenstein, 1981;Killen et al., 1984;Supnick & Colletti, 1984).\n\nPhysiological factors may,be a central determinant of relapse. Genetic factors appear to be important for alcoholism, smoking, and obesity (MeClearn, 1981;Pomerleau, 1984;Schuckitt, 1981;Stunkard et al., 1986). In the cases of alcoholism and smoking, other physiological influences are related to withdrawal, to the reinforcing properties of alcohol or nicotine, or to conditioned associations between specific cues and physiological responses (Abrams & Wilson, 1986;Hodgson, 1980;Ludwig, Wilder, & Stark, 1974;Pomefleau, 1984;Pomerleau & Pomerleau, 1984;Poulos, Hinson, & Siegel, 1981;Sicgel, 1979). A patient's use of terms like urge and craving mayreflect some of these pressures. Siegel (1979) and others (Ludwig et al., 1974) proposed that alcoholics show conditioned reactions to environmental, emotional, and physiological stimuli that have been associated with previous withdrawal. Conditioned compensatory responses are thought to elicit craving for alcohol. Poulos et al. (1981) suggested that treatment must deal with extinction o f these cues.\n\nDegree of physical dependency must also be considered in alcohol abuse (Hodgson, 1980;Marlatt & Gordon, 1985;Miller & Hester, 1980). Several studies by Hodgson and colleagues found that alcoholics with serious physical dependency have stronger cravings and respond differently than:~mildiy dependent subjects to ingestion of alcohol (Hodgson, Rankin, & Stockwell, 1979;Stockwell, Hodgson, Rankin, & Taylor, 1982). Dependency may also influence the goals and course of ~eatment. Chronic alcohol use is associated with several cognitive impairments, so skill acquisition may be more difficult (Wilkinson & Sanchcz-Craig, 1981). If controlled drinking is a viable goal of treatment, it would be so for only a subgroup of problem drinkers: abstinence is the clear goal for severe alcohol dependence (Marlatt, 1983;Miller & Hcster, 1980;Nathan & Goldman, 1979).\n\nSimilarly powerful factors may be associated with smoking (Abrams & Wilson, 1986;Pomerleau & Pom-erleau, 1984). A review by McMorrow and Foxx (1983) showed how changes in smoking behavior accompany changes in blood nicotine level. Pomerleau (1984) found that nicotine stimulates release of beta-endorphin, increases heart rate, and possibly improves memory and attention; therefore he characterized nicotine as a powerful chemical reinforcer. Furthermore, the degree of physical dependence has implications for treatment. Two studies found that smokers who are highly dependent on nicotine benefit most from treatment with nicotine chewing gum (Fagerstrom, 1982;Hall et al., 1985).\n\nDifferent but also influential physiological factors may be involved in obesity. Food does not seem addictive in the manner of cigarettes and alcohol, yet the physical pressures to regain lost weight may be extremely powerful (Bennett & Gurin, 1982;Bray, 1976;Brownell, 1982;Wooley, Wooley, & Dyrenforth, 1979). Such pressures could involve the lipid repletion of fat cells and alterations of several factors including body composition, metabolic rate, thermogenic response to food, and enzyme activity, each of which may be related to a body weight \"set point\" in which the organism defends a biological ideal against fluctuations, including weight loss.\n\nGiven these important physiological factors, it may be informative to examine the subjective impressions of their likely manifestations, namely cravings, urges, and withdrawal. Studies in these areas have shown inconsistent findings. The Cummings et al. (1980) study found that \"urges and temptations\" were associated with only 6% of the relapse situations and that \"negative physical states\" were associated with only 7% of the situations. Mermelstein et al. (1983) found that craving was the major factor in only 9% of relapses in smokers. In contrast, Shiffman (1982) found that approximately half of the relapse situations in smokers occurred in conjunction with withdrawal symptoms. Even though Shiffman interpreted this result as showing that withdrawal symptoms are less important than expected, they would appear from his data to be powerful precipitating events.\n\nThere is compelling evidence that environmental and social factors, including specific external contingencies, play an important role in the addictive disorders. These can be interactions among individuals (social support), environmental or setting events, or programs that manipulate contingencies.\n\nSocial support. Social factors are important determinants of susceptibility to diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and psychiatric disturbances (Cobb, 1976;Cohen & Syme, 1985). They are important in a person's ability to make stressful decisions and to adhere to a therapeutic program (Janis, 1983) and have been related to success in the addictive disorders (Best, 1980;Colletti & Brownell, 1982;Mops & Finney, 1983).\n\nResearch in this area has taken two forms: the evaluation of social support as a predictor variable and the modification of social factors to boost treatment effectiveness. Treatment will be discussed below. The work with predicting success with social variables has been fruitful.\n\nSupport from family and friends is one of the few variables that is associated with long-term success at weight reduction (Brownell, 1984a;Miller & Sims, 198 l;Wilson, 1985). Studies on smoking suggest the same association (Coppotelli & Orleans, 1985;Mermelstein et al., 1983). Whether a spouse is a smoker and is attempting to quit relates negatively to ability to stop smoking (Lichtenstein, 1982). Perceived general support (not specific to quitting) also relates to the maintenance of nonsmoking or reduced smoking (Mermelstein et al., 1983). Mops and Finney (1983) summarized studies in the alcohol area showing that marital and family cohesion enhance response to treatment in follow-ups of as long as two years.\n\nIn their review of the relapse area, Madatt and Gordon (1985) and Cummings et al. (1980) pointed to the importance of social factors across areas of the addictions.\n\nInterpersonal conflict can be viewed as the converse of social support, and studies have shown that it is a prognostic sign for relapse. In the study by Cummings et al. (1980), nearly half(48%) of the relapse episodes occurred in association with interpersonal determinants, with one third of these coming from conflict. It appears, therefore, that stressful interpersonal relationships can hinder and that supportive relationships can help. This emerges from the literature despite inconsistent methods of measuring support. The supportive person may be helpful not only in establishing a benevolent environment but by assisting with specific behavior changes (Coppotelli & Orleans, 1985). One challenge is to evaluate the nature of supportive behaviors and the reasons certain behaviors support some persons and not others.\n\nOne possible avenue for social support is from commercial or self-help groups. Such groups abound and exist in all areas of the addictions (Gartner & Reissman, 1984). Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, Weight Watchers, Overeaters Anonymous, and SmokEnders deliver programs to millions and reach many more people than do professional programs. Their potential is tremendous, both to teach skills and provide social support. Is this potential realized?\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate many self-help and commercial groups. They vary greatly in cost, approach, size, geographic distribution, and so forth. Different chapters of the same group sometimes differ as much with one another as they do with outside groups. It is clear that many people benefit from these approaches, both in terms of initial results and maintenance (Gartner & Reissman, 1984). Guidelines are needed to refine the active components of these groups and to determine which people are best suited for self-help approaches.\n\nEnvironmental stimuli and external contingencies. Events in the environment can set the stage for relapse. These typically take the form of social pressure from others, exposure to the undesirable behavior during social events like parties, and cues from situations formerly associated with the addictive behavior. Shiffman (1982) found that social events preceded one fourth of the relapse crises of smokers and that activities previously associated with smoking (eating and drinking) were frequent antecedent events. Marlatt andGordon (1980, 1985) also found these to be important factors. Mermelstein and Lichtenstein (1983) reported that lapses were most likely under social cues, a social celebration, or the consumption of alcohol. 9 Numerous programs have shown that contingency management and the systematic manipulation of environmental factors can enhance motivation. Programs using financial incentives have been useful in promoting weight loss in both adults and children (Epstein, Wing, Koeske, Andrasik, & Ossip, 1981;Jeffery, Forster, & Snell, 1985;Jeffery, Gerber, Rosenthal, & Lindquist, 1983). Reward systems have also been used with some success in smoking (Lichtenstein, 1982). The careful work of Bigelow, Stitzer, and colleagues has shown powerful effects of contingency management on drug abuse, alcohol intake, and smoking (Bigelow, Stitzer, Griifiths, & Liebson, 1981;Stitzer & Bigelow, 1984). Such work presents specific components of treatment that may help present relapse.\n\nExternal contingencies have most often been ma. nipulated in the alcohol area. Hunt and Azrin (1973) used an intensive community reinforcement program in which family, social, and vocational reinforcers were altered systematically. Among the treatment components were marital and family counseling, skills training, assistance with daffy needs such as obtaining adriver's license, a social club for clients, and contingency contracting. Compared to control clients, those who received this program remained more sober, had better employment records, and showed several other tangible indications of improvement. Azrin (1976) then modified this approach using Antabuse and an early warning system for relapse. Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) are another example of environmental contingencies influencing alcoholics (Nathan, 1983(Nathan, , 1984)). Participating in treatment and remaining sober may be a condition for employment. Some programs for impaired professionals require treatment for continued practice.\n\nThe risk for lapse and relapse is determined by an interaction of individual, environmental, and physiological factors. This is an area in which the distinction of lapse and relapse is particularly useful, as there may be different determinants and antecedents in each case. Mermelstein and Lichtenstein (1983) showed in their findings that lapses tended to be associated with social factors and that relapses were associated with individual factors (negative emotional states :and stress events). Shiffman (1982) theorized that a situational analysis could predict increased risk for relapse but that coping skills would determine whether this risk becomes reality. Other theorists have pointed t o powerful physiological cravings to help explain both addiction and relapse (Abrams & Wilson, 1986;Brownell, 1982;Pomerleau & Pomerlean, 1984).\n\nIf lapse and relapse are viewed on a time line, individual, environmental, and physiological factors may exert their influence at different stages. Physiological factors may promote lapse and may set into play a series of reactions to an initial lapse that may increase the likelihood of relapse. The environmental and social factors can provide the setting, stimuli, and encouragement from others to lapse. As the choice point for the lapse approaches, coping skills can prevent the lapse. Whether the lapse recurs and ends in relapse probably results from. a complex interaction of these factors, each of which may assume more or less importance depending on the individual and his or her environment.\n\nTraditional attempts to facilitate long-term maintenance fall in three categories. The first has been to extend treatment by adding \"booster\" sessions. As the name implies, patients are to be \"immunized\" against pressures to relapse with the initial treatment, and periodic boosters are needed to maintain the protection. Booster sessions have been used most 9 in the obesity and smoking areas and have been consistently ineffective (Lichtenstein, 1982;Wilson, 1985).\n\nA second approach has been to add more components to the treatment package, the most common being relaxation, contingency management, and assertion training. This has not been effective. Marlatt and Gordon (1985) stated, \"All of this is heavy artillery--yet all it may do is project the cannonball a little bit further before it finally hits the ground\" (p. 45). Adding new components to a package may help, but not enough to prevent relapse.\n\nAdding components may also complicate a package and compromise the results of otherwise effective treatment. This result would be predicted from the literature showing that compliance is related inversely to the complexity of a regimen (Epstein & Cluss, 1982;Sackett & Haynes, 1976). There is some support for this in two obesity studies in which the combination of an appetite suppressant with behavior therapy was no more effective (Craighead, 1984) or even less effective (Craighead, Stunkard, & O'Brien, 1981) than behavior therapy alone.\n\nA third traditional approach to preventing relapse is to adopt a model of lifelong treatment. This model is inherent in Alcoholics Anonymous, where participants are always \"recovering\" and never \"recovered.\" This same philosophy applies to Overeaters Anonymous and to some extent to the lifetime membership offered by Weight Watchers. It may be true that chronic disorders require chronic treatment. According to our model of relapse prevention, lifelong treatment has both advantages and disadvantages. On the negative side, imparting the message that a person can control but not cure an addiction may establish a climate in which lapses create strong expectations of relapse. On the positive side, lifelong programs do not have the disadvantage of standard programs in which intensive treatment is followed by no treatment, the point at which relapse may be likely. These approaches must be considered viable, if for no other reason than that millions of persons have profited from their use. Program evaluation studies are difficult because of their longterm nature and the problems in doing research on commercial and self-help groups. It is, however, a pressing need for the field.\n\nWe propose that the prevention of lapse and relapse correspond to the stages of their natural history. The approach described below is based on the three stages described earlier: motivation and commitment, initial change, and maintenance. We attempt to integrate what is known about individual, environmental, and physiological determinants of lapse and relapse.\n\nAt this stage, individuals commit themselves to change and make the first steps toward the modification of maladaptive behavior. There are two aspects of this process that are pertinent to relapse. One is the development of methods to enhance motivation. The second is screening to identify an individual's likelihood of success. Central to both is the ability to assess motivation and other factors related to prognosis. This is a pressing area for research, as good methods do not exist.\n\nEnhancing motivation. Many candidates for programs are motivated, but many are not. A major challenge is to enhance motivation when it is low in order to maximize readiness for change. Little systematic work has been done in this area. Education about the dangers of the addiction, support from others, therapist characteristics, and feedback about physical status are among the possible methods for increasing motivation, but even these factors have not been studied in detail. The field stands to profit from research targeted at this initial stage in the change process.\n\nOne possible approach for enhancing motivation is to use contingency-management procedures. Monetary incentives have been studied most thoroughly; the depositrefund system is most common. In this system, patients are required to deposit money, sometimes on a sliding scale, that is then returned for attendance at meetings or for a specified behavior change (Hagen, Foreyt, & Durham, 1976;Jeffery et al., 1983). This approach reduces attrition (Hagen et al., 1976;Wilson & Brownell, 1980), but it is not clear whether it enhances motivation prior to treatment. The deposit-refund may simply deter people who are not motivated from entering treatment, which gives it possible utility as a screening device.\n\nIt is surprising that so little has been done on methods for enhancing motivation. The work of Prochaska and his colleagues is a move in this direction (Prochaska, 1979;Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983, 1984). These studies have helped define stages of change. The knowledge from these and similar studies may suggest methods for enhancing motivation in the early stages. Such methods could have wide application in public health programs where the goal is to encourage attempts to change.\n\nOne important aspect of this early stage is preparing the individual for the possibility of lapse and even relapse (Lando, 1981). A fine line must be drawn between preparing a person for mistakes and giving \"permission\" for mistakes to occur by inferring that they are inevitable. Two metaphors may be useful in this context. One is of a fire drill (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). A person must practice to escape a fire even though fires are rare. The second metaphor is of a forest ranger whose dual tasks are to prevent and contain fires (Brownell, 1985). The best course is to prevent fires, but when they do occur, one must move swiftly before the fire consumes the entire forest.\n\nScreening to determine prognosis. Screening prior to a program may have two potential benefits. First, screening may help match individuals to programs. Second, screening may focus professional efforts on those most likely to succeed.\n\nMany potential remedies are available for the addictions. They range from no-cost efforts at self-change to expensive commercial and clinical programs. In between these extremes lie community programs, the media, self-help books, self-help groups, advice from a health care provider, and many others. Each approach works for some people. Screening could be valuable if individuals could be matched to the approach with the greatest impact at lowest cost. Developing criteria for this matching is a major need for the field.\n\nThe second use of screening is to make use of predictions of who will do well and who will not. The primary implication of the search for predictors is that persons who are likely to do poorly can be identified and can receive special treatment. This idea is appealing but is not yet practical. This approach assumes that there is something beyond standard treatment. In clinical programs, standard treatment is the most intensive and effective treatment known, so what else is to be done? In less intensive approaches, say self-help groups or community programs, referral to a more intensive approach may be the answer. However, there are several other tacit assumptions with this approach. One is that such persons will succeed if only the right procedures are used. This assumes the variance in outcome rests with the program rather than with the individual, which perpetuates the medical model of disease and cure. The other is that the cost of such efforts is justified.\n\nAnother perspective on screening would shift the focus from those at greatest risk for failure to those with greatest chance for success. Screening might be used to target a program to those most likely to benefit and to prevent the negative consequences of failure for those at high risk, assuming that the consequences of relapse are more negative than positive. The rationale for this has been discussed previously in the weight loss area (Brownell, 1984b). One reason is that failure, or the more likely occurrence of initial success followed by relapse, may add to a legacy of inadequacy and demoralize the patient. Second, the initial success followed by relapse may have negative physiological consequences, particularly for dieters. Third, the failure may convince the person that the problem is intractable, which may decrease the chance that treatment will be pursued later when motivation is higher. Fourth, if treatment is delivered in groups, \"negative contagion\" can occur when patients who are not doing well discourage those who are. Fifth, the morale of professionals suffers when a patient fails. Sixth, working with patients who are likely to fail leaves fewer resources for those who may succeed.\n\nThe object would be to screen for individual, environmental, or physiological factors that cannot be remedied easily. One factor is motivation. It is difficult to motivate a person who does not have a strong commitment to change. There are instances of programs motivating groups of people, say in a worksite or community (Brownell, Cohen, Stunkard, Felix, & Cooley, 1984;Pechacek, Mittelmark, Jeffery, Loken, & Luepker, 1985), but reliable methods for motivating individuals have not been developed. Another factor relates to a person's skills. Some skills deficits may be difficult to overcome.\n\nPhysiological factors may be among the most important objects of screening. Our earlier discussion raised some of the possible variables to be measured, including physical dependency, metabolic factors, withdrawal, and genetic loading. It is clear, therefore, that screening will be a multifaceted activity that will require assessment of many variables.\n\nThe concept of screening is easier to support in principle than to apply in practice. Its strength lies in the ability to separate false positives from false negatives. Using no screening increases false positives, that is, people who will eventually fail are permitted into a program. A screening procedure can produce false negatives (persons who would succeed are screened out unfairly). It is important to consider these along with the associated ethical issues (which will be discussed).\n\nT~o methods for screening. Little attention has been given to screening, so we can offer only preliminary ideas. One is a behavioral test of motivation, and the other is the use of predictor variables. The next few years will probably offer physiological variables for screening, but only the tentative suggestions made above are possible currently.\n\nThere are several possibilities for behavioral tests of motivation. The deposit-refund system has been effective in reducing attrition in obesity programs (Hagen et al., 1976;Wilson & Brownell, 1980) and has been used in smoking programs as well (Lichtenstein, 1982). This system is usually conceptualized as a means for sustaining motivation during a program, but it may also serve to screen out people with low levels of motivation before a program. Another behavioral test is to institute a \"screening phase\" prior to treatment. Patients must meet established criteria prior to entrance to the program. One of us (KDB) uses ibis in a weight control program by requiring patients to lose one pound per week for two weeks and to complete self-monitoring diaries. These criteria, combined with the deposit-refund system, are not difficult to meet for most patients, but individuals who are not motivated may not join a program where such a commitment is necessary. These are just examples of behavioral tests for motivation. More research may identify better methods.\n\nThe second (even less precise) method for screening is to use some combination of predictor variables to identify subjects at high risk for relapse. Marlatt et al. 0984) found that a motivational rating of desire to quit distinguished individuals who could not stop smoking for even aday from those who could quit for longer periods. As our discussion above shows, identifying predictors of relapse is not suffcienfly advanced to warrant screening. With more research, however, this may be possible.\n\nThis discussion pertains to clinical programs where treatment is intensive and costly. Large-scale programs, say in work sites or communities, may be inexpensive, so the aim shifts from having a strong impact on small groups to spreading lesser impact over large numbers (Brownell, 1986;Davis, Faust, & Ordenttich, 1984;Stunkard, 1986). In this case, the cost of screening may not be warranted.\n\nThe ethics of screening. Screening used in this fashion raises complex ethical issues. The decision of who can enter a program would no longer be based on who registers first or who can pay the fee, but there would be a conscious effort to deliver treatment to individuals with specific characteristics. This affords the opportunity for treatment to some and denies it to others. Although such an approach has not been studied, it is likely that certain subgroups of the population would fall disproportionately into the \"nonmotivated\" category. These subgroups might be characterized by sex, race, ,religion, or ethnic background, all groups that Western culture protects against discrimination.\n\nWhether such screening can be justified ethically may depend on many factors. One is the ability to help those at high risk. In the absence of proven technology for this purpose, does screening become more important? Another issue is cost. Is the extra cost of aiding a high-risk person justifiable? Some extra cost may be justified, but how much? What allocation of these resources will have the greatest impact on society, or should society be the primary concern? A third factor will be the sensitivity and specificity of screening procedures. A screening that produces few false negatives may be warranted if the social, psychological, and health costs of false positives are high, but how many false negatives can be tolerated?\n\nThese questions are too complex to address in detail here. We do feel that screening and identification of those with high and low chances for success is an issue of major importance. Who receives treatment is not currently determined by a systematic examination of the issues. It may happen in a systematic way, but for reasons that we do not understand and that may not be rational. Avoiding the questions only sidesteps the ethical issues but does not make the process of delivering treatment more ethical. We hope more research will be done in this area.\n\nThis stage of treatment is the intensive period that lies between screening and the maintenance phase. This pe-riod may be several weeks in smoking programs and three to six months in alcohol and obesity programs. This may not be the time for greatest risk of relapse, because patients are generally motivated and are gratified with their changes. However, high-risk situations do occur; therefore, this time is ideal for the acquisition and practice of skills specific to relapse (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). Some of these have been described in detail elsewhere (Marlatt & Gordon, 1980, 1985), so the basic rationale for the use and timing of the procedures will be given here.\n\nThe choice of specific treatment procedures is important, as is the timing of their use. The tendency is to squeeze all components into the initial treatment period and to use maintenance to review material presented earlier. This can burden the subject early in a programand may focus on skills when the skills are not required. Therefore, the right mixture of relapse prevention strategies in both initial treatment and maintenance may be one key to positive outcome.\n\nWe suggest three areas to be covered in initial treatment (a) decision making, (b) cognitive restructuring, and (c) coping skills. These are the procedures aimed specifically at the prevention of lapse and relapse and are to be done in addition to the techniques specific to the treatment of smoking, alcoholism, or obesity. They emerge from our conceptual approach described earlier and from existing information on predictors of relapse and the success of relapse prevention programs. A fourth area, cue elimination, has preliminary support in both theory and practice and may become more important as research progresses.\n\nThe focus on these three areas does not imply that they form the sole source of treatment. We do feel that specific techniques aimed at relapse are desirable in all stages of the change process and that relapse prevention techniques may aid any treatment program. For example, treatment for a dieter might consist of a habit change program of behavior modification, a supplemented fast, or even surgery. An alcoholic may receive Antabuse, may attend Alcoholics Anonymous, or may receive a skills training program. In each case, specific approaches can be applied to the lapse and relapse processes and may improve the prognosis for long-term change.\n\nAdditional areas will undoubtedly be added to these three as knowledge on relapse expands. We do not wish to imply that these are the only targets for relapse prevention or even that they will be consistently effective.\n\nThese are what the literature permits us to propose. Contingency management will probably be added to the list soon, as studies begin to target these techniques to relapse. Physiological factors may also emerge as important targets, but specific physiological interventions aimed at relapse are not evident from current knowledge. The number of studies on relapse is increasing rapidly. Our hope is that these will suggest refinement of the areas we suggest and will identify new areas for emphasis.\n\nThe first of the three areas involves decision-making skills. These prepare a person for analyzing the individual and environmental determinants of relapse. This analysis allows the person to decide which coping skills should be summoned for dealing with a particular situation. Cognitive restructuring is also central to this approach, as it teaches individuals to interpret events, attitudes, and feelings in a rational way and to respond constructively to crises. Such a scheme for analyzing the lapse and relapse sequence and of specifying methods of decision making, coping, and cognitive restructuring is shown in Figure 2. This presents examples of how an individual would use the framework described here to prepare for high-risk situations.\n\nCue extinction is receiving more attention as a possible means of preventing lapse and relapse. Based on the theoretical work of Siegel (1979) and others (Ludwig et al., 1974), there has been increasing emphasis on extinguishing the associations between cues and cravings (Abrams & Wilson, 1986). There may be individual, environmental, or physiological associations with substance use, and their extinction may be particularly important early in the change process when withdrawal is an issue. This is an area of potential importance, so more research is needed to test the theory and to develop clinical applications.\n\nResearch is needed to refine the techniques within these categories and to determine whether these categories are most appropriate for emphasis during initial behavior change. Shiffman's (1984) study of relapse in smokers is helpful in this regard, as he discovered that a combination of cognitive and behavioral coping skills was associated with maintenance.\n\nMost programs include some treatment during the maintenance phase, but this period has been virtually ignored as a point of intervention. With the exception of booster sessions, which are a reiteration of earlier material, few studies have used the maintenance phase as the time for targeting the lapse and relapse process. This is unfortunate, as clinical judgment would dictate emphasis in just this period. There are three areas of intervention that may be appropriate for the maintenance phase: (a) continued monitoring, (b) social support, and (c) general lifestyle change. Again, more areas may emerge as research continues, but these three are suggested by existing research.\n\nIt is widely believed that long-term vigilance, either via some form of self-evaluation or contact with a professional, is important in the therapeutic process. It is our impression that individuals profit from monitoring that extends beyond initial treatment. Treatment studies suggest that maintenance improves as contacts with professionals increase during follow-up, both in smoking (Colletti & Supnick, 1980) and obesity (Perri, McAdoo et al., 1984;Perri, Shapiro et al., 1984). This must be reconciled, however, with the general ineffectiveness of booster sessions. In addition, this raises the issue of when treatment ends and maintenance begins. Additional contacts may simply extend treatment and delay relapse rather than prevent it in any fundamental way. Whether these contacts Note.

Reprinted by permission. The boxes represent the stages in the process and the circles represent examples of interventions targeted at each stage.\n\nactually influence relapse may depend on the nature of the contact and the type of material presented. Marlatt and Gordon (1985) proposed social support as a component of relapse prevention. Social support is a predictor of long-term success, but attempts to intervene in the social environment have produced inconsistent results (Brownell, 1982;Brownell, Heckerman, Westlake, Hayes, & Monti, 1978;Lichtenstein, 1982). We believe that social factors are crucial in the behavior change process (Cohen & Syme, 1985) but that variations in social relationships make it unlikely that any single approach will work consistently. For instance, attempts to enlist the aid of a spouse may have positive effects in some marriages and negative effects in others. It is not surprising that parametric studies with groups show no effects for such programs. This is also an area where developmental work is needed so that the potential of social support can be exploited.\n\nGeneral life-style change may also be helpful (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). The theory is that a source of gratifi-cation can be substituted for the absence of the addictive disorder. This notion is consistent with clinical experience, but little research has been done. Likely candidates are relaxation training, meditation, and exercise. Of these, exercise has several intriguing possibilities, as we will dis-CUSS.\n\nA controversial but thus far ineffective approach to maintenance is programmed lapse. This approach involves a planned lapse in a therapeutic setting and might include an eating binge for a dieter, smoking for an exsmoker, or drinking for a problem drinker. This would be done only after the person has received extensive instruction in the cognitive and behavioral coping skills mentioned above. The purpose is to have the inevitable lapse occur under supervision and to demonstrate that self-management skills can be used to prevent the lapse from becoming a relapse. It may also be a useful paradoxical technique; because the therapist controls the lapse, perceptions about lack of control may change.\n\nCooney and colleagues tested this approach with smokers (Cooney & Kopel, 1980;Cooney, Kopel, & McKeon, 1982). After 5 weeks of cessation, subjects smoked one cigarette in a controlled session. Most were surprised by how unpleasant the cigarette was and were confident they would not smoke later. These subjects had greater self-efficacy ratings than subjects receiving only the cessation program, but there were no differences in abstinence rates at a 6-month follow-up. In fact, there was a trend for programmed lapse subjects to relapse earlier. This approach must be tested further before clinical use. The potential for harm is great, as the very cognitive patterns the procedure is designed to counter may promote uncontrolled relapse. Physiological factors may also create pressure to relapse. In addition, the studies with smokers by Cooney and colleagues did not produce favorable results. It might be a mistake, however, to dismiss the use of programmed lapse without more thorough evaluation.\n\nA special role for exercise? The wonders of exercise have been touted to the point of provoking a backlash, but there may be a special role for physical activity in the addictive disorders. Exercise has a natural role in the weight control field, but there is increasing evidence that its generalized effects may also benefit patients in the smoking and alcoholism areas.\n\nExercise is emerging as one of the most important components of treatment in the weight control area (Brownell & Stunkard, 1980;Thompson, Jarvie, Lahey, & Cureton, 1982). It is one of the few factors correlated with long-term success (Cohen, Gelfand, Dodd, Jensen, & Turner, 1980;Graham et at., 1983;Katahan, Pleas, Thackery, & Wallston, 1982;Miller & Sims, 1981;Stuart & Guire, 1978). Studies in which exercise is an independent variable show improved maintenance of weight loss (Dahlkoetter, Callahan, & Linton, 1979;Harris & Hallbauer, 1973;Stalonas, Johnson, & Christ, 1978).\n\nThree studies suggest the benefits of exercise for smokers. Koplan, Powell, Sikes, Shirley, and Campbell (1982) sent questionnaires to 2,500 runners one year after they completed the l0 km Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta. Fully 81% of men and 75% of women who smoked cigarettes when they started running had stopped smoking after beginning. Giving up smoking was significantly more common among current runners than among those who had stopped running in the year following the race. In the Ontario Exercise-Heart Collaborative Study, 733 men recovering from myocardial infarction were followed for three years of an exercise program (Oldridge et al., 1983). For the 46.5% of the men who dropped out, the two strongest predictors of dropout were smoking and blue collar occupation. Shiffman (1984) found that exercise was used as a coping response in smokers who avoided relapse.\n\nThe only study in the alcoholism area also produced encouraging findings. Murphy, Marlatt, and Pagano (in press) trained heavy drinkers in aerobic exercise (running) or meditation. The running condition was associated with the most significant reductions in drinking rates during both treatment and follow-up.\n\nIf exercise can be used to prevent relapse, there are several possible mechanisms. It may be a general lifestyle activity that brings gratification, and possibly a positive addiction (Glasser, 1976), to the person who needs adaptive substitutes for the undesirable behavior (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). It may influence self-concept or selfefficacy, which may generalize to the behavior change program. It may provide some stimulus control by removing the person to a safe setting or may provide a peer group that supports healthy behavior. There may also be physiological effects that influence the appetitive processes directly or that may change psychological functioning. These possibilities deserve further exploration.\n\nThe use of relapse prevention programs is in its infancy, but many of the existing studies show positive effects. In addition to the contingency management studies mentioned above, which showed positive long-term results, several studies have used variations of the model proposed by Marlatt and Gordon (1980). Chaney et at. (1978) first used some elements of relapse prevention with alcoholics. They found no differences in absolute abstinence between the relapse prevention group and two control groups, but there were significant differences in favor of the relapse prevention group for duration and severity of drinking. Hall et at. (1984) used a skills training program for relapse prevention in smokers. Subjects receiving this training had greater abstinence rates than subjects who did not at 6 and 52 weeks from the beginning of the study. The program had its greatest effect on light smokers. Killen et al. (1984) also found positive effects for relapse prevention with smokers. Brown et at. (1984) used a cognitive relapse prevention program with smokers and found promising results in a pilot study but no effects in a controlled study. Supnick and Colletti (1984) tested the Marlatt and Gordon (1980) model with smokers and found that a problem-solving component was associated with lower relapse rates but that a relapse-coping component was not.\n\nSeveral studies have tested relapse prevention with dieters. Abrams and Follick (1983) found improved longterm results by adding a relapse prevention package to a behavioral program administered in a work setting. Sternberg (1985) found similar results in a clinical setting, but using basically the same approach, Collins, Rothblum, and Wilson (in press) found no effect. Two studies, one by Perri, McAdoo et al. (1984) and another by Perri, Shapiro et at. (1984), found positive effects for a relapse prevention package. Perri, McAdoo et al. (1984) found better long-term results for a multicomponent maintenance program than for a control approach using booster sessions. Perri, Shapiro et al. (1984) then tested various approaches to maintenance and found that relapse prevention boosted long-term results but only when mail and telephone contacts were added.\n\nIt is too early to draw specific conclusions about these studies. They vary widely in populations and in the procedures labeled \"relapse prevention.\" Most are mod- eled conceptually after Marlatt andGordon's (1980, 1985) principles, but the application in treatment is different from setting to setting. Some studies can be faulted for small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, modest treat-ment effects, and so forth, so it is not surprising t o find mixed results. The studies with results in favor 0t'relapse prevention, however, outnumber those with negative results, so at the very least, more vigorous testing of the model is warranted.\n\nWe hope researchers will continue to test a wide range of relapse prevention procedures rather than risk the problem seen in behavioral research for obesity, in which a \"package\" was developed and compared to other approaches. Its statistical superiority was more important than clinical realities, and the package became standard fare (Brownell, 1982;Foreyt et al., 1982;Wilson, 1978). Instead of searching for better approaches, investigators tested small refinements in the package. We should avoid early adoption of a relapse prevention package and avoid the focus only on comparative studies to the exclusion of the less rewarding but more important developmental studies that will generate useful ideas for clinical testing.\n\nInterest in lapse and relapse is relatively recent, so needs for additional research abound. The area is ripe for studies on issues ranging from the natural history of relapse to methods that patients might employ in high-risk situations.\n\nTable 1 presents a list of research needs suggested from the various sections of this article. The topics include both theoretical and practical issues. We hope this will stimulate work in what is an important area of behavior change.\n\nRelapse remains one of the most important problems associated with the addictive disorders. Previous work suggested that relapse rates and the shapes of relapse curves are similar across the addictions. This article attempts to move beyond this by identifying commonalities in the process of relapse, and by pointing to the need for more information on the natural history, determinants, consequences, and prevention of lapse and relapse. We conceptualize behavior change as occurring in three stages (motivation and commitment, initial change, and maintenance of change) and propose specific methods for dealing with relapse at each stage. Writing this article strengthened our view that each area of the addictions has much to offer the others; therefore, we support more interaction among researchers and clinicians across the areas.\n\nJuly 1986 9 American Psychologist\n\nJuly 1986 ° American Psychologist\n\nJuly 1986 9 American Psychologist\n\nJuly 1986 9 A m e r i c a n Psychologist\n\nJuly t 9 8 6 9 A m e r i c a n Psychologist"
