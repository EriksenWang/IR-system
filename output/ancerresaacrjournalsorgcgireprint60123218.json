    "abstract": "Many of the strategies developed in the last few years to treat cancer by gene therapy are based on putative killer-suicide genes whose products convert a prodrug into a toxic compound. When the therapy is applied to humans, a vector carrying the killer gene is first inoculated into the tumor of the patient, who 1 week later receives the corresponding prodrug that will selectively kill the cells able to process it to its toxic derivative. A strategy that obviates the need for a prodrug to destroy the cancer cells would be preferable because the patient would only need one treatment instead of two consecutive ones. In the following study, we describe the construction of retroviral vectors in which a reporter or a toxin gene (either the Pseudomonas exotoxin or the Ricinus communis toxin, ricin) is placed under the control of the thyroid hormone (T 3 ) regulatable promoter of the rat myelin basic protein (MBPp). We demonstrate that the expression of these genes under the control of MBPp is regulated by T 3 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the MBPp is switched off when T 3 is removed from the serum of the culture medium, allowing the production of retroviruses carrying the toxic gene. In vivo, the toxin gene bearing retroviruses is capable of eradicating experimentally induced brain tumors in Wistar rats. The gene therapy strategy described here does not require the use of a prodrug to destroy the neoplastic cells.",
    "full_text": "Despite their regional pattern of growth and progression, malignant gliomas are the third leading cause of death from cancer in persons 15-34 years of age. This has led to the development of a series of gene therapy protocols based mainly on the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir system (1-9). However, total remission of human malignant brain tumors has not been achieved. The grim prognosis for patients with gliomas is related to a lack of potent agents with adequate tumor specificity.\n\nOver the last decade, a significant number of tumor tissue-selective promoters and enhancer elements have been isolated that have the potential to be used in gene therapy of malignancies (10). The regulation of specific genes is usually accomplished through the binding of transcription factors and associated proteins. The MBP, 3 the second most abundant protein in the CNS (11), contains an upstream regulatory sequence that confers cell type-and stage-specific transcription to MBP expression in oligodendrocytes during brain development (12)(13)(14). Transcriptional regulation analyses of the mbp gene in vitro do not show as clear a cell specificity as that seen in vivo (15)(16)(17)(18)(19). Nevertheless, a T 3 response element has been characterized within the MBPp. The hormone-receptor complex binds to this thyroid hormone response element to activate transcription, whereas repression is observed in the absence of the hormone (20).\n\nWe engineered a series of retroviral vectors to test the applicability of a MBPp/T 3 regulatable gene therapy system that would allow the expression of a toxic gene in the tumor cells while being able to tightly repress it in retroviral producer cells (⌿CRIP). Vectors carrying the luc reporter gene under the control of the MBPp showed high luc activity in the presence of T 3 and showed virtually no activity in its absence. By replacing the reporter gene with a toxin gene, we obtained toxic retrovirus producer cells only in the absence of T 3 . The presence of T 3 in vitro or in vivo (endogenous T 3 ) allowed a partial or total growth arrest of infected cell lines. Finally, we showed a total remission of induced brain tumors in Wistar rats treated with toxinretrovirus producer cells. These results indicate the feasibility of using a regulatable retroviral toxin gene therapy system for glioblastoma treatment.\n\nEcotropic retroviral packaging ⌿CRE cells and amphotropic retroviral packaging ⌿CRIP cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Rat glioblastoma C6 cells and human glioblastoma U-373-MG cultures were also grown in DMEM but were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. All cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 7% CO 2 and 97% relative humidity. Sera were depleted of T 3 using a HCl-Tris equilibrated ionic exchange AG-1X8 (Bio-Rad) resin (21).\n\nThe animals used were 2-or 3-month-old BALB/c females, SCID mice, and Wistar rats.\n\nThe luc gene was amplified by PCR using primers 5Ј-luc-BAMHI-GTGT-TGGATCCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC and 3Ј-luc-BAMHI-CAGTGGA-TCCTTACAATTTGGACTTTCC and cloned into the BamHI site of the Y plasmid (Ref. 22; pBabePuro-derived plasmid; Fig. 1) to generate the plasmid retro-luc. The 13-MBPp and 256-MBPp were obtained by HindIII/XhoI restriction enzyme digestion from the MBP1317CAT and MBP256CAT plasmids, respectively (17), and cloned into retro-luc (SalI site), creating plasmids retro-1.3MBPp-luc and retro-256MBPp-luc. To obtain retro-1.3MBPp-petoxin and retro-1.3MBPp-ri-toxin plasmids, the luc gene was removed by BamHI restriction enzyme treatment and substituted with either the HindIII/ XhoI fragment corresponding to the ricin gene from pEMBLyex4RA (23) or the XbaI-EcoRI cut pe gene (24) obtained from plasmid pVC45F (kindly provided by I. Pastan, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The pRSVTR␤ 1 plasmid used in cotransfection experiments contains the rat T 3 receptor gene (25) downstream from the RSV promoter (17). The LNCXTR␤ 1 plasmid contains the HindIII-HpaI TR␤ 1 fragment from pRSVTR␤ 1 under the control of the CMV promoter.\n\nPlasmids were transfected using either Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Tfx50 (Promega), following the protocols provided by the manufacturers. Producer cells were obtained by transfection of ecotropic packaging ⌿CRE cells and subsequent harvesting of the supernatant carrying the viral particles to infect the amphotropic packaging cell line ⌿CRIP, according to a method described previously (26). The supernatants of the transduced ⌿CRIP cells were used to infect the C6 and U-373-MG cell lines. Transfected and infected cells were selected in 2 g/ml puromycin, and the colonies obtained were pooled or cloned. Titers were estimated by infecting NIH-3T3 cells as described previously (4).\n\nCells (10 4 ) growing as monolayers were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 100 l of extraction buffer [100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mM DTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100], and incubated at 4°C for 5 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 300 ϫ g, and supernatants were collected for analysis. Assays were performed using 20 l of each extract plus 100 l of reaction buffer [17.5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 13 mM MgCl 2 , 12.5 mM ATP (pH 7.77), 52.5 M DTT, and 134 g/ml BSA] and 100 l of 1 mM luciferin. The number of relative light units produced during the first 10 s was recorded using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA).\n\nAfter 48 h in the presence or absence of T 3 , the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol at Ϫ20°C for 5 min. The cells were then blocked in PBS plus 1% BSA. This buffer was used in subsequent washing and antibody incubation steps. Cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with a rabbit anti-pe A antibody (Sigma) and incubated for a second hour with an antirabbit fluorescein or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham). After hybridization and the subsequent washing steps, the cells were mounted with Moviol 4-88 and the antibleaching reagent diazabicyclo[z.z.z]octane (DABCO). Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope.\n\nMeasurement of [ 3 H]Thymidine Incorporation into DNA. Cells (2 ϫ 10 4 ) growing as monolayers were labeled for 6 h with 8 Ci of [ 3 H]thymidine (Amersham) per well, trypsinized, and precipitated with 2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The results are the average of three independent experiments in which three identical sample points were measured each time.\n\nMethylene Blue Staining. Cells were fixed in 12% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.05% methylene blue, and eluted in 0.33 N HCl. Absorbance at 630 nm was determined in a MR 5000 microplate reader (Dynatech, West Sussex, United Kingdom). The results are the average of two independent experiments in which six identical samples were measured. Twenty BALB/c mice had 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-luc-infected C6 cells injected in the left flank. Ten of these mice had 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-ritoxin-infected C6 cells injected in the opposite flank, and the other 10 mice had 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin-infected C6 cells injected in the right flank. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the presence or absence of tumor was determined. Injections were performed in a similar way in the right flank of 10 Wistar rats: 5 rats were injected with 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-ri-toxin-infected C6 cells; and the other 5 rats were injected with 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-petoxin-infected C6 cells. All received injections of 5 ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-lucinfected C6 cells in the left flank.\n\nIntratumoral Injection. We have essentially followed the procedures described previously (3,4). Briefly, Wistar male rats weighing 250 -300 g were anesthetized with an inhalation mixture of 0.8 liter/min oxygen (O 2 ), 0.4 liter/min protoxide (N 2 O), and 3% isofluorane gas (Forane) before placing them in a stereotactic apparatus. During the operation, the same anesthetic was maintained. Five ϫ 10 5 retro-1.3MBPp-luc-, retro-1.3MBPp-ri-toxin-, or retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin-infected C6 cells or 5 ϫ 10 6 retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxinretrovirus-producing ⌿CRIP cells were injected at a concentration of 10 5 cells/l in complete PBS (containing calcium and magnesium) supplemented with 0.1% glucose. With the aid of the manipulating arm of the stereotactic apparatus, a total of 5 l was introduced over a 5-min interval into the frontoparietal lobe of the right cerebral hemisphere (4 mm to the right from the bregma and 4.5 mm deep from the skull) using a 5-l Hamilton syringe connected to a 26-gauge needle; the needle was kept in place 3 min before and after injection. Two weeks later, magnetic resonance visualization of the tumor and size estimation were performed.\n\nBrain tumors were induced as described above in Wistar rats using 5 ϫ 10 5 C6 glioma cells/animal. After tumor formation was detected by MRI, either 4 ϫ 10 6 ⌿CRIP-retro-1.3MBPp-luc-transduced cells or the same number of ⌿CRIP-retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin-transduced cells were inoculated at the same stereotactic coordinates used for the initial injection of C6 cells. During each day of the following week, each animal was given 200 g of T 3 (0.4 g/l) by i.p. injection.\n\nAll rats received tetracycline in drinking water (approximately 75 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (1 mg/500 ml) for 2 days before and after surgery.\n\nThe rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (50 mg/ml), valium (5 mg/ml), and atropine (1 mg/ml) in a 5:4:1 ratio by volume at a dose of 0.3 ml/100 g body weight to obtain the magnetic resonance image. In this study, axial, sagittal, and coronal views of the skull were made with a Cpflex small coil around the animal. Quantitative in vivo measurements included tumor volume and localized T1 and T2 relaxation times. Projection images were obtained from the 4-mm slice acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 420 ms, echo time (TE) of 17 ms, a 256 ϫ 512 matrix, and a 50 ϫ 100 field of view. T1 high-resolution images were obtained after enhancement with gadolinium (2 ml/kg). Tumors appear hyperintense, with distinct tumor margins and only moderate peritumoral edema.\n\nSystem. We have chosen the promoter region of the mouse mbp gene (18) as a possible candidate for glioma-specific transcription initiation. To analyze the tissue specificity conferred by the MBPp, different retroviral plasmids were constructed (retro-1.3MBPp-luc and retro-256MBPp-luc; Fig. 1). The vectors carried pac as a selection gene and luc as a reporter gene controlled by the 5Ј-LTR promoter in one case (retro-luc), by the large (1.3-kbp) MBPp in a second one, and by the small 256-bp MBPp in a third type of construct (17). In the retro-MBPp-luc plasmids, the promoter and gene were placed in opposite sense to retroviral 5Ј-LTR controlled transcription. C6 cells were transiently transfected with retro-1.3MBPp-luc and retro-256MBPp-luc and assayed for luc activity (Fig. 2A). As a control, plasmid Y, which does not contain the reporter gene, and plasmid retro-luc, which carries the luc gene under the control of the 5Ј-LTR promoter, were used. Activity was detected in all samples but the control. The vector retro-1.3MBPp-luc was then transfected to cells with a different tissue origin (⌿CRE, rat fibroblast), and after puromycin selection, luc activity was also measured (Fig. 2B). The large activity estimated shows that in vitro the MBPp does not maintain the cell specificity described in vivo.\n\nRegulation of MBPp-driven luc Expression by TR␤ 1 /T 3 . The role played by T 3 in the activation of the MBPp was tested using both transient (Fig. 3A) and stable transfections (Fig. 3, B and C). Because the levels of expression of the hormone receptor (TR␤ 1 ) were unknown, the retroviral LNCXTR␤ 1 or the nonretroviral pRSVTR␤ 1 plasmids containing the TR␤ 1 gene under the control of the or pRSV promoter were cotransfected with retroviral plasmids bearing the MBPp. Regulation of luc expression by the presence of T 3 is clearly observed in all cases (Fig. 3A). No increase in T 3 stimulation is observed in cotransfections with the hormone receptor TR␤ 1 , indicating the endogenous presence of this molecule in sufficient concentration to maintain the T 3 -dependent expression. Plasmid retro-1.3MBP-luc shows the greatest stimulation, being slightly better than the smaller (256-bp) MBPp at T 3 -mediated activation. luc activity was detected even in the absence of T 3 , probably due to the cell heterogeneity expected in culture cell lawns and transient expression, in which luc-expressing and non-luc-expressing cells are mixed.\n\nWhen packaging cell individual clones were obtained and their luc activities were assayed after growing them for 48 h in the presence or absence of T 3 , some of them showed a marked repression of the promoter in the absence of T 3 (Fig. 3B). Two clones in particular, clone 7 and especially clone 19, showed a very clear response to T 3 . Results that were not so excellent but good nonetheless were obtained using the small 256-bp MBPp, indicating that these 256 bp are sufficient to act as a T 3 regulatable element (Fig. 3C).\n\nGiven the tight levels of repression achieved in some clones using the reporter gene, we constructed two new vectors in which the luc gene was replaced by either the pe gene or the ricin gene (Fig. 1C). Producer cells of retroviruses bearing toxic genes were generated by transduction of the corresponding retroviral plasmid, followed by puromycin selection in the absence of T 3 . In the presence of T 3 , it was not possible to obtain a living culture. Antibodies against pe confirmed the expression of the gene product in the presence of T 3 and its absence when T 3 was removed from the serum (Fig. 4). The retroviruses produced by these cells were used to infect rat (C6) and human (U-373-MG) glioblastoma cells. After puromycin selection, stable cultures were maintained in the absence of T 3 . The activation of toxin expression from the MBPp in the presence of T 3 was also measured, estimating the death rate of these stable cell lines on the addition of T 3 -containing serum to the culture medium. A 50% reduction in the incorporation of [ 3 H]thymidine into DNA was observed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after T 3 treatment in the retro-MBPppe-toxin-infected ⌿CRIP and C6 cells. A 50% reduction was also seen in the human glioblastoma cell line U-373-MG infected with retro-1.3MBPp-ri, and a progressively decreasing reduction of as much as 70% was seen in the retro-MBPp-ri-toxin-infected ⌿CRIP cells (Table 1). The results were confirmed with methylene blue staining of live cells. Both toxins are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis and induce apoptosis (27). When the stable infected ⌿CRIP-MBPp-pe-toxin and ⌿CRIP-MBPp-ri-toxin were transferred to T 3containing medium for 24 h and labeled for 4 h with [ 35 S]methionine and [ 35 S]cysteine, a 50% inhibition of protein synthesis was observed (Table 2). All of the experiments presented here show that the toxins are expressed upon T 3 addition to the media in vitro and are able to induce significant cell death in the infected cells.\n\nTo evaluate the applicability of the system in vivo, we performed several experiments on SCID mice, normal mice, and Wistar rats.\n\nNeither retro-1.3MBPp-luc-nor retro-1.3MBPp-toxin-infected C6 cells were capable of progressing to form a tumor when injected into the flanks of immunocompetent rats (n ϭ 20). When C6-retro-1.3MBPp-luc cells were injected into the flanks of BALB/c (immunocompetent) mice, a small tumor developed in 3 of 20 inoculations, and no tumors developed in the C6-retro-1.3MBPp-toxin inoculations (Table 3). Nevertheless, s.c. tumors were easily induced by the injection of infected C6 cells into the lateral flanks of immunodeficient SCID mice. Thus, we injected retro-1.3MBPp-luc-infected C6 cells into the left flank of six mice as a negative control while injecting neoplastic cells infected with either retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin (n ϭ 3) or retro-1.3MBPp-ri-toxin (n ϭ 3) into the right side. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3, all control tumors developed well (Fig. 5, top row), whereas toxin-gene-retrovirus-infected neoplastic cells produced very small tumors or no tumor at all when cells were infected with the pe-retrovirus (as seen in the third pair in Fig. 5A). Cells infected with the ricin-retrovirus also gave rise to very small tumors (Fig. 5B; Table 3), but effect is not as great as that observed with the pe gene. The difference could be attributed to the presence of the receptor recognition domain in exotoxin A but not in the ricin gene, where only the catalytic polypeptide A has been expressed. The recognition domain is necessary for the interaction and introduction of the toxin into surrounding cells (28) and could account for a bystander effect. In the case of ricin, a higher toxic activity could probably be obtained by coexpression of both the A and B chains.\n\nIn a second set of experiments, retro-1.3MBPp-luc-infected C6 cells were injected into the rat brain and allowed to form a tumor Fig. 3. MBPp expression dependent on the presence of T 3 . A, luc activity detected in transient cotransfections of rat glioblastoma C6 cells in the presence or absence of T 3 in the medium. B, luc activity detected in individual clones of ⌿CRIP cells after stable cotransfection with retro-1.3MBPp-luc and pRSVTR␤ 1 in the presence and absence of T 3 . C, luc activity detected in individual clones of ⌿CRIP cells after stable cotransfection with retro-256MBPp-luc and pRSVTR␤ 1 in the presence and absence of T 3 . The luc activity represented in B and C was the result of single experiment. Fig. 4. Immunofluorescence microscopy of pe. Retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin producer ⌿CRIP cells were cultivated for 48 h in the absence (A) or presence (B) of T 3 and labeled with a polyclonal anti-exotoxin A antibody followed by a fluorescein-conjugated antirabbit second antibody. In C and D, retro-1.3 MBPp-pe-toxin-infected C6 cells were cultivated for 48 h in the absence (C) or presence (D) of T 3 . pe expression was detected as described previously using a Texas red-conjugated antirabbit second antibody.\n\n(n ϭ 2). In parallel, other animals (n ϭ 2) were inoculated with retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin-infected C6 cells (C6-retro-1.3 MBPp-petoxin). The same experiments were performed using the ricin-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 6, retro-1.3MBPp-luc-infected C6 cells produced a large tumor in the control animals (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas both the retro-1.3MBPp-pe-toxin (Fig. 6, C and D)-and retro-1.3MBPp-ri-toxin (Fig. 6, E and F)-infected C6 cells failed to develop a tumor (Table 3). This indicates that endogenous T 3 activates the MBPp, allowing the expression of the two different toxins that kill the neoplastic cells, preventing tumor formation.\n\nIn a third set of in vivo experiments that more closely reproduce a possible gene therapy protocol for human patients, brain tumors were induced in Wistar rats with C6 cells (5 ϫ 10 5 cells) and then treated with 4 ϫ 10 6 murine ⌿CRIP-retro-1.3 MBPp-pe-toxin retrovirus-producing cells. In control animals, the induced glioblastomas were treated with the same number of murine ⌿CRIP-retro-1.3 MBPp-luc cells. The murine retrovirus producer cells had a titer of 10 6 colonyforming units/ml and were injected at a single location (the same location used for C6 delivery, 4 mm to the right of Bregma and 4 mm in depth from the skull). We used retrovirus-producing cells instead of retrovirus because it is not easy to concentrate the virus into a small volume, and because the half-life of a retrovirus at 37°C is only a few hours (3-6 h). In Fig. 6, a tumor developed in a control animal treated with C6 cells can be seen (Fig. 6, G and H). The tumor continued to grow after treatment with ⌿CRIP-retroMBPp-luc cells (Fig. 6, I and J), and the animal died shortly thereafter. Tumors developed after C6 injection (Fig. 6, K and L) were nevertheless eradicated after intratumoral injection of 4 ϫ 10 6 murine ⌿CRIP-retro-1.3 MBPp-pe-toxin producer cells (Fig. 6, M and N). In both cases, the endogenous levels of T 3 were raised with a daily injection of 200 g (0.4 g/l) of commercial T 3 . No toxicity was observed in two control animals in which 5 ϫ 10 6 producer cells (⌿CRIP-retro-1.3 MBPp-pe-toxin) were injected into normal brain at the same location used for C6 injections.  The cpm of thymidine incorporated to DNA in a medium without T 3 are considered as 100%. A negative value is obtained when the total number of cpm of thymidine incorporated in cells growing with T 3 is higher than that in cells cultivated without the hormone.\n\nRetroviral vectors are widely used to transfer genes of interest into a variety of animal and human cells both in vitro and in vivo (29). These vectors are able to integrate permanently into the host cell genome (30). Retroviruses are ideally suited for gene therapy of malignant gliomas developed in the CNS, where the normal cells are already mature and do not divide. Because rapidly growing normal cells are rare in the adult CNS, glioma cells can be specifically transduced with a recombinant retrovirus. The clinical assays performed to date have shown that gene transfer into brain tumors is feasible and is capable of inducing a biologically significant response (31). However, several limitations to the general approach persist (32). To address some of these problems, we have studied the use of a regulatable expression system in retrovirusmediated gene therapy.\n\nSelective transcriptional control sequences provide a tool of significant potential to the gene therapist (10). We chose a promoter specific for glial tissue, mainly oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, whose activation and repression are dependent on the presence of T 3 and its receptor, TR␤ 1 (33). Our results, in agreement with those of other authors, show that the tissue specificity is lost in vitro (17)(18)(19). However, we did observe T 3 -regulated expression in vitro. As cotransfection experiments have shown, the presence of TR␤ 1 did not affect the expression of the MBPp-regulated reporter gene, indicating that, as other authors have found previously (20), the endogenous TR␤ 1 levels in some cells are sufficient to maintain a T 3 -dependent expression from this promoter.\n\nDifferent experimental transcription systems have shown that activation is often not absolute and that the levels can vary significantly between experimental models or cell lines. These characteristics may be incompatible with the stringent needs of a given therapeutic application (34,35). We have been able to obtain a total repression of a reporter gene after selecting an adequate clone (⌿CRIP-retro-1.3MBPp-luc clones 7, 11, 18, and 19). The specificity of cellular promoters inserted in the retroviral genome could be overridden by native viral promoters (36 -38). We have observed that certain clones lose the T 3 control of expression when cultured for extended periods (data not shown), and others do not show regulation at all. There is a small difference in T 3 luc control expression between the use of the 1300-bp or the 256-bp MBPps on behalf of the longer one (Fig. 3), but the 256-bp promoter is sufficient to act as a T 3 regulatable element.\n\nWhen the reporter gene was substituted with a toxic gene, we obtained lawns of transduced packaging producer cells using T 3depleted media. Once the selected puromycin-resistant lawns were transferred to T 3 -containing media, the maximal cell death registered was 70%, although the surviving cells grew very slowly and in most of cases were unable to produce stable cell lines.\n\nThe critical point in the procedure described here is the in vitro culture of retroviral producer cells in which the toxin promoter must be turned off completely, whereas the retroviral promoters should be very active. Cells in which a complete repression of the toxin is not achieved will die in culture. However, long-term culture of the infected cells favors the selection of cells that are unable to express the toxin in a T 3 -dependent manner. To minimize this problem, cells under puromycin selection were never cultured for longer than 2 months.\n\nToxins are highly immunogenic molecules (27), and it is very likely that the system operates indirectly via a bystander effect mediated by an immune reaction against toxin-producing cells. Indeed, our results show that rejection of tumors is more efficient in the brain of immunocompetent rats (Wistar) than in SCID mice flanks, suggesting a putative immunomediated bystander effect. In all of the cases studied, the ricin toxin seemed to be less efficient than Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, which was cloned with the eukaryotic receptor recognition domain. Therefore, the success of this gene therapy system in vivo may depend in part on the toxic gene chosen and the orientation of this gene in the retroviral construct.\n\nThe gene therapy procedure described in this study can be considered simpler than other killer-suicide systems (1,8,9) because a single injection of producer cells at the tumor site is sufficient to eliminate the tumor completely, and no side effects have been detected. This system, based on the regulation of toxin gene expression, presents potentially curative applications for the treatment of human brain tumors.\n\non October 27, 2014. © 2000 American Association for Cancer cancerres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from\n\non October 27, 2014. © 2000 American Association for Cancer cancerres.aacrjournals.org\n\nCANCER GENE THERAPY BY TOXIN GENE EXPRESSION Research. on October 27, 2014. © 2000 American Association for Cancer cancerres.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from"
