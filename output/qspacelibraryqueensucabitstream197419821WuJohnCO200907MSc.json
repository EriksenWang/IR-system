    "abstract": "N-glycosylation is a metabolic process found in all three domains of life. It is the attachment of a polysaccharide glycan to asparagine (Asn) residues within the amino acid motif, Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr. In the archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis, a tetrasaccharide glycan was isolated from purified flagella and its structure determined by mass spectrometry analysis. The linking sugar to the protein is surprisingly, N-acetylgalactosamine (β-GalNAc), with the next proximal sugar a derivative of N-acetylglucosamine (β-GlcNAc), being named β-GlcNAc3Ac, and the third sugar a derivative of N-acetylmannosamine (β-ManNAc), with an attached threonine residue on the C6 carbon (β-ManNAc3NAm). The terminal sugar is an unusual diglycoside of aldulose ((5S)-2-acetamido-2,4-dideoxy-5-O-methyl-α-L-erythro-hexos-5-ulo-1,5pyranose). Previous genetic analyses identified the glycosyltransferases (GTs) responsible for the transfer of the second and third sugars of the glycan, as well as the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) which attaches the glycan to protein. Left unidentified were the first and fourth GTs, the flippase as well as any genes involved in glycan sugar biosynthesis and modification. In this work, genes suspected to be involved in the biosynthesis of N-linked sugars, as well as those that might encode the missing GTs and flippase were targeted for in-frame deletion. Mutants with a deleted annotated GT gene (MMP1088) had a small decrease in flagellin molecular weight as determined by immunoblotting. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis confirmed that the N-linked glycan was missing the terminal sugar as well as the threonine found on the third sugar of wildtype cells. Mutants with a deleted gene annotated to be involved in acetamidino synthesis (a functional group that is present on the third sugar), also had a decrease in flagellin molecular weight. MS analysis determined that the N-linked glycan was missing the acetamidino group on the third sugar as well as its attached threonine, along with the terminal sugar. Both mutants were able to assemble functional flagella but had impaired motility compared to wildtype cells in miniiii swarm agar. Deletions were also constructed in four other GT genes considered candidates in assembly of the linking sugar. However, none of these mutants had the expected decrease in flagellin molecular weight.\nWith the work done in this study, the glycosyl transferase that attaches the last sugar of the M. maripaludis N-linked assembly pathway has been identified as well as a gene involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the glycan sugars.",

I also appreciate the many opportunities provided for me to develop my research and intellectual skills. The following 'work' simply did not feel like such during my time with him and it was always a pleasure to go into the lab.\n\nI would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Keith Poole and Dr. Andrew Daugulis, for providing valuable advice throughout my degree and for accommodating my needs within their own time schedules and research.\n\nIn addition, many thanks to Susan Logan, who provided mass spectrometry analysis in this study (Figures 3.7                                 vii Figure 3.20: Electron micrograph of ∆MMP1081 cell ..................................................................       viii Table 2. Carl Woese's analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences led to a revised classification system of all living organisms that now consists of the three domains of Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea (Woese and Olsen, 1986). Although the majority of microbiology research has focused on bacteria and their impact on our environment and health, archaea could also play a role in these fields and beyond.\n\nArchaea may have initially gained recognition and curiosity for their ability to thrive in extreme environments (e.g. acidic, anaerobic, hyperthermophilic and halophilic), but recent culture-independent studies have revealed that they are ubiquitous (Chaban et al., 2006). Archaea are especially abundant in the ocean (estimated to comprise one third of all prokaryotic cells) and can live within the mesopelagic realm of the ocean where minimal light is present (Karner et al., 2001). These archaea may play a significant role in the oceanic carbon cycle with their ability to metabolize inorganic carbon under anaerobic conditions (Herndl et al., 2005). Other archaea are also capable of metabolic processes that benefit the environment, including the ability to oxidize ammonia to nitrate (contributing to the nitrogen cycle) and oxidize methane anaerobically, which converts one of the most potent green house gases into environmentally friendly bicarbonate (Könneke et al., 2005;Caldwell et al., 2008). A better understanding of biodegrading archaeal species can have great environmental impact by reducing the amount of organic pollutants across the globe (Le Borgne et al., 2008).\n\nMethanogens, in particular, have an important ecological niche in anaerobic environments, where complex organic matter, such as sewage, is degraded to methane and carbon dioxide (Schink, 1997). They create methane as a by-product of their anaerobic respiration, obtaining ATP and energy through the oxidation of substrates (such as acetate, carbon dioxide and methanol) and the use of hydrogen as an electron donor (Zeikus, 1977). Anaerobic biodegradation of complex organic substrates requires three groups of organisms, starting with primary fermenting bacteria, followed sometimes by secondary fermenting bacteria and always terminating with methanogens (McInerney, 1988). Briefly, the primary fermenting bacteria utilize their hydrolytic enzymes to convert organic polymers (such as polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids) into oligomers and monomers (sugars, amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids and glycerol), which are further broken down into fatty acids, succinate, lactate, acetate and alcohols. Some of these products (acetate, one-carbon compounds, and hydrogen gas) can be used directly by methanogens to produce methane and CO 2 , while others need to be processed further by the secondary fermenting bacteria. The intermediate products are often toxic to the primary and secondary bacteria, along with most of the other organisms living within the ecosystem (Schink, 1997). Methanogens regulate the entire process with methanogenesis being essential for reducing the amount of intermediate waste.\n\nScientific pursuits to explore space and encounter extraterrestrial life may also point to archaea since they are capable of living in desolate environments. Recent landings on Mars indicate no signs of surface water but report a landscape full of canyons and gullies that suggests the presence of water at some point in the planet's history (Baker, 2001). Furthermore, a methane cycle on the planet has been observed, suggesting biological life, while leading others to question the source of the replenished methane (Formisano et al., 2004;Mumma et al., 2009). Since on Earth, methanogens produce methane as a by-product of their anaerobic respiration, it would not be surprising to find a similar archaeal-like habitant on Mars (Kral et al., 2004;Kendrick and Kral, 2006). Interestingly, the presence of such organisms on Earth has led to the awareness of forward contamination where NASA equipment and landing gear may introduce microorganisms to Mars (Moissl et al., 2008).\n\nArchaea may also have an impact on the medical sciences (Conway de Macario and Macario, 2008). Recently, it has been proposed that gut methanogens play a role in obesity (Zhang et al., 2009) while some patients with diseases such as diverticulitis and colon cancer have elevated numbers of archaea within their digestive tract (Eckburg et al., 2003). The most well understood disease associated with archaea is periodontitis, where the severity of the disease is strongly correlated with the presence of archaea (Vianna et al., 2008). The use of archaeal polar lipids in liposomes has also been shown to elicit a more potent adjuvant immune response for vaccines compared to the use of bacterial liposomes (Krishnan et al., 2001). With interest increasing in these related fields, archaea may be shown to have a larger impact in our daily lives than previously expected.\n\nThe revised tree of life, as shown in Figure 1.1, demonstrates further potential for research in archaea. Although there are many archaeal specific traits, archaea share many similarities to their prokaryotic relative in bacteria, while also possessing more eukaryotic-like properties than bacteria (Yutin et al., 2008). This is especially apparent in archaeal transcription and translation systems (Grabowski and Kelman, 2003). In addition to discoveries specific to archaea, some of which can be used commercially such as the DNA polymerases (Saiki et al., 1988;Cariello et al., 1991 andMarsic et al., 2008), archaea can also provide an equivalent system in a simpler study model compared to those found in Eukaryotes and Bacteria (Ouhammouch, 2004). In addition, studies in archaea can provide novel insight into eukaryotic or bacterial systems (Duggin and Bell, 2006). Some examples include the identification of a new catalytic motif in oligosaccharyl transferases after the crystallization of this enzyme from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus and how the knowledge of an archaeal cysteine pathway led to the discovery of selenocysteine biosynthesis in humans (Igura et al., 2008;Su et al., 2009).\n\nIn this study, the genetics behind the archaeal N-linked glycosylation system was investigated by monitoring glycosylated flagellin proteins that assemble into the motility apparatus, the archaeal flagellum.\n\nAlthough there are many lineages of archaea, relatively few can be cultivated and grown routinely in the laboratory (Schleper et al., 2005). Some of these include Pyrococcus, Haloferax, Sulfolobus and Methanococcus species, where sometimes challenging growth conditions are required. Still, within these species the genetic tools are limited in comparison to those available for many bacteria. Fortunately, recent advancements in technology and molecular biology techniques have enabled gene deletion studies to be performed in some of these archaea (Rother and Metcalf, 2005). The archaeon used in this study is the obligate anaerobe, Methanococcus maripaludis, isolated from the salt marsh sediments in South Carolina (Whitman et al., 1986).\n\nProkaryotes have developed a wide variety of methods for movement to seek optimal living environments (Jarrell and McBride, 2008). Some methods include the rotational motor of flagella, use of gas vesicles, expulsion of polysaccharide mucous, a novel motility process called twitching which uses type IV pili and many more where the mechanisms of action are unknown.\n\nExtracellular appendages, such as flagella and pili, are most common and readily observed via microscopy (Oda et al., 2007;Craig et al., 2006). However, motile cells that lack any obvious appendages have also been documented (Jarrell and McBride, 2008). Research conducted to unravel the mysteries in assembly and function of motility structures, especially bacterial flagella and type IV pili, has been quite successful and will be reviewed in this study. Meanwhile, many archaeal species are known to be flagellated with a structure that superficially resembles that found in bacteria (Jarrell et al., 1996). However, further investigation revealed that fundamental differences exist in regard to assembly and structure despite the similarities in appearance and function of the two appendages. This work will be discussed later in the study.\n\nThe bacterial flagellum is a propulsive structure found in variable numbers and spatial arrangements, depending on the bacteria as shown in Figure 1.2 (Macnab, 2004). For example, lophotrichous bacteria (e.g. Spirillum vultans) possess multiple flagella at the same cell location while monotrichous bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have a single flagellum.\n\nAmphitrichous bacteria (e.g. Aquaspirillum magnetotacticum) contain two flagella at opposite poles of the cell and peritrichous bacteria (e.g. E. coli) possess flagella inserted around the entire cell surface. Although there are exceptions, flagella generally function such that a counterclockwise rotation generates a thrusting force that propels the cell forward whereas a clockwise rotation induces a tumbling motion that permits a change in direction, which is important for chemotaxis. Energy for rotation is usually achieved through a proton motive force while in some cases Na + ions are used (Macnab, 2004).\n\nBacterial flagella can run lengths of 15-20 µm (Ferris and Minamino, 2006). They are long, hollow tube structures (18-24 nm in diameter) that are composed of many types of proteins.\n\nStructurally, flagella are characterized by three regions called the basal body, hook and filament (Macnab, 2004). The basal body anchors the flagellum through the use of ring structures located in the cytoplasm (C ring), the cell membrane (MS ring), peptidoglycan (P ring) and outer membrane (L ring) for Gram negatives (Macnab, 2003). The rings are connected throughout the periplasm by rod proteins. Nearly all of the flagella proteins need to be exported across the cell membrane, with the exception of the proteins that form the C-ring and MS-ring (Macnab, 2003).\n\nThe L and P-ring proteins are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using the Sec pathway while the rest of the flagellar subunits, including those for the rod, hook and filament, are exported using a type III secretion apparatus located at the base of the flagellum within the Cring (Homma et al., 1987;Hirano et al., 2003). The presence of capping proteins is important for the proper assembly of the different flagellar subunits after they are exported (Yonekura et al., 2000). Each region (rod, hook, and filament) is assembled with its respective capping protein.\n\nRod proteins are exported first and assemble under the rod capping protein, FlgJ, followed by hook proteins with the aid of the hook cap, FlgD (Macnab, 2003). The rod capping protein has a unique muramidase activity that allows the rod to assemble past the peptidoglycan layer (Hirano et al., 2001). Synthesis of the filament occurs when subunits are exported through the central canal created with the proper assembly of the rod and hook region and assembled beneath the capping protein (HAP2) at the distal end of the growing flagellum as shown in Figure 1.3 (Imada et al., 1998).\n\nType IV pili are found in a variety of Gram negative and, more recently, Gram positive bacteria (Varga et al., 2006). Type IV pili are used by bacteria for many processes such as adhesion, DNA uptake, biofilm formation, phage transduction and twitching motility (Pelicic, 2008). Their ability to extend and retract is of particular interest to this study, since twitching motility requires extension and retraction of the pilus to drag the cell forward along a surface as shown in Figure 1. 4 (Henrichsen, 1983;Burrows 2005). Unlike many other pili structures which require very few proteins for assembly, type IV pili use at least a dozen and these are usually encoded by genes within the same operon (Craig and Li, 2008). Interestingly, many of these genes are homologues to those found in type II secretion systems, including the ATPase that powers pilus extension and retraction (Russel, 1998).\n\nType IV pili are primarily composed of a highly conserved 15-20 kDa pilin subunit that is synthesized as a preprotein (Craig and Li, 2008). Many bacterial proteins are synthesized as preproteins, containing N-terminal signal peptide sequences that are ultimately cleaved and this allows for protein recognition and trafficking (Pohlschroder et al., 1997). Signal peptide sequences contain a classical motif at the N-terminus with a basic n-region, followed by a hydrophobic core (h-region) and ending in a carboxyl-terminal region (c-region) that includes the cleavage site recognized by signal peptidases (von Heijne, 1983). There are several classes of signal peptides, with each class associated with its corresponding signal peptidase that recognizes and cleaves the peptide sequence (Paetzel et al., 2002). Type IV pilins require their own peptidase (type IV prepilin peptidase (TFPP)) and contain an unique class III signal peptide in which the cleavage site is found after the n-region, leaving the hydrophobic core with the mature protein   (Ng et al., 2007). The hydrophobic region makes up the core of the pilus structure and is important for the assembly and interaction of the pilin subunits (Albers and Pohlschröder, 2009).\n\nAssembly of type IV pili occurs at the cell membrane (Crowther et al., 2004). It is proposed that the minimum assembly apparatus requires an inner membrane protein, responsible for recruiting the remaining accessory assembly proteins, and an energy providing ATPase (Craig and Li, 2008;Turner et al., 1993;Nunn et al., 1990). Pilin subunits pool in the inner membrane\n\nwhere their signal peptides are cleaved by a membrane bound signal peptidase before being inserted at the base of the pilus filament. ATP-hydrolysis is needed for incorporation of the pilin subunit causing the filament to extrude outwards (Wolfgang et al., 2000). Accessory secretin proteins homopolymerize within the outer membrane to form a hole that allows the growing pilus to pass through (Collins et al., 2005). Similarly for retraction, ATP-hydrolysis provided by a different ATPase, removes the pilin subunits at the base of the structure and returns them to the cell membrane (Burrows, 2005).\n\nThe archaeal flagellum is a unique motility structure that superficially looks and functions as its bacterial counterpart. It is characterized by three regions similar to those in the bacterial flagellum; a cell anchoring portion (basal body equivalent), a hook and a filament (VanDyke et al., 2008b). However, notable differences throughout each substructure of the archaeal and bacterial flagella can be seen. Starting at the basal body, the composition of the archaeal anchoring structure remains unknown, with the only observation pertaining to knob-like structures seen in electron micrographs of extracted archaeal flagella, which bear little resemblance to the rod and ring complexes seen in bacterial flagella (Kalmokoff et al., 1988;Kupper et al., 1994). Archaeal anchoring structure genes and proteins have not yet been identified\n\nin any species and homologues to bacterial basal body proteins cannot be found (Faguy et al., 1992). This suggests that the archaeal flagellum is most likely attached to the cell wall and membrane by a novel mechanism. Differences also occur in the hook region where a single \"flagellin\" protein has been shown to compose the hook in M. maripaludis and likely in M. voltae (Chaban et al., 2007;Bardy et al., 2002). A \"flagellin\" was also identified in Halobacterium salinarum, as forming the hook region (Tarasov et al., 2000;Beznosov et al., 2007). In bacteria, the hook protein is very different in sequence from the flagellins. Electron microscopy reveals that the length of the archaeal hook (72-265 nm) is also more variable than in bacteria (consistently around 55 nm) (Bardy et al., 2002). Studies on the filament reveal that the diameter is much smaller for archaea in comparison to bacteria (10-14 nm vs 18-24 nm) (Trachtenberg and Cohen-Krausz, 2006). Variations in the composition of the filament are also observed where multiple copies of a single bacterial flagellin are typically assembled rather than the multiple types of flagellins (variations in the flagellin proteins FlaB and FlaA) found in all archaea, with the exception of Sulfolobus species (Jarrell et al., 1996). Another fundamental difference between the two organelles is that the rotation of archaeal flagella is driven by ATP hydrolysis rather than the proton motive force that drives bacterial flagella (Streif et al., 2008). Finally, and very significantly, the archaeal filament lacks the 2 nm central channel observed in bacterial flagella, which is essential for bacterial flagella assembly via the type III secretion system (Trachtenberg and Cohen-Krausz, 2006), suggesting an alternative method of assembly must occur in archaeal flagella (Jarrell et al., 1996).\n\nThe gene region encoding flagella structural proteins or proteins involved in flagella assembly is depicted in Figure 1.5 (VanDyke et al., 2008b). Assembly of the archaeal flagella is predicted to resemble the mechanism seen for type IV pili (Bardy et al., 2004). This is supported by the conservation of the flaHIJ gene cluster within known flagellated archaeal species, where flaI and flaJ are homologues to the type IV pilin ATPase (PilT) and a conserved membrane protein that interacts with the ATPase (PilC), respectively (Thomas and Jarrell, 2001).\n\nFurthermore, archaeal flagellins are synthesized as preflagellins that contain a signal peptide sequence similar to those for prepilin proteins (Ng et al., 2007). Not surprisingly, the signal 13 peptidase proteins (FlaK and PibD) found in M. voltae and Sulfolobus solfataricus species, are homologues to the type IV prepilin peptidase (Bardy and Jarrell, 2002;Albers et al., 2003).\n\nInactivation of flaK in M. voltae and M. maripaludis resulted in nonflagellated cells demonstrating that peptidase processing is required for flagellins to assemble into flagella (Bardy and Jarrell, 2003). Homology is also observed when comparing the sequences of the archaeal flagellin and type IV pilin, where the sequence of the N-terminal 40 amino acids is highly conserved (Ng et al., 2006). Finally, the lack of a central channel in the archaeal flagellum also supports a type IV pili method of assembly, where subunits are incorporated at the base of the structure (Trachtenberg and Cohen-Krausz, 2006).\n\nWhile sharing similarities to type IV pili, assembly of the archaeal flagella also involves unique proteins that are not found in any other domain (Thomas and Jarrell, 2001). In-frame deletion studies revealed that within the encoded region of flagellar accessory proteins, FlaCDEFG, all the genes were essential for flagellation, with the possible exception of flaD and flaE, which could not be deleted (Chaban et al., 2007). However, attempts to identify the structure, localization and function of these proteins have only recently begun.\n\nGlycosylation is the attachment of polysaccharides (or glycans) to specific amino acids (sometimes within conserved motifs) within proteins and is likely an important factor for proper assembly, folding, stability and function (Helenius and Aebi, 2001;Mitra et al., 2006;Hanson et al., 2009). There are several types of glycosylation, with O-linked and N-linked systems found in prokaryotes. O-linked glycosylation is characterized by the attachment of the glycan to the hydroxyl group found on the side chains of serine and threonine (Peter-Katalinic, 2005). The majority of bacteria use O-linkage for protein glycosylation although there are several exceptions, with Campylobacter being the best studied due to the presence of both O-linked and N-linked glycosylation systems (Szymanski et al., 2003). N-linked glycosylation is the attachment of glycan through a β-glycosylamide linkage to the NH 2 group found on the side chain of asparagine residues within the sequon Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid other than proline (Weerapana and Imperiali 2006). N-linked glycosylation was once believed to be a unique eukaryotic trait until the discovery of N-linked glycans in the S-layer of the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum and later in the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni, which demonstrated the prevalence of N-linked glycosylation in all three domains of life (Mescher and Strominger, 1976;Szymanski et al., 2003).\n\nN-linked glycosylation is essential in eukaryotes and has been most studied in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Burda and Aebi, 1999). Recent studies have demonstrated the role of N-linked glycoproteins in cell signaling and cell adhesion in cancer, as well as in accelerating protein folding and enhancing protein stability in the secretory pathway (Zhao et al., 2008;Hanson et al., 2009). Furthermore, deficiencies in glycosylation lead to a variety of disorders that are classified as congenital disorders of glycosylation. These disorders include deficiencies in growth and mental development, seizures and physical abnormalities (Leroy, 2006), and underline the importance of understanding the N-linked glycosylation pathway.\n\nEukaryote N-linked glycosylation begins on the cytoplasmic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and terminates in the lumen of the ER with the transfer of a tetradecasaccharide (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ) glycan to the N-linked motif in the protein (Burda and Aebi, 1999). The assembly of the glycan requires the sequential addition of activated nucleotide monosaccharides to a dolichol pyrophosphate lipid carrier embedded in the ER membrane, with the aid of glycosyltransferases or Alg (asparagine-linked glycosylation) proteins (entire pathway shown in Figure 1.6). The dolichol lipid is a polyisoprenoid composed of 80-100 carbons and differs from the undecaprenyl lipid carrier used in the bacterial N-linked pathway due to its terminating α-saturated isoprenoid containing an alcohol functional group (Zhang et al., 2008) It is not present in the final glycan linkage and is used only for glycan assembly and transport.\n\nflippase\n\nIn eukaryotes, the linking sugar to the dolichol lipid is N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)\n\nand it is attached by the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase called Alg7 (Kukuruzinska and Robbins, 1987). The second GlcNAc is attached by a protein complex consisting of Alg13/14, where Alg13 is the catalytic glycosyltransferase unit while Alg14 recruits Alg13 to the ER membrane (Gao et al., 2005;Gao et al., 2008). Finally, five mannose monosaccharides are added to the growing glycan through the activities of a series of glycosyltransferase in the order of Alg1, Alg2 and Alg11 (Gao et al., 2004). Alg1 attaches the first mannose in an unique β-1,4\n\nlinkage while Alg2 and Alg11 are each responsible for attaching two successive mannoses (Takeuchi et al., 1999;Cipollo et al., 2001).\n\nThe Man 5 GlcNAc 2 -dol intermediate is then translocated or flipped from the cytoplasmic side to the luminal side of the ER. Until recently, it had been widely accepted that this process was independent of ATP and required the protein Rft1, which is a transmembrane protein found only in the ER of eukaryotic cells that are capable of N-linked glycosylation (Helenius et al., 2002). However, the role of Rft1 as the flippase was recently questioned by Frank et al (2008) who suggested that a novel ER protein is performing the flipping function. The identity of this new flippase protein remains unknown and with early experiments only performed in vitro (Sanyal et al., 2008;Sanyal and Mennon, 2009). Much debate on the true identity of the N-linked flippase remains, with its resolution being highly anticipated (Frank et al., 2008).\n\nOnce inside the lumen of the ER, sugar donors are no longer nucleotide-activated and instead are dolichol-phosphate linked (Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc). Four additional mannose sugars are attached inside the lumen of the ER through the activity of Alg3, followed by Alg9, then Alg12 and finally Alg9 again (Verostek et al., 1993;Burda et al., 1999;Frank and Aebi, 2005). Alg6, Alg8 and Alg10 complete the glycan with the sequential addition of three glucose sugars (Reiss et al., 1996;Stagljar et al., 1994;Burda and Aebi, 1998). The final structure of the attached glycan is shown in Figure 1.7. In the final step of the N-linked process, the completed glycan is recognized by the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex, and transferred to select asparagine residues within the N-linked sequon (Knauer and Lehle, 1999). Interestingly, N-linked glycans are not attached to all possible sequons, which may be a result of a variety of factors including protein folding and access for glycan attachment (Jones et al., 2005). The OST complex is composed of multiple proteins that span across the ER membrane. The largest subunit, Stt3p, contains the catalytic domain of the complex which is characterized by the amino acid sequence, WWDYG (Zufferey et al., 1995). This sequence is highly conserved in oligosaccharyl transferases across all three domains of life. The glycan can be processed further within the ER and Golgi complex with additional glycosylation, trimming, sulfation and epimerization (where sugars have the same molecular formula but enzymatic activity alters the stereochemistry at one of its stereogenic centers) (Szymanski and Wren, 2005).\n\nThe basic concepts of the eukaryotic N-linked glycosylation system are found in the equivalent bacterial system where a heptasaccharide (GlcNAc 2 GalNAc 5 , shown in Figure 1.8) is assembled on a lipid carrier embedded in the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane before being flipped outwards to the periplasmic side. Unlike the eukaryotic pathway, no additional sugars are added to the glycan after flipping has occurred while an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate lipid is utilized as the lipid carrier rather than a dolichol pyrophosphate lipid (Chen et al., 2007).\n\nGenes residing in the model Campylobacter N-glycosylation gene cluster were given the prefix pgl (protein glycosylation). The functional transfer of the entire pgl gene cluster into E. coli was significant for further investigation of the N-linked system due to the molecular tools available in E. coli (Wacker et al., 2002).\n\nSteps in the assembly of the bacterial N-linked glycan in Campylobacter are well studied and are shown in Figure 1.9 (Szymanski et al., 2003). The initial sugar, GlcNAc, is attached to the undecaprenyl lipid on the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane by the glycosyltransferase, PglC (Glover et al 2006). The GlcNAc is then modified into a bacillosamine sugar by the enzymes PglF, PglE and PglD which function as a dehydratase, aminotransferase and  are assembled onto the glycan through the ordered actions of PglA, PglJ and PglH (Glover et al., 2005). Deficient pglH mutants accumulate a trisaccharide glycan and additional studies demonstrated that PglH is responsible for attaching the final three GalNAc sugars (Weerapana et al., 2005;Glover et al., 2005).\n\nThe completed heptasaccharide glycan is then flipped across the cell membrane to the periplasmic side. In contrast to the ATP-independent method of Rft1 in eukaryotes, bacteria require the use of ATP to translocate the glycan across membranes (Alaimo et al., 2006). A single ATP Binding Cassette (ABC)-transporter protein, PglK, is sufficient for glycan flipping as proven using the E. coli strain that possessed the Campylobacter pgl gene cluster (minus pglK) but was deficient in all known flippases (Kelly et al., 2006;Alaimo et al., 2006). Restoration of N-linked glycoproteins was observed when pglK was introduced via a plasmid (Alaimo et al., 2006).\n\nIn contrast to the oligosaccharyl transferase complex used in eukaryotes, a single protein transfers the glycan to proteins with N-linked asparagine residues. The bacterial transferase is PglB, which contains the conserved catalytic domain of WWDYG, and is a homologue of the Stt3p subunit found in the eukaryotic OST complex (Glover et al., 2005).\n\nUntil recently, knowledge of the archaeal N-linked system was fragmented although it is believed to follow a similar process to the eukaryotic and bacterial systems. Early studies in the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum, reported S-layer glycoproteins that contained both O-and Nlinked glycans (Mescher and Strominger, 1976). Localization of the N-linked system was determined to be at the cell membrane and periplasm, as in bacteria, due to the observation that the cell-impermeable antibiotic bacitracin was capable of disrupting N-glycosylation (Mescher et al., 1976). Furthermore, peptides containing the N-linked sequon, and incapable of entering the cell, became glycosylated when introduced to growing cultures (Lechner et al., 1985). The archaeal N-linked system also shares similarities with the eukaryotic equivalent by using dolichol as its lipid carrier (Burda and Aebi, 1999). The most recent archaeal N-linked glycosylation genetic studies have been fairly successful in species such as Haloferax volcanii, M. voltae and M. maripaludis thanks in part to the advancements of genetic tools for these organisms.\n\nMass spectrometry studies determined that the methanogens, M. voltae and M.\n\nmaripaludis, possessed a trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide glycan, respectively, attached to flagellins and S-layer (Figure 1.10). The structure of the M. voltae glycan is β-ManNAcA6Thr-\n\n, with the attachment to the protein occurring through GlcNAc (Voisin et al., 2005). The M. maripaludis glycan is Sug-4-β-ManNAc3NAmA6Thr-4-β-GlcNAc3NAcA-3-β-GalNAc, with the terminal Sug being a novel monosaccharide, a diglycoside of aldulose or 2NAc-2,4 dideoxy-hex-5-ulose (Kelly et al., 2009). Several differences in the M.\n\nvoltae and M. maripaludis glycans are observed including the nature of the initial sugar attached to dolichol, where GlcNAc and GalNAc are used, respectively (Chaban et al., 2006;VanDyke et al., 2009). The second sugar, GlcNAc3NAcA, is identical in both glycans while the third sugar is similar with the exception of an additional acetamidino group in M. maripaludis. The glycan of M. maripaludis includes a fourth sugar, a diglycoside of aldulose, which is the first reported natural occurrence of this sugar (VanDyke et al., 2009). Meanwhile, a pentasaccharide glycan was determined to be attached on H. volcanii glycoproteins (Yurist-Doutsch and Eichler, 2009).\n\nAlthough the specific structure of the pentasaccharide has not been determined, it is known to be composed of two hexoses, two hexuronic acids and an additional 190 Da saccharide (Abu-Qarn et al., 2007).The variable length of glycan and its composition demonstrate the diversity of the Nlinked system among archaea (Yurist-Doutsch et al., 2008). Genetic studies in M. voltae, M. maripaludis and H. volcanii have identified several genes involved in the N-linked process and these have been annotated as agl (archaeal glycosylation) genes.\n\nThe identification of archaeal glycosyl transferases has only recently begun. In M. voltae, Chaban et al (2006)  the glycan, while AglC and AglK were both required for second sugar attachment. In M. voltae, the glycosyl transferase AglH is a homologue of the yeast eukaryotic glycosyl transferase Alg7\n\n(N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase) and is believed to be responsible for the addition of the initial sugar to the dolichol lipid. Attempts to link this function to AglH through genetic knockout studies were unsuccessful likely due to the gene's presumed involvement in the synthesis of co-factor B (7-mercaptoheptanoylthreoninephosphate), which is essential for methanogens (Noll et al., 1986). Co-factor B performs the redox reaction CH 3 -S-CoM+ HS-CoB (Sauer, 1986). It contains a glycan that may require the activity of AglH for attachment (White, 2001;Chaban et al., 2006). The role of AglH was indirectly supported by the observation that AglH was capable of restoring the function of Alg7 in a conditional lethal S.\n\ncervisiae strain when alg7 was deactivated (Shams-Eldin et al., 2008). While this provides strong evidence for the role of AglH in glycan assembly for M. voltae because the GlcNAc-dolichol linkage is consistent in both species, there is debate on whether the homologue found in M. maripaludis, MMP1423, can perform the same first step in assembly since the initial sugar of the glycan, GalNAc, is different. In the case of the M. maripaludis tetrasaccharide glycan, two of the predicted four glycosyl transferases (MMP1079 and MMP1080, responsible for attachment of the 2 nd and 3 rd sugar) have been found (Van Dyke et al., 2009). The fourth glycosyl transferase of M. maripaludis has not been identified. Similar advances have also been made in studies of glycan assembly in H. volcanii, where glycosyl transferases (AglD, AglE, AglF, AglG and AlgI) have been identified (Abu-Qarn et al., 2007;Abu-Qarn et al., 2008 andYourist-Doutsch et al., 2008).\n\nCurrently, the archaeal flippase remains unidentified with only a handful of genes considered strong candidates. However in these cases, either the gene could not be deleted or the gene knockout did not have the expected phenotype of a flippase mutant (Chaban et al., 2006;Van Dyke et al., 2009). On the other hand, the oligosaccharyl transferase, AglB, was easily identified in all organisms since the archaeal transferase is an obvious homologue of the Stt3p protein used by both eukaryotes and bacteria (Chaban et al., 2006;Van Dyke et al., 2009).\n\nIn eukaryotes, deficiencies in N-glycosylation are lethal and the glycan likely plays a role in protein function, transport, folding, sorting and for localization. In bacteria where N-linked glycosylation is rare, O-linked glycans are frequently observed on their structures (Messner, 2004). In archaea, N-glycosylation likely occurs throughout the domain although thus far only a few species including H. volcanii, H. salinarum, M. voltae and M. maripaludis, have been definitely shown to contain N-glycosylated proteins. The latter three organisms are flagellated and N-linked glycans can be found on their flagellin proteins as well as the S-layer protein that comprise their cell wall (Logan, 2006). H. volcanii is not flagellated but possesses N-linked glycoproteins as its S-layer cell wall (Abu-Qarn et al., 2008b). A function of the N-linked glycan was demonstrated in a H. volcanii non-glycosylated mutant strain. These cells grew significantly less in elevated salt conditions due to a disrupted S-layer caused by the lack N-linked glycan (Abu-Qarn et al., 2007). Similarly, in both M. voltae and M. maripaludis glycosyl transferase mutants, a partial loss of glycan resulted in deficient flagella motility or loss of assembled flagella, indicating that a truncated glycan leads to defective motility and a minimum two sugar glycan is needed for flagella assembly to occur (Chaban et al., 2006;VanDyke et al., 2009). In another M. maripaludis study, an acetyl transferase gene needed for the complete biosynthesis of the second monosaccharide in the glycan was deleted. In addition to the detrimental effects on flagella assembly, this mutant had an unexpected pilus phenotype. Unattached pili were observed in the growth media indicating that cells were able to export and assemble pili, but were defective in the attachment of the pili to the cell (VanDyke et al., 2008). This suggests a different role for glycosylation (either N-linked or O-linked, since the second monosaccharide could potentially be used in both pathways) where the glycan is involved in the attachment and anchoring of extracellular structures.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to complete the identification of the proteins required for assembly of the N-linked glycan in M. maripaludis. Currently, only the Stt3p transferase homologue and two of the four potential glycosyl transferases have been discovered, while the identification of the flippase remains elusive.\n\nThe first goal was to identify the glycosyl transferase responsible for attaching the fourth sugar on the tetrasaccharide glycan by using in-frame deletion techniques that were previously established (Moore and Leigh, 2005). In-frame deletions have advantages over more traditional methods, such as insertional inactivation, because any single gene can be studied, regardless of its location within an operon. Furthermore, mutant strains can be complemented by returning the deleted gene via plasmid. Immunoblotting against flagellin proteins was used to determine if any reduction in molecular weight occurred due to interference in assembly of the complete glycan caused by the deletion of the targeted gene. Motility of the mutant was assessed by using semiswarm plates and effects on flagella assembly detected through electron microscopy.\n\nThe second objective was to identify the glycosyl transferase attaching GalNAc to the dolichol lipid. As previously mentioned, MMP1423 cannot be deleted because of its presumed involvement in co-factor B production. This gene's function is to attach GlcNAc to a dolichol lipid, as reported in M. voltae and S. cerevisiae, and was initially believed to do the same in M.\n\nmaripaludis. However with recent NMR and mass spectrometry data, the linking sugar in the M. maripaludis glycan was identified as GalNAc, not GlcNAc, so the role of MMP1423 in the M.\n\nmaripaludis N-linked pathway can be questioned. Deletion of the remaining annotated glycosyl transferases was attempted in hopes of identifying a novel N-linked glycosyl transferase or to deduce the function of MMP1423 by eliminating all other possibilities.\n\nThe third goal of this study was to identify the elusive flippase. With a limited number of candidates, several deletion techniques, including in-frame and insertional inactivation, were attempted on a gene believed to be a strong flippase candidate due to its proximity to known Nlinked genes and its annotation as a surface polysaccharide biosynthesis protein. A flippase mutant would be expected to contain non-glycosylated flagellin proteins which can readily be verified by immunoblotting techniques and mass spectrometry.\n\nThe last goal of the study was to begin to identify genes believed to be involved in the biosynthesis and modification of the unusual sugars of the N-linked glycan as this aspect of the glycan assembly has thus far been overlooked in archaea.\n\nThis study aimed to further the understanding of the archaeal N-glycosylation system by reaching these four goals.\n\nChapter 2\n\nEscherichia coli and Methanococcus maripaludis strains used in this study are shown in\n\nTable 2.1. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid cloning while M. maripaludis MM900 was used for markerless in-frame deletion of targeted genes. M. maripaludis MM900 originated from the wild-type Methanococcus maripaludis S2, but is missing the MMP0145 gene, which encodes for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hpt) protein. As a result, M. maripaludis MM900 is resistant to the toxic nucleotide base analogue, 8-azahypoxanthine (Moore and Leigh, 2005).\n\npCRPrtNeo is a 6.54 kb plasmid with encoded ampicillin and neomycin resistance and is shown in Figure 2.1 (Moore and Leigh, 2005). The vector also contains the M. maripaludis hpt gene, MMP0145. pCRPrtNEO cannot replicate in M. maripaludis and is used to introduce the inframe deletion fragment to initiate the marker-less deletion process (Moore and Leigh, 2005).

All M. maripaludis plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 2.2. 2.3 Media and Growth Conditions E. coli cultures were grown in liquid (with shaking at 120 rpm) and solid Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37°C. Solid plates require the addition of 15 g/L of agar. Ampicillin (100 µg/ml) was used for selection, when required. M. maripaludis cultures were grown anaerobically, overnight with gentle shaking (100 rpm) at 30°C in Balch media III under an atmosphere of CO 2 /H 2 (20:80). See Appendix Bfor Balch medium, III composition. The transformation protocol for markerless gene deletion in MM900 requires the use of McCas media rather than Balch III medium (See Appendix B for McCas composition). In McCas medium, yeast extract and pepticase that are present in Balch III are replaced with casamino acids which, is necessary for the 8-azahypoxanthine selection step to work. Plates of McCas agar media (standard McCas with 20 g of Noble agar) are used for single colony isolation and 8-\n\nazahypoxanthine selection (240 µg/ml). Selection using 8-azahypoxanthine does not occur when using less purified types of agar. Neomycin is used at a concentration of 1 mg/ml when required.\n\nComplementation of deleted genes in M. maripaludis required nitrogen-free media (Blank et al., 1995) (See Appendix B for recipe). Puromycin (2.5 µg/ml) is used for complementation plasmid selection.\n\nAll plasmid cloning was performed with E. coli subcloning efficiency DH5α chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). Occasionally TOPO cloning kits (Invitrogen) were used to clone PCR products prior to subcloning into the appropriate M. maripaludis vectors. Transformation of plasmids into DH5α cells used the method recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).\n\nTable 2.2: Plasmids used in this study Plasmid Description Source or Reference pCRPrtNeo hmv promoter-hpt fusion + Neo R cassette in pCR2.1Topo, Amp R Moore and Leigh, 2005 pKJ741 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP90 This study pKJ703 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP356 This study pKJ709 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP359 This study pKJ750 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP590 This study pKJ737 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1293 This study pKJ739 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1294 This study pKJ665 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1088 This study pKJ685 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1089 This study pKJ713 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1088/MMP1089 This study pKJ735 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1081 This study pKJ751 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1082 This study pKJ757 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of MMP1083 This study pKJ721 pCRPrtNeo with in-frame deletion of FlaJ This study pPAC60 phmvA promoter + Pur R cassette Thomas et al., 2001 pKJ693 pPAC60 with truncated MMP1089 This study pHW40 nif promoter-lacZ fusion + Pur r cassette, Amp r Obtained from J.

After a 1 hour recovery at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm), cells were plated onto LB plates with ampicillin (100µg/mL) and grown overnight. For TOPO cloning, the plates also contained X-gal (40 µg/mL) to distinguish transformants containing vector with insert (white colonies) from vector alone (blue colonies). Single colonies are picked and grown overnight for screening. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli with QIAprep ® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes.\n\nAgarose (0.8%) gels containing ethidium bromide (0.00003%) were ran in TAE Buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% glacial acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA) (Maniatis et al., 1982) to visualize DNA in the presence of UV light.\n\nMost restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB) or Fermentas and DNA was digested using their recommended buffers.\n\nRapid Ligation Kits (Fermentas) and protocol were used for all DNA ligations and vector cloning.\n\nChromosomal DNA was isolated from desired M. maripaludis strains using a previously described protocol (Gernhardt et al., 1990). Briefly, 10mL of culture were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 rpm to recover cells. Cells are then resuspended in 600 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) which causes the cells to partially lyse. Further cell lysis is induced by the addition of 6 µL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) stock. Incubation with 4 µl of RNase (60 µg/mL, Fermentas) at 37°C for 1 hr, followed by 8 µl of Proteinase K (230 µg/mL, Fermentas) digestion at 55°C for 45 minutes allows for degradation of the RNA and proteins, respectively. DNA is initially extracted with phenol:chloroform (1:1 ratio) twice, followed by a final extraction with only chloroform. DNA was precipitated with 95% ethanol and stored in distilled water (dH 2 0).\n\nPrimers used for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are shown in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.\n\nA standard PCR 50 µl reaction requires: 40.5 µl of dH 2 0, 5 µl of 10X Polymerase Thermobuffer (New England Biolabs), 1 µL each of forward and reverse primer (50 pmol), 1 µl dNTP mix (0.8 mM), 0.5 µl Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 1 µl of DNA template. PCR reactions tubes are then placed in a Mastercycler epgradient S (Eppendorf) and generally undergo the following cycle: 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, primer annealing temperature of 55°C for 45 seconds and 72°C extension time based on 1 kb extension per minute. Primer annealing temperatures varied in some reactions because a gradient was used to optimize the amount and specificity of the desired PCR product. The PCR reaction then finishes with a final extension time of 10 minutes at 72°C to ensure completion of all reactions.\n\nTransformation of pCRPrtNeo deletion plasmids and pHW40 complementation plasmids into M. maripaludis was performed under anaerobic conditions according to the methodologies reported in previous studies (Tumbula et al., 1994). Briefly, 5 mL of M. maripaludis overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh media and grown for 1-2 hours at 37°C to allow cells to enter log phase. Cells were then harvested anaerobically by centrifuging 5 mL of the log phase culture Table 2.3: Deletion primers used in this study Name Sequence (5`to 3`) Restriction Site (Underlined) MMP090_For_Up CGGATCCGAGTTTGAAGATTACGCATACG BamHI MMP090_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCAGGTGCTGCATAGTGGCTGTGG AscI MMP090_For_Down TGGCGCGCCTGAATCGATAGTTGCTTGTG AscI MMP090_Rev_Down CGGATCCCAGTTCTTGCTCTCTGTCC BamHI MMP356_For_Up CGGATCCCATACCGGCCAGCACTATGAC BamHI MMP356_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCAAGAATTGTAATGTGGCGC AscI MMP356_For_Down TGGCGCGCCTTAAATCTATATTCTACCG AscI MMP356_Rev_Down CGGATCCGCCAAACAAACGGATAATACGAG BamHI MMP359_For_Up CGGATCCATATGTACTGGCCGATTATCC BamHI MMP359_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCTAGCGAGTAGTATCATAGAACC AscI MMP359_For_Down TGGCGCGCCCCGGTATTACACGGATTGGGAG AscI MMP359_Rev_Down CGGATCCACCATAAATGACGTACTATCG BamHI MMP590_For_Up CGGATCCCAGTATTAGTCCTCATAAGC BamHI MMP590_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCCATCGTCTACGACAATCACATC AscI MMP590_For_Down TGGCGCGCCATTGACTACCACAACGATGC AscI MMP590_Rev_Down CGGATCCCTGAAGGCGATTTAGATGCTG BamHI MMP1081_For_Up CGGGATCCAGATACGGAGATATTGAAG BamHI MMP1081_Rev_Up ATGGCGCGCCGTCAGTCATGTCCATAATGC AscI MMP1081_For_Down ATGGCGCGCCAGCGGAAGCATTAGGACAG AscI MMP1081_Rev_Down CGGGATCCGAACTCCATAGATGTTATCC BamHI MMP1082_For_Up ATCGGGATCCTGGCGTAGACAGTACTTATGTAGC BamHI MMP1082_Rev_Up ATCGGCGCGCCCCATTCCATAATCAATTATTGC AscI MMP1082_For_Down ATCGGCGCGCCTATGGAGTTCAATTTCATCCTG AscI MMP1082_Rev_Down ATCGGGATCCGGAGCAATATTAATCTCCTCTCGG BamHI MMP1083_For_Up ATCGGGATCCCTAGAGCGGAAGCATTAGGACAG BamHI MMP1083_Rev_Up ATCGGCGCGCCGGATCACCTATATAATTTGGATC AscI MMP1083_For_Down ATCGGCGCGCCATCCGAGAGGAGATTAATATTGCTCC AscI MMP1083_Rev_Down ATCGGGATCCTGGTTATGCTGGCGATGCAGTGG BamHI MMP1088_For_Up CGGATCCGCCGTAGGTATGAAAGTGTC BamHI MMP1088_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCTCTTGTCGGGATAACATGGGGT AscI MMP1088_For_Down TGGCGCGCCGATATCTCCTAATCTATTAGC AscI MMP1088_Rev_Down CGGATCCGGTATGCCGATAATGTTTGG BamHI MMP1089_For_Up GCTCTAGAGGTTGTAGAGAATATATGTG XbaI MMP1089_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCAACCAATTGGGGCCGCCAA AscI MMP1089_For_Down TGGCGCGCCATAAAATCAATGATTCTC AscI MMP1089_Rev_Down GCTCTAGACCTGTGGATACGTTGCAGCA XbaI MMP1088/1089_For_Up GCTCTAGAGCCGTAGGTATGAAAGTGTC XbaI MMP1088/1089_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCCTGCAACGTATCCACAGGGCC AscI MMP1088/1089_For_Down TGGCGCGCCAACTAGCACCCTTTATCATTCG AscI MMP1088/1089_Rev_Down GCTCTAGACCTGTGGATACGTTGCAGCA XbaI MMP1089_For_Dis GCGAATTCGATGGAACGAAAGCATTGCT EcoRI MMP1089_Rev_Dis GCGAATTCAAAGTAGTAGCAAATGCTGC EcoRI MMP1293_For_Up ATAGGATCCCAGCTATCAAGCTG BamHI MMP1293_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCTCTGGAAGGTCGTAGCCGACAG AscI MMP1293_For_Down TGGCGCGCCATACGAAATACAGCTGGGATGC AscI MMP1293_Rev_Down CGGATCCAGCTGGTAGAAGTCTTCGTGG BamHI MMP1294_For_Up CGGATCCCTTGCAACAACAGGAGTTCC BamHI MMP1294_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCCGCTATTGTCGGTGTTAATG AscI MMP1294_For_Down TGGCGCGCCCGACAGTTCTGAACGATACAG AscI MMP1294_Rev_Down CGGATCCCAGAGCTGTCCGTACCACATTCC BamHI FlaJ_For_Up CGGATCCTGTAGATGGTTCCTTGCCTG BamHI FlaJ_Rev_Up TGGCGCGCCGACCAACCGAGTGTAGCCTG AscI FlaJ_For_Down TGGCGCGCCGGATGGAGGACACTACCAGG AscI FlaJ_Rev_Down CGGATCCCAAGCTCCATTGCATCAAGC BamHI 38 Table 2.4: Primers used in PCR screens for detecting gene deletions Name Sequence (5' to 3') MMP090_For_Seq AATATAGTTGATCCGTTAGC MMP090_Rev_Seq CCTCACAGCATGCAGGAACTATC MMP356_For_Seq TCTCCTGTCGGATACCTAG MMP356_Rev_Seq GGTTCCTGTTGTAGTTATGG MMP359_For_Seq CACTATTGCAATACTGAGTCC MMP359_Rev_Seq CAATACATCTGAAGGTAGTG MMP590_For_Seq CAACTTCAACAGAAGCACTAGCGG MMP590_Rev_Seq AAGGATGCTCCCAACAGAAACG MMP1081_For_Seq GATGCAGTATGCCATTTGAG MMP1081_Rev_Seq TCATTGGTTATAATAGCGTC MMP1082_For_Seq CTAGAGCGGAAGCATTAGGACAG MMP1082_Rev_Seq TATCATTGAATATCCTGACTGC MMP1083_For_Seq TCGAAGGATAACATCTATGGAG Table 2.5: Primers used to create the complementation plasmids Name Sequence (5' to 3') Restriction Site (Underlined) MMP1081_For_Comp CCAATGCATGGTTCAAAAAATATGTAAAAGATGCATTAT GG NsiI MMP1081_Rev_Comp GCTCTAGATTAGTGATGGTGGTGATGATGGTAAACCCTT ATTTTTTTATATGTTTCTC XbaI MMP1088_For_Comp CCAATGCATGAATGTATTTAAAACGCTGGT Nsi MMP1088_Rev_Comp GCTCTAGATTAGTGATGGTGGTGATGATGGGAGATATCA TTATATATG XbaI McCas media and subcultured overnight without selection. Cells were then grown in the presence of either neomycin (pCRPrtNeo) or puromycin (pHW40) to select for transformants with the plasmid.\n\nMarkerless in-frame deletion constructs were created for the double recombination deletion methodology as previously developed by Moore and Leigh (2005). Primers amplify two 1 kb DNA fragments, upstream and downstream of the targeted gene. The upstream fragment still contains the start codon of the gene while the downstream fragment includes the stop codon. The two fragments are ligated through the introduced AscI restriction site contained within the primers. The ligated product has the DNA sequence that reads in-frame from the start codon to the stop (with the majority of the gene missing) and when cloned in the vector, pCRTprNeo, integrates into the genome to initiate the in-frame deletion following transformation.\n\npCRPrtNeo is a non-replicating plasmid that must integrate in the chromosomal DNA of M. maripaludis to render the cells neomycin resistant (Neo R ). The pCRPrtNeo vector also encodes the hpt gene, which will allow for selection of desired genotypes during the deletion process. After transformation of the vector into M. maripaludis, neomycin selects for the first recombination, where the vector integrates into the chromosome. The neomycin resistant cells are then allowed to grow without any antibiotic. This provides the opportunity for the vector to recombine out of the chromosome where the recombination event can either return the wildtype genotype or the deletion sequence that was introduced with pCRPrtNeo (Figure 2.2). To select for this recombination, cells were plated on solid McCas media with the toxic base analog, 8azahypoxanthine, since cells that still contain pCRPrtNeo have the hpt gene and are susceptible to 8-azahypoxanthine. Single colonies were picked and screened by PCR for deletion mutants.\n\nSequencing primers were used to amplify over the targeted gene with deletion mutants producing a smaller PCR product than wildtype cells because of the missing gene.\n\nDeletion strains were complemented with the appropriate wildtype gene, which was cloned into the vector, pHW40, containing the nif promoter. The cloned gene is amplified using a forward primer that must include the restriction enzyme NsiI cleavage site (5' ATGCAT 3'),\n\nwhere the second AT begins at the ATG of the start codon of the gene. The restriction enzyme cleavage site incorporated into the reverse primer may be that of MluI, XbaI or BglII. However in this study only XbaI (5' TCTAGA 3') was used.\n\nCloned genes in pHW40 were transformed back into their respective deletion strains.\n\nPuromycin (2.5 ug/mL) was used to select transformants and these were subsequently cultured in nitrogen free media, supplemented with either alanine or NH 4 Cl. Under alanine conditions, the nif-promoter is turned on and results in gene expression. Alternatively, using NH 4 Cl as the sole nitrogen gene does not induce gene expression (Lie and Leigh, 2002).\n\nSouthern blotting protocols were performed using previously established methods (Thomas et al., 2001). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested overnight with the desired restriction enzyme and electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel for 1.5 hours at 100 V. After denaturing and DNA transfer to positively charged nylon membrane by capillary transfer, the blot was blocked with prehybridization solution for 1 hour before hybridization overnight with a DNA probe (55°C). DNA probes were 400-500 bp PCR products that were amplified across the mutant gene region using sequencing primers and subsequently DIG labeled using a DIG labeled kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche). Bound probe were detected with Antidigoxigenin-AP (Roche) and developed using CSPD Star (Roche).\n\nRNA was extracted from M. maripaludis MM900 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RT-primers (Table 2.6) designed to amplify across the intergenic region were used with the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR reaction mixes were prepared according to manufacturer, and were placed in a Mastercycler epgradient S (Eppendorf) to undergo the following program: initial incubations at 50°C for 30 minutes and 95°C for 15 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 50 seconds. An additional extension time of 2 minutes at 72°C completed the RT-PCR reaction. Controls PCR reactions on the RNA template lacking the reverse transcriptase step served as controls for potential DNA contamination.\n\nWhole cell or crude-membrane protein samples were boiled with 2xESB (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromophenol blue) for 10 minutes and loaded to a 15% acrylamide gel (Laemmli, 1970). A semi dry blotter (Trans Blot-SD, Biorad) was used to transfer the proteins to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) as previously described (Towbin et al., 1979). Polyclonal chicken antibody to M. voltae FlaB2,\n\nshown to cross react with M. maripaludis flagellins (Van Dyke et al., 2008), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken immunoglobulin Y (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Chemiluminescence kits (Roche) were used to develop the blots.\n\nM. maripaludis flagella were extracted according to protocol previously established by Bardy et al., (2002). 8 L of M. maripaludis cells were harvested via centrifugation (6000 x g for 15 min) and resuspended in 10mM Tris-HCl; pH 7 + 2% NaCl. OP-10 detergent (1% final concentration; Nikko Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to lyse cells. DNase and RNase were added with an incubation time of 30 minutes at room temperature, with occasional inverting to reduce viscosity. After centrifugation (6000 x g for 15 min), the supernatant was incubated on ice (1 hr) with the addition of 1M NaCl + 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG8000) solution (1/10 volume). After another centrifugation (7000 x g for 20 minutes), pellets were resuspended in distilled water, loaded to a KBr gradient (0.5 g/mL) and centrifuged (35K rpm for 47 18 hours using an SW-41 rotor). A white band, corresponding to isolated flagella was removed, diluted with dH 2 O and re-centrifuged (30K for 90 min using an SW-41 rotor). The final flagella pellet is resuspended in dH 2 O. Samples were sent for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (Dr.\n\nSusan Logan, NRC, Ottawa).\n\nPurified flagellins (Bardy et al., 2002) were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega Madison, WI) at a ratio of 30:1 (protein: enzyme, v/v) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C.\n\nThe protein digest was analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS using a Q Tof Ultima hybrid quadropole time of flight mass spectrometer as previously described (Twine et al., 2008;Kelly et al.,2009).\n\nGlycopeptide spectra were examined manually to determine the glycan structure present.\n\nM. maripaludis cells were centrifuged and washed with 1X PBS and resuspended in 50 mM MgSO 4 . Cells were transferred on Formvar-coated gold grids and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid. Grids were viewed using a Hitachi H-700 electron microscope (at 75 kV).\n\nChapter 3\n\nPrevious work had reported the role of two glycosyl transferase genes, MMP1079 and MMP1080, which attach the second and third sugars of the tetrasaccharide glycan in M.\n\nmaripaludis (VanDyke et al., 2009). The first sugar in the M. maripaludis glycan is GalNAc, which differs from the GlcNAc seen in M. voltae (Kelly et al., 2009). While the glycosyl transferase for the first sugar in M. voltae is AglH, it may not carry out this function in M.\n\nmaripaludis. However, since it is not possible to knock out this gene in either M. voltae or M. maripaludis, due to its proposed role in biosynthesis of the essential methanogenic cofactor B, the role of the AglH homologue in M. maripaludis (MMP1423) cannot be genetically tested directly.\n\nThe activity of AglH in M. voltae was indirectly proven when it was demonstrated to complement the eukaryote, S. cerevisiae, carrying a conditional lethal mutation in alg7, an Nacetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase responsible for attaching GlcNAc in the N-linked system (Shams-Eldin et al., 2008).\n\nPotentially, the first glycosyl transferase may not be MMP1423. Therefore, in-frame deletions were attempted on the remaining annotated glycosyl transferases that were not yet investigated to identify the potential first glycosyl transferases (Table 3.1). Deletion of MMP1170 was previously unsuccessfully attempted by VanDyke et al. (2009).\n\nFinally, the gene encoding the fourth glycosyl transferase has yet to be identified. An annotated glycosyl transferase gene, MMP1088, was a good candidate for an in-frame deletion since it is located in the same gene region as MMP1079 and MMP1080.\n\nUp and down deletion arms for MMP1088 were created via two PCR reactions using primer pairs: MMP1088_For_UP/MMP1088_Rev_Up and\n\nTable 3.1: Annotated glycosyl transferases in the M. maripaludis genome.

MMP1079 and MMP1080 are responsible for attaching the second and third sugars, respectively, while MMP1424 transfers the N-linked glycan to the side chain of asparagine residues within the N-linked sequon.

PCR of wildtype cells amplifies a 1.4 kb PCR product. PCR of mutant cells amplifies a 150 bp product. B) Southern blot analysis of wildtype (wt) and ∆MMP1088 (∆) genomic DNA. DNA was digested with EcoR1 and PvuII and hybridized with a DIG labelled probe that binds in the targeted gene region. For wildtype DNA, the probe binds to the predicted 2088 bp sized DNA fragment whereas in the mutant, the predicted 856 bp fragment is bound. M represents lanes with the 1 kb ladder (NEB).\n\n∆MMP1079 and ∆MMP1424 flagellins have glycans of 4 sugars, 2 sugars, 1 sugar and no sugars.\n\nWestern blot analysis revealed that ∆MMP1088 flagellins migrated at a lower molecular weight than wildtype and higher molecular weight than flagellins from any of the other deletion strains.\n\nIn comparison to the known glycosyl transferases, there is a stepwise decrease in molecular weight from wildtype, starting with ∆MMP1088 flagellins and progressing to the completely nonglycosylated ∆MMP1423 flagellins (Figure 3.3).\n\n∆MMP1088 and wildtype cells were viewed under the electron microscope to determine if flagella assembly had been affected. The ∆MMP1088 cells were fully flagellated and showed no striking differences from wildtype cells (Figure 3.4).\n\nMotility of the ∆MMP1088 mutant was assessed with respect to wildtype and other glycosyl transferase deletion strains using 0.25% agar semi-swarm plates. Cells were inoculated at the center of 0.25% agar semi swarm plates and grown for 9 days at 30°C. The diameter of the swarm area correlates to effectiveness in motility. It was found that ∆MMP1088 was consistently less motile in this assay than wildtype cells, but more so than ∆MMP1080 calls when the diameters of the swarm were measured. ∆MMP1079 and ∆MMP1424 cells showed no motility because they lack flagella since a minimum 2 sugar glycan is needed for proper assembly of flagella (VanDyke et al., 2009) (Figure 3.5).\n\nThe MMP1088 gene was complemented back into ∆MMP1088 to confirm the effects of the deletion. Genes cloned into the complementation vector, pHW40, are controlled through a nif promoter. This promoter is repressed in the presence of NH 4 Cl but moderately induced in N-free media where alanine is supplemented as the sole nitrogen source (Lie and Leigh, 2002).\n\nTo begin cloning into pHW40, MMP1088 (1232 bp) was amplified using the primers  wt Δ1088 Δ1080 Δ1079 Δ1424\n\nFlagella were purified from ∆MMP1088 cells and sent for MS analysis of the attached Nlinked glycan in the laboratory of Dr. Susan Logan (NRC Ottawa, ON). It was determined that the glycan was missing the last sugar and threonine usually found on the third sugar (Figure 3.7).\n\nAnalysis of the N-linked glycan from complemented ∆MMP1088 flagella saw a return of the glycan structure back to wildtype.\n\nThis set of data identified MMP1088 as the glycosyl transferase responsible for the transfer of the fourth sugar to the M. maripaludis N-linked glycan. This left only the first glycosyl transferase unaccounted for and the remaining genes annotated as glycosyl transferases were targeted for in-frame deletion in an attempt to identify this enzyme.

The amino acid sequence of this peptide is presented in the inset in (A) and the site of N-glycosylation is indicated. Some of the b and y fragment ions arising from fragmentation of the peptide bonds are indicated in the spectrum. The major carbohydrate oxonium ions are identified in the spectra using symbols to indicate the sugar residues present (GalNAc: 203 Da; (5S)-2-acetamido-2,4-dideoxy-α-Lerythro-hexos-5-ulo-1,5-pyranose 217 Da; ManNAc3NamA6: 257 Da; GlcNAc3NAcA: • 258 Da and ManNAc3NAmA6Thr: 358 Da). The MS/MS spectrum for the wild-type glycopeptide (panel a) is dominated by the glycan oxonium ions at m/z 617.2 (• + ) and m/z 359.1 ( ), although a weak ion signal for the intact WT glycan is observed at m/z 1037.4. MS/MS analysis of the equivalent glycopeptide from the 1088 mutant indicated the presence of a trimeric glycan composed of the GlcNAc ( ), GlcNAc3NAcA (•) and ManNAc3NAmA6 ( ) without the threonine modification.\n\nFor simplicity, complete data from only MMP359 will be shown in this section although MMP090, MMP356, MMP590, MMP1293 and MMP1294 were all tested as candidates for the first glycosyl transferase. Primers used for this study are listed in Table 2.1. The up and down arms of the in-frame deletion construct were obtained through two separate PCR reactions. The primers used in the up reaction were MMP359_For_Up and MMP359_Rev_Up while the down reaction had amplifying primers of MMP359_For_Down and MMP359_Rev_Down (Figure 3.8A). After purification of the up and down arms, PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme, AscI, overnight. The two arms were then ligated to create the 2kb deletion construct and amplified using the primers MMP359_For_Up and MMP359_Rev_Down (Figure 3.8B). The 2kb deletion product was digested with the restriction enzyme, BamHI, and cloned into the M. maripaludis vector, pCRPrtNeo (Figure 3.8C). The deletion pCRPrtNeo vector was subsequently named pKJ709.\n\npKJ709 was transformed into MM900 cells and cells incorporating the vector were selected with neomycin. These cells were then grown without any antibiotic, enabling the vector to recombine out. Single colonies were picked from agar plates containing 8-azahypoxanthine, grown in Balch III media and screened using whole cell PCR. The sequencing primers, MMP359_For_Seq and MMP359_Rev_Seq, were used to determine if cultures were either wildtype (1264 bp PCR product) or mutant (730 bp PCR product), while the same was determined for MMP590, MMP1293 and MMP1294 (Figure 3.9). With the exception of MMP090 and MMP356, all deletions could be created. Whole cell PCR screens were performed at two steps within the transformation protocol to demonstrate that a) the pCRPrtNeo vector had integrated in the genome (cells taken from neomycin cultures) and b) recombination after 8azahypoxanthine selection occurred so as to generate gene deletion mutants, before plating and single colony isolation. In the case of MMP090, a PCR band corresponding to the deletion construct could be detected in cells grown with neomycin, but not after 8-azahypoxanthine selection, indicating that recombination into the mutant genotype is extremely rare or not possible (Figure 3.9E) and thus providing a possible explanation for why screens of individual 8azahypoxanthine colonies were always wildtype.\n\nWestern blotting revealed that there was no change in the apparent molecular weight of the flagellins of ΔMMP359 in comparison to wildtype, indicating that the ∆MMP359 flagellins appear fully glycosylated. Similarly, no changes in molecular weight of the flagellins in strains deleted for MMP590, MMP1293 and MMP1294 were observed (Figure 3.10). These results would appear to eliminate the MMP359, MMP590, MMP1293 and MMP1294 genes as potential candidates for encoding the first glycosyl transferase.

Blots developed with anti-flagellin antibodies and bars indicates molecular weight marker (M).\n\nThe flippase protein has yet to be identified in any archaeal N-linked system. BLAST searches for homologues of the possible eukaryotic flippase, Rft1, in the M. maripaludis genome did not reveal any protein that was considered related based on the Expected (E) values given by the BLAST engine. On the other hand, similar searches for homologues of the bacterial ATPdependent flippase gene in the M. maripaludis genome produced too many strong hits (some of which are clearly not flippase candidates) because of the conserved nature of ABC-type transporters. This makes the search for the actual flippase difficult. A deletion of the flippase gene should be possible given that a mutant for the oligosaccharyl transferase, which processes the glycan after the flippase in the N-linked pathway, has been constructed. A lethal flippase deletion would indicate that the protein is involved in another cellular process that is essential. In this work, the MMP1089 gene was targeted for in-frame deletion as an N-linked flippase candidate, because it is located immediately downstream of the fourth glycosyl transferase, MMP1088, and is annotated as a polysaccharide biosynthesis gene that has BLAST hits to ABCtransporters.\n\nA deletion construct for MMP1089 was created and cloned in pCRPrtNeo as for the other genes. The pCRPrtNeo deletion vector was named pKJ685 (Figure 3.11A).\n\nAfter transformation of pKJ685 into MM900, single colonies on hypoxanthine plates were picked and screened by PCR using primers, 1089_For_Seq and 1089_Rev_Seq. Only wildtype transformants were obtained in screens of over 80 single colonies (Figure 3.12A).\n\nWhole cell PCR of M. maripaludis grown in neomycin indicates that pKJ685 had integrated in the chromosome (Figure 3.12B).\n\nSince the conventional in-frame deletion attempt to delete MMP1089 was unsuccessful, a second approach was taken, where the integration vector, pPAC60, was used. This method was considered a plausible alternative because MMP1089 is the last gene in its operon therefore, a disruption will not have any downstream effects.\n\nN-and C-terminally truncated MMP1089 (900 bp) was obtained though PCR using the primers, MMP1089_For_Dis and MMP1089_Rev_Dis. The truncated MMP1089 product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the pPAC60 vector (Figure 3.11B). The vector was named pKJ693.\n\nTransformed MM900 cells with incorporated pKJ693 were selected with puromycin.\n\nPCR screening (MMP1089_For_Seq and MMP1089_Rev_Seq) of single colonies revealed cells that only had a wildtype sized MMP1089 (Figure 3.12C). No PCR product is expected for cells carrying the disrupted gene since the primers would be amplifying across a very large region that includes the pPAC60 vector and its insert. Over 50 colonies were screened indicating that the vector must have inserted elsewhere within the genome and the gene is likely essential. No attempt was made to identify the location of the inserted plasmid.\n\nHowever, for a final attempt, the conventional in-frame deletion protocol was performed again. Unlike the previous work where MMP1089 was the only gene targeted for deletion, this attempt included the deletion of the MMP1088 gene. In several other previous gene deletions, the final recombination event was found to be heavily favoured towards wildtype, where frequencies such as one mutant in every fifty colonies are found. This may be a result of primer design and recombination hot spots throughout the M. maripaludis genome. Therefore, the previously deleted region of MMP1088 is included in a final attempt to delete MMP1089 since the role of MMP1088 was now known and would not complicate interpretation of the desired gene deletion.\n\nThe deletion construct for MMP1088/MMP1089 was created and cloned into pCRPrtNeo.\n\nThe vector is called pKJ713 (Figure 3.11C).\n\npKJ713 was transformed into MM900 cells and single colonies were screened by PCR after antibiotic selection was used according to the standard protocol. Initial screening with primers, MMP1088_For_Seq and MMP1089_For_Seq, revealed a potential mutant (Figure 3.12D).\n\nWestern blotting analysis of the putative ∆MMP1088/MMP1089 strain showed that the flagellin molecular weight did not change from wild type (Figure 3.13).

The linking sugar to the protein is Nacetylgalactosamine to which is attached a di-acetylated glucuronic acid followed by an acetylated and acetamidino modified mannuronic acid, which also includes threonine residue attachment. The final sugar is a very unusual diglycoside of aldulose, the first reported natural occurrence of this sugar. In previous work by VanDyke and work in this study, three glycosyl transferases, MMP1079, MMP1080 and MMP1088, were identified to be involved in the assembly of the M. maripaludis N-linked glycan (VanDyke et al., 2009). Lying between MMP1080 and MMP1088 were additional genes annotated as possibly involved in sugar biosynthesis and these were targeted for deletion in this section of the thesis. BLAST searches of MMP1081 reveal hits to enzymes responsible for attachment of acetamidino groups. Since the third sugar in the M. maripaludis glycan is a mannuronic acid with such a group, the defect in a potential MMP1081 mutant may be in the attachment of this acetamidino group. The final two genes in the operon, MMP1082 and MMP1083, have unusual annotations and their function cannot be easily predicted. Nevertheless, these two genes were also targeted for in-frame deletions because of their likelihood of co-transcription with MMP1081. RT-PCR was used to determine if in fact, these three genes are co-transcribed.\n\nCo -transcription was likely given that the start codon of MMP1082 was immediately adjacent to the stop codon of MMP1081 while the length of the intergenic region between ∆ wt ∆ wt ∆ wt M ∆ wt M 1 kb 500 bp 500 bp 1.5 kb ∆ wt M ∆ wt M Figure 3.17: Confirmation of MMP1081 deletion.

In this study a number of genes were deleted in an attempt to identify those involved in the biosynthesis and assembly of the four sugar glycan, important for flagella assembly and function in the archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis. Two genes involved in the biosynthesis of the M. maripaludis Nlinked glycan were identified. One of the genes plays a role in glycan assembly while the other is involved in the biosynthesis of one of the sugars that compose the glycan. In-frame deletions in both genes resulted in an altered glycan, as determined by immunoblotting and MS analysis, and consequently led to impairment of swimming motility, as shown by semi-swarm plate analysis.\n\nAlthough there are many exceptions, several Gram negative bacteria have been shown to glycosylate their flagellin proteins (e.g. Neisseria spp., Aeromonas spp., Helicobacter spp., Campylobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp.), while only three Gram positive genera have been reported to do so (Logan, 2006). Interestingly, there is some heterogeneity in the composition of the glycan within an individual organism for some species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while in others a single glycan is found on their flagellins, such as in Helicobacter pylori (Logan, 2006). The requirement of the glycan for assembly of flagella and motility also appears variable from species to species. Mutant strains in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli that had disrupted glycosylation pathways were non-flagellated and accumulated intracellular flagellins proteins with reduced molecular weight (Goon et al., 2003). Meanwhile within the Pseudomonas spp., glycosylation does not appear to be required for flagella assembly (Takeuchi et al., 2003;Schirm et al., 2004). With recent advancements in the sensitivity of mass spectrometers and NMR technology, detailed structures, including composition and linkage, from very small amounts of glycan can be obtained (Voisin et al., 2005).\n\nIn the case of bacterial flagellins and their glycans, thus far only O-linked sugars have been reported (Logan, 2006) but in Archaea only N-linked glycans have been found attached to flagellins. Previous studies demonstrated the requirement of glycosylation to archaeal flagellin proteins in M. voltae and M. maripaludis (Chaban et al., 2006;VanDyke et al., 2008;VanDyke et al., 2009). In these studies, reducing the wildtype glycan to two sugars or less disrupted flagella assembly causing the cells to become non-flagellated and subsequently non-motile (Chaban et al., 2006;VanDyke et al., 2009). Other mutations that left more than the two sugar minimum also affected motility, even though these cells could still assemble functional flagella (VanDyke et al., 2009).\n\nThe N-linked glycan structures for M. voltae, M. maripaludis and H. volcanii were reported to be a trisaccharide, tetrasaccharide and pentasaccharide, respectively (Chaban et al., 2006;Kelly et al., 2009;Yurist-Doutsch and Eichler, 2009). The glycans are assembled in the cytoplasm on a dolichol lipid embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane by glycosyl transferases.\n\nThe glycan is then flipped across the cytoplasmic membrane and attached to selective asparagine residues. MS analysis of the M. voltae glycan determined the structure to be β-ManpNAcA6Thr-\n\n(1-4)-β-GlcNAc3NAcA-(1-3)-β-GlcNAc (where GlcNAc is attached to the dolichol lipid or Asn residue), while M. maripaludis structure is Sug-4-β-ManNAc3NAmA6Thr-4-β-GlcNAc3NAcA-3-β-GalNAc (where the terminal Sug is a diglycoside of aldulose) (Voisin et al., 2005;Kelly et al., 2009). The specific glycan structure of H. volcanii is not known however, MS revealed that the pentasaccharide is composed of two hexoses, two hexuronic acids and an additional 190 Da saccharide (Abu-Qarn et al., 2007). In M. voltae, all the genes involved in the assembly of the trisaccharide glycan have been found. The first sugar, GlcNAc, is attached to the dolichol lipid by AglH. The function for this gene could not be proven directly through inactivation or deletion methods because of its involvement in the biosynthesis of cofactor B. In order to demonstrate the function of AglH, the gene was complemented into a conditional lethal strain of the eukaryote, S.\n\ncerevisiae, whose expression of the homologue of AglH, Alg7, can be controlled. Alg7 activity initiates the assembly of the eukaryotic N-linked glycan by attaching GlcNAc to the dolichol lipid embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum. Turning off the expression of Alg7 causes the cells to die because N-linked glycosylation is essential in eukaryotes. However, these cells were still viable when Alg7 expression was off if aglH was complemented into the cells, indicating that AglH could perform the same function as Alg7 and was most likely doing so in the M. voltae pathway. The remaining glycosyl transferases in M. voltae that attach the second and third sugar were identified through insertional inactivation experiments. In M. maripaludis, the development of in-frame deletion techniques has allowed for a more precise genetic study where any gene can be specifically targeted for deletion (rather than the multiple experiments that would be performed if inactivating a gene that is not the first or last gene of its operon) and returned through complementation. This has led to a similar characterization of the N-linked pathway in M. maripaludis, where the glycosyl transferases responsible for attaching the second and third sugar have been identified, while the first and last glycosyl transferases remained missing at the onset of this work. The flippase component is unidentified for the entire Archaeal domain.\n\nThe gene MMP1088 was targeted for in-frame deletion because of its potential role as one of the missing glycosyl transferase in the M. maripaludis N-linked pathway. Annotation and proximity to the second and third N-linked glycosyl transferases (MMP1079 and MMP1080, respectively) made MMP1088 an ideal candidate. Deletion of the MMP1088 gene resulted in a decrease in flagellin molecular weight that was between that observed for flagellins of wildtype and ∆MMP1080, indicating that the N-linked glycan had been altered but not to the extent of ∆MMP1080 (whose glycan only contains the full 2 sugars). Subsequently, MS analysis of purified ∆MMP1088 flagella confirmed that the N-linked glycan was missing the last sugar and unexpectedly, the threonine located on the third sugar. Complementation of the MMP1088 deletion returned the glycan structure to wildtype. Since the annotation of MMP1088 strongly suggests that the translated protein is a glycosyl transferase (based on conserved glycosyl transferase motifs), the role of MMP1088 is likely the addition of the fourth sugar of the tetrasaccharide N-linked glycan. This step would be required before the attachment of the threonine amino acid. On the other hand, without direct evidence of the function of MMP1088, such as in vitro biochemical analysis, the small possibility also remains that MMP1088 may be adding the threonine, which would then allow for the last sugar to be attached, most likely by another enzyme.\n\nIn this study, the six remaining glycosyl transferases (MMP090, MMP356, MMP359, MMP590, MMP1293 and MMP1294) annotated in the M. maripaludis genome that have not been the target of previous researchers, were targeted for in-frame deletion in hopes of identifying the first glycosyl transferase. Deletions were created in four of these genes (∆MMP359, ∆MMP590, ∆MMP1293 and ∆MMP1294), however western blot analysis revealed no apparent changes in flagellin molecular weight that would be expected of a deleted first glycosyl transferase. The remaining two genes (MMP090 and MMP356) could not be deleted because either recombination for the deletion construct is not favourable or these genes are involved in another pathway that is essential for the cells, such as an essential O-linked pathway or the biosynthesis of glycolipids.\n\nGeneral PCR screening of cell cultures grown in 8-azahypoxanthine before plating and single colony selection revealed no traces of a mutant sized product, suggesting that isolating a deletion mutant in these genes is unlikely. Given these results, there are now only four possible genes encoding the first glycosyl transferase, all of which appear to be lethal or unfavourable for deletion: MMP090, MMP356, the previously attempted MMP1170 and the MMP1423 gene that is likely involved in the biosynthesis of the essential cofactor B. Homologues of MMP1423 have been demonstrated to play the role of the first glycosyl transferase using M. voltae and the eukaryote S. cerevisiae, which is to add a GlcNAc monosaccharide to a dolichol lipid.\n\nExperimental confirmation on whether this protein has relaxed substrate specificity for both GlcNAc and GalNAc is needed. Eukaryotic glycosyl transferases are known for their strict substrate specificity, despite only subtle differences between the monosaccharide sugars. BLAST searches against MMP1088 revealed strong hits (E value of approximately 10 -74 ) to other glycosyl transferases in archaea such as Pyrococcus furiosus and other methanogens, as well as to other genes found within its own genome (MMP356). It is noteworthy that despite BLAST results\n\nindicating that MMP1088 and MMP356 are very similar glycosyl transferases, MMP356 must be performing a different function as it is unable to complement the MMP1088 deletion. However, there are rare examples of relaxed specificity among glycosyl transferases as well. It is reported that the β 1, 4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which is capable of transferring GalNAc moieties in addition to GlcNAc, although at much less efficient rates (Ikeda et al., 2000) Investigation of the relative concentrations of GlcNAc and GalNAc in the intracellular pool of M.\n\nvoltae and M. maripaludis would also be useful, and may explain the differences observed in the linking sugar of their N-linked glycan if GalNAc is the major sugar available for MMP1423 to transfer in M. maripaludis. Unfortunately, no such studies have been performed in any methanogen.\n\nA key component missing from the M. maripaludis and archaeal N-glycosylation pathway in general is the flippase protein that transfers the glycan from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to the periplasmic side. Earlier studies have targeted several potential candidates based on BLAST searches, gene location and annotation in M. maripaludis, M. voltae and H. volcanii without any success (VanDyke et al., 2009;Chaban et al., 2006;J. Eichler, personal communication to K. Jarrell). Although deletion of MMP1089 had already been previously attempted, this gene was the focus for deletion by a variety of methods in this study.\n\nThree different attempts, classical in-frame deletion, insertional inactivation and the deletion of MMP1089 along with a neighbouring gene that was known to be susceptible for deletion (MMP1088) were performed. However, these three attempts were unsuccessful and may indicate that the MMP1089 gene is essential for the cells. It is expected that a deletion of the gene encoding the flippase protein should be possible. The N-linked system is not essential in any of the archaeal species currently studied, since the Stt3p protein, whose action occurs at the last step in the pathway, has been deleted in M. voltae, M. maripaludis and H. volcanii (Chaban et al., 2006;VanDyke et al., 2009;Abu-Qarn and Eichler, 2006). The flippase would only be essential if it was involved in another process that is required by the M. maripaludis cells, such as in the case for MMP1423 and co-factor B. In both eukaryotes and bacteria, flippase proteins, Rft1 and PglK respectively, have been identified. The flippases are quite different, where PglK is an ABC transporter that utilizes ATP for its function while Rft1 appears to flip the glycan independently of ATP. Recently, the function of Rft1 has been disputed by Frank et al., (2008), who suggested that Rft1 merely acts as a critical accessory protein, but is not the flippase itself. However, that group was unable to identify the endoplasmic protein(s) that would be the flippase. The lack of data on any archaeal flippase and the difficulty in identifying obvious homologues to the N-linked flippases found in Bacteria and Eukarya may indicate that there is a novel archaeal protein that makes the N-linked glycosylation pathway in Archaea unique.\n\nGlycomics is the study of an organism's entire array of oligosaccharides and is considered an emerging field (Nahalka et al., 2007). With research similar to work done in this study, we are beginning to realize the diverse informative role that oligosaccharides and other carbohydrates can have on proteins. Whether oligosaccharides are involved in every day cellular processes such as cell signalling, protein sorting and assembly or in health and disease, such as autoimmune disorders and bacterial pathogenesis, the need to understand them is apparent (Alavi and Axford, 2008). Recent advancements in carbohydrate structural characterization with mass spectrometry, as well as the vast amount of data on biosynthetic enzymes such as glycosyltransferases, have led to the development of exciting techniques that allow for the synthesis of many carbohydrates. These tools will be particularly valuable for research, such as in the study of deoxysugars from plants, fungi and bacteria, which are now recognized to possess bioactivity and holds great potential for drug therapies through the glycosylation of antibiotics and novel anti-cancer drugs (Salas et al., 2005;Trefzer et al., 1999). Future pharmaceutical and vaccine related studies will have the opportunity to investigate the direct immune response to these oligosaccharides by obtaining a pure sample through its in vitro synthesis (Seeberger and Werz, 2007;Nalhalka et al., 2007). In another application, the interaction between two carbohydrates can also be tested through the use of carbohydrate arrays which can have implications for cell signalling, pathogenesis and cancer (Wu et al., 2009). At this time, only bacterial glycosyltransferases are being applied for in vivo and in vitro engineering of these natural carbohydrate moieties (Luzhetskyy and Bechthold, 2008). Many sugar modifications and glycosyl transferases are still unknown in Archaea, however, with their unique ability to survive in extreme environments, they most likely possess a diverse spectrum of oligosaccharides (Abu-Qarn et al., 2008). Identification of these novel sugars and enzymes (both biosynthetic and glycosyl transferases) will significantly enhance the oligosaccharide synthesis toolbox for future research and their applications.\n\nCurrently, our knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways of archaeal sugars is lacking.\n\nSugar biosynthesis can require many different types of enzymes such as methyltransferases, acetyltransferases and epimerases. While most of these enzymes and their role in biosynthetic pathways are known in eukaryotes and bacteria, their homologues in Archaea can utilize different substrates, making it difficult to assign gene function based on annotation alone (Namboori and Graham, 2008). Eukaryotic and bacterial studies have focused on the biosynthesis of acetamido sugars, especially GlcNAc and its derivatives, due to their prevalence in cell structure and function. Bacterial peptidoglycan possesses many cross-linked polysaccharides composed of GlcNAc and one of its derivatives, N-acetylmuramic acid (Ghuysen et al., 1984). Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria also contain N-acetylmannosaminuronate (ManNAcA) sugars in their capsule or lipopolysaccharides, respectively (Kawamura et al., 1979). In eukaryotes, the N-linked glycan contains several GlcNAc sugars with many proteins glycosylated with these sugars (Burda and Aebi, 1999;Zachara and Hart, 2006). Interestingly, bacteria and eukaryotes use a different biosynthetic pathway to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc (a precursor to GlcNAc), where only the initial step, glucosamine synthase converting fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) to α-D-glucosamine-6phosphate (GlcN-6-P), is conserved in both pathways (Namboori and Graham, 2008). In eukaryotes, acetyl-coenzyme A is used to acetylate GlcN-6-P before the phosphate group is transferred to the anomeric position of the sugar to form GlcNAc-1-P. The sugar is activated to form UDP-GlcNAc through the actions of a nucleotidyltransferase enzyme using UTP.\n\nAlternatively in bacteria, GlcN-6-P is converted to glucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcN-1-P) and uses a bifunctional enzyme to transfer the sugar to UTP before acetylation. In addition to the order of acetylation seen in bacteria, another notable difference occurs at the end of the bacterial pathway where UDP-GlcNAc has the potential to be further processed into UDP-Nacetylmannosaminuronate (UDP-ManNAcA) (Namboori and Graham, 2008). The two biosynthetic pathways and their enzymes are summarized in Figure 4.1.\n\nArchaea can also use GlcNAc sugars and its derivatives in their flagellin and S-layer proteins, and most likely in the biosynthesis of co-factor B (Chaban et al., 2006;Abu-Qarn and Eichler, 2006;White, 2001). Recently, the biosynthetic pathway of acetamido sugars in Methanococcales (M. maripaludis and M. jannaschii) was found to follow that of bacteria with many orthologues present in the archaeal genomes (Namboori and Graham, 2008). These genes were identified and characterized in both species through in vitro analysis where the universally conserved glucosamine synthase was encoded by MMP1160, MMP1077 converted GlcN-6-P to\n\nGlcN-1-P, while MJ1101 possessed both acetyltransferase and nucleotidyltransferase ability and  and flagella assembly were determined for ∆MMP1081 and ∆MMP1088 cells using semi-swarm agar plates and electron microscopy. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that both ∆MMP1081 and ∆MMP1088 cells had no apparent deficits in the amount of flagella on the cell surface.\n\nHowever, when motility was compared to the wildtype strain, deficiencies in motility were observed in both mutants. Interestingly, the completeness of the glycan is highly correlated to motility and is highlighted when comparing the motility of ∆MMP1081 and ∆MMP1088 cells.\n\nThe ∆MMP1081 glycan is nearly identical with the ∆MMP1088 glycan with the exception of a missing acetamidino functional group on the third sugar. However, ∆MMP1081 cells have a noticeable deficit in motility. In general, motility and completeness of glycan was found to occur in the following order (most motile to less motile; most complete glycan to least complete   93 by their signal peptidase, FlaK, and transported across the cytoplasmic membrane. Once the flagellin subunits are exposed in the periplasm, the Stt3p protein, MMP1424, transfers the Nlinked glycan from the dolichol carrier to select N-linked sequons (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid other than proline) within the flagellins before they are assembled at the base of the growing flagellum. The mechanism for targeting Asn residues within the N-linked sequon is currently unknown, but would provide valuable insight as to why some proteins known to be associated with the cytoplasmic membrane are glycosylated while others are not, even though they contain the required Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequon (Jones et al., 2005). In the case of M.\n\nmaripaludis, even within a single flagellin protein, all potential N-linked sites are not glycosylated, where the N 26 position in FlaB1 and FlaB2 are not glycosylated (Kelly et al., 2009).\n\nFuture work is needed to identify the archaeal flippase, although this task is proving to be quite challenging. Classical methods that use homology to bacterial and eukaryotes, gene annotation and function appear to be inadequate and new screening methods may be needed. If the flippase gene happens to be essential, due to its involvement in a separate essential pathway, more sophisticated molecular tools rather than direct deletion can be performed, similar to those that contributed to the identification of the first glycosyl transferase in M. voltae, where cross species complementation was performed. The first glycosyl transferase in M. maripaludis will also need to be validated since the three remaining candidates appear to be essential. In vitro analysis demonstrating sugar substrate specificity and perhaps inter-species complementation will reveal the identity of this protein. Finally, genes that are involved with the biosynthesis of the Nlinked sugars can be investigated fairly easily using MS with the newly identified N-linked glycan structure. Given the novel diglycoside of aldulose seen in M. maripaludis, archaea likely possess more unique sugars and any insight into the synthesis of these sugars will deepen our growing knowledge in Archaea, as well as to provide an increased repertoire of enzymes for possible glycoengineering studies.\n\nChapter 5\n\nThis study has provided data for the identification of two genes involved in the assembly and biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan attached to Methanoccocus maripaludis flagellins. The glycosyl transferase responsible for attaching the fourth sugar to the glycan was found along with a biosynthetic protein responsible for modifying the third sugar in the glycan with the addition of an acetamidino functional group. It was found that both deletion mutants of these proteins were missing the last sugar of the glycan and the threonine amino acid that is located at the C6 position of the third sugar, while the mutant of the biosynthetic gene was also lacking the acetamidino group. The study also limits the potential number of gene candidates that encode for the glycosyl transferase responsible for attaching the first sugar, to only four candidates. To summarize, the data presented in this work provides further insight into the N-linked glycosylation process as well as the biosynthesis and modification of these N-linked sugars in archaea."
