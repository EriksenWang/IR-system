    "abstract": "The Iberian Peninsula, at the western end of the Alpine-Himalayan Belt, displays a complex structure with mountain ranges of diverse structural trends and sedimentary basins between them. The Iberian Peninsula also shows an elevated mean topography, the highest in Europe. In this short paper, we investigate the Alpine evolution of the Iberian Peninsula since Mesozoic times, when Iberia was isolated as an independent plate. This occurred from Albian (formation of the northern plate boundary) to Oligocene times (end of the Pyrenean Orogeny). Iberia was squeezed between Africa and Europe during Tertiary times and all previously established Mesozoic extensional basins were inverted, as were some of the Hercynian structures. The opening of the Valencia Trough, cutting the eastern margin of the Iberian Peninsula, began in Oligocene times. Concomitant crustal and lithospheric stretching during the Neogene along the eastern margin of Iberia produced limited uplifts, some of which are still active. The modern topography of the Iberian Peninsula was developed mainly as the result of three main tectonothermal mechanisms since late Palaeozoic times: variations in crustal densities, and possibly mantle depletion, inherited from the Hercynian Orogeny; crustal and lithospheric thickening during Tertiary compression; and upper mantle thinning during the Neogene-Quaternary.",
    "full_text": "The Iberian Peninsula constitutes the westernmost segment of the 12 000 km long Alpine-Himalayan Belt formed as a result of the Tertiary closure of the Tethys Ocean during the collision of India, Arabia and Africa with Asia and Europe (e.g. Dercourt et al. 1986).\n\nRifting initiated during Triassic times (c. 250 Ma) and culminated in crustal break-up along the Atlantic margin (e.g. Ziegler, 1988Ziegler, , 1992)). Continental break-up of the African Plate occurred during the Late Jurassic (c. 156 Ma). The Atlantic Ocean propagated northwards through the proto-Azores -Gibraltar plate boundary, producing the continental rupture of the Iberian Plate in Early Cretaceous times (c. 118 Ma; e.g. Srivastava et al. 1990). The mid-Cretaceous northern boundary of the Iberian Plate formed along the oceanic lithosphere of the Atlantic Ocean and its eastern continuation along the continental lithosphere of the Pyrenees (Fig. 1).\n\nTowards the end of Late Cretaceous (chron 33, 80 Ma) Africa shifted its motion northwards, initiating convergence with Eurasia with the consumption of the Tethys Ocean (e.g. Dercourt et al. 1986). At the westernmost termination of the Alpine -Himalayan Belt, the Iberian Plate underwent a protracted deformation phase, resulting in orogenic belts along the plate boundaries (Bay of Biscay-Pyrenees and Azores -Gibraltar) and severe intraplate deformation. Several large Tertiary sedimentary basins developed on the Iberian Plate close to the bounding mountain chains (Friend & Dabrio 1996). Most of these basins began as flexural basins and continued as intermontane basins during the growth of the complex Iberian mountain system (Fig. 1).\n\nIberia initially moved together with the African Plate, from latest Cretaceous to mid-Eocene times (chron 19, 42 Ma), deforming mainly the Bay of Biscay-Pyrenees plate boundary. From mid-Eocene to the end of Oligocene times (chron 6c, 24 Ma), it moved independently and both plate boundaries were active. Subsequently, during the last 24 Ma, most of the deformation was accommodated along the complex and poorly understood plate boundary between Iberia and Africa, leading to the formation of the Betics, the Gibraltar Arc, and the Rif. The end of the Oligocene also coincided with extension along the proto-Western Mediterranean Sea, which affected the entire eastern margin of the Iberian Plate. This extension formed the oceanic lithosphere below the Liguro-Provenc ¸al Basin north of the Paul Fallot Fault. To the south of this fault, thinned lithosphere below the Valencia Trough and Alboran Sea and oceanic lithosphere below the Algeria Basin formed (Fig. 1). The present contact between Africa and Iberia changes progressively from pure rightlateral strike-slip along the Gloria Fault to a diffuse transpressive boundary from the Gorringe Bank to the Gulf of Cadiz region (e.g. Argus et al. 1989).\n\nThe present structure of the Iberian Peninsula developed through the interplay of several geodynamic processes related to the Atlantic opening, the formation of two plate boundaries limiting the Iberian Plate, the north-south Africa -Europe convergence, and the concomitant rapid retreat and consumption of the oceanic Tethyan realms. Different geodynamic processes related to these large-scale tectonic events were to some extent coeval over particular morphotectonic regions. Both the diversity of geodynamic processes and their potential conjunction complicate the unravelling of the evolution of the Iberian Plate in general and, in particular, the southern plate boundary between Iberia and Africa (Betic Cordillera, Rif, Alboran Sea and Gulf of Cadiz tectonic units).\n\nThis paper documents in brief the Alpine evolution of the onshore Iberian Peninsula mountain ranges and sedimentary basins, emphasizing the geodynamic processes that created positive topographic relief. This evolution took involved the following major tectonic events: (1) formation of extensional Mesozoic basins at the intersection of the proto-Atlantic and the Tethys oceans; (2) generation of Late Cretaceous-Tertiary fold-and-thrust belts and basins by the northwards motion of Africa; (3) formation of basins by Neogene extension along the eastern margin of the proto-Western Mediterranean. The paper concludes with the present topographic configuration of the Iberian Peninsula and its heritage from Hercynian times including the relatively recent lithospheric thinning along the Mediterranean province of Spain.\n\nTwo recently published books on the geology of Spain give a detailed description of the mountains and basins documented in this brief paper (Gibbons & Moreno 2002;Vera 2004). Andeweg (2002) has also illustrated the evolution of the palaeostress field in the Iberian Peninsula through the Cenozoic.\n\nPreceding the opening of the central Atlantic during mid-Jurassic times (chron BSMA at c. 170 Ma), the Iberian Peninsula (Iberian Plate) was deformed by large-scale stretching that resulted in numerous extensional basins with different orientations. Rift systems developed along the western margin of the Iberian Plate (offshore Galicia and Portugal; e.g. Malod & Mauffret 1990), within the continental plate (Iberian and Catalan rifts; e.g. Salas et al. 2001), and along the two plate boundaries (Pyrenean rift in the north and the rifted south Iberian margin; Fig. 2).\n\nThe opening of the central Atlantic produced an eastwards motion of Africa along the former Azores-Gibraltar transform fault. The Alpine -Tethys Ocean opened along the eastern margin of the Iberian Plate (e.g. Stampfli et al. 2002). This opening led to the cessation of rifting processes occurring within the Iberian Plate at the end of the Late Jurassic. A renewed phase of extension took place before the opening of the North Atlantic during the early Aptian (chron M0 at about 118 Ma). Pyrenean rift events occurred before the onset of ocean formation in the Bay of Biscay during Aptian -Albian times. The northern Iberian Plate transform boundary propagated eastwards and the northern segment of the Alpine-Tethys formed along the southeastern margin of Western Europe (Stampfli et al. 2002). These processes ended by the end of Coniacian at about 86 Ma.\n\nThe Iberian rift system formed a linked configuration of extensional basins with different orientations as observed in the NE corner of Spain at the eastern end of the east -west-trending Pyrenees, the NW -SE-trending Figueres -Montgrı ´branch (F-M in Fig. 2), and the NE-SW-directed Catalan Basin (Fig. 2).\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula at the end of Cretaceous times (Fig. 2), before the onset of Africa -Europe convergence, shows extended regions within the plate as well as along its margins. It is interesting to note that, during this period, at the end of Mesozoic extension, there are about 125-150 km of separation between the central and eastern sides of France and Spain, and at least 35 km of extension in the Iberian Basin (Salas & Casas 1993;Salas et al. 2001). The restoration of the Prebetic and Subbetic units shows that their former, common, southeastern boundary was at least 90 km to the SSE of its present position (restoration according to Garcı ´a-Herna ´ndez et al. 1980). If we add the Internal Betics to the reconstruction by unfolding them to a minimum of double their present width (shortening of 50%), the SE boundary of the Internal Betics restores to about 210 km to the SE of its present position. Adding a counter-clockwise rotation of about 258 to fit reasonably well with the palaeomagnetic rotations observed in the Betics (Platt et al. 2003) before the end of the late Tortonian (Krijgsman & Garce ´s 2004), then the SE border of the Internal Betics restores to about 300 km to the SE (Fig. 2). This restoration is approximately in agreement with the proposed restoration by Platt et al. (2003).\n\nThe separation between Europe and Africa for this period is about 240 km along this transect (e.g. Boccaletti et al. 1977;Olivet 1996; see position B for Africa in Fig. 2). The proposed position of Africa provides very little room for the restored Betic domain, thus creating a significant space problem, which has already been recognized (e.g. Andrieux et al. 1971;Mauffret et al. 1989;Frizon de Lamotte et al. 1991;Lonergan & White 1997;Spakman & Wortel 2000). Andrieux et al. (1971) proposed a model, still used with modifications by a number of workers, in which the Alboran Block was displaced towards the west by lateral extrusion during the north-south convergence of Africa and Iberia.\n\nCrustal and lithospheric thinning was the common process that formed the extensional basins. The thinned regions constituted weaker zones at the end of the Cretaceous just before the onset of Tertiary compression. Most of these extensional basins were tectonically inverted, preserving their original basin orientation. An extensive distribution of Triassic evaporites controls the geometry of the thrust system in both previous tectonic basins and structural highs, as in the case of the southern end of the Iberian Chain along the Altomira thrust system (the western boundary of the Iberian Range; Fig. 3).\n\nIn Late Cretaceous times, the northern motion of Africa against Europe significantly deformed the Iberian Plate along the previously extended Mesozoic basins. These basins, of diverse orientations and sizes, developed along both the plate boundaries and within the interior of the plate. Along the northern Iberian Plate margin, the Pyrenees represent a continental collisional orogeny with limited northwards subduction, whereas a more complex region deformed in the Southern Iberian Plate, including the Betics and Rif, the Alboran Sea, and the Gulf of Cadiz. The western Iberian margin along the Portuguese coast represents a slightly inverted margin, especially in its southern segment (e.g. Alves et al. 2003;Zitellini et al. 2004). During the roughly north-south Alpine convergence the interior of the Iberian Peninsula deformed while mostly preserving the original trends of the previously extended basins: NE -SW in the Catalan Coastal Ranges, NW-SE in the Iberian Range, NE-SW in the Central System, and north-south in the Altomira Range (Mun ˜oz Martı ´n & De Vicente 1998; Fig. 3). All these fold-and-thrust systems are connected and at the intersections of any two of them there is always a linking zone in which the two different trends coexist as well as intermediary trends. The linkages between all the compressive fold-and-thrust belts indicate the synchronicity, at least partially, of several of these deformational events (Fig. 3).\n\nThese connections between the different thrust systems that shape the present Iberian Peninsula have been described since the early 1980s in several transects crossing the Iberian Peninsula. The linkage of different thrust systems and the partial synchronicity of the deformation are agreed upon by most workers (e.g. Guimera `1984;Banks & Warburton 1991;Anado ´n & Roca 1996;Casas Sainz & Faccenna 2001). The remarkable repetition of NE -SW trending chains in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula was interpreted as being produced by lithospheric folding during the Neogene (Cloetingh et al. 2002), in contrast to crustal and lithospheric thickening.\n\nIn the following sections, we describe the principal compressive mountain systems of the Iberian Peninsula and their associated sedimentary basins starting in the Pyrenees (see regional transect of Roca et al. 2004) and ending in the Betics (see regional transect of Frizon de Lamotte et al. 2004). Between these, all the smaller mountain ranges developed in an interior tectonic setting, within the Iberian Plate. Casas Sainz & Faccenna (2001) have published an overview of these compressive mountain chains. .\n\nThe partial subduction to the north of the Iberian lithosphere underneath the Europe along the Iberia-Europe plate boundary shaped the large-scale Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt (Choukroune & Team, 1989;Roure et al. 1989;Mun ˜oz 1992;Beaumont et al. 2000). The Pyrenean orogen is asymmetrical and double-sided, with the most significant thrust system developed towards the south, on top of the subducted zone as in most orogenic belts (e.g. Capote et al. 2002;Verge ´s et al. 2002;Fig. 3).\n\nAlthough Africa compressed the entire Iberian Plate during its northwards shift, the Pyrenees recorded the initial stages of generalized compression around Santonian times (e.   (1996). Sardinia is shown in its restored position prior to Neogene opening of the Gulf of Lyons (Olivet 1996). The Balearic Islands are shown in their restored position prior to Neogene opening of the Valencia Trough (Verge ´s & Sa `bat, 1999). Position A of Africa corresponds to the present position and position B to the restored position (e.g. Boccaletti et al. 1977;Olivet 1996).\n\nThe South Pyrenean flexural foreland basin was underfilled and marine from 55 to 37 Ma and then became overfilled and continental, starting with the deposition of mid -late Eocene Cardona evaporites until the end of shortening during the Oligocene (Puigdefa `bregas & Souquet 1986;Puigdefa `bregas et al. 1992;Verge ´s et al. 1995Verge ´s et al. , 1998)). At mid-late Eocene times (c. 37 Ma), uplift of the western Pyrenees triggered the end of the foreland basin stage and originated an intermontane basin bounded by the Pyrenees, the Catalan Coastal Ranges and the Iberian Range (e.g. Burbank et al. 1992;Garcı ´a-Castellanos et al. 2003). A long period of lacustrine deposition that lasted through the Oligocene and most of the Miocene characterized this endorheic period (Riba et al. 1983). An internal fluvial network delivered sediments to the Ebro Basin, which was characterized by a large central lake (e.g. Anado ´n et al. 1979;Arenas & Pardo 1999). The end of deformation occurred during late Oligocene times (c. 24.7 Ma; Meigs et al. 1996) although major basement uplift, based on fission-track cooling ages, ended at about 30 Ma (Fitzgerald et al. 1999). The late Oligocene -early Miocene age of younger compression in the western Pyrenees was synchronous with extensional processes affecting the eastern Pyrenees related to the formation of the Western Mediterranean basins. During late Miocene times, the endorheic Ebro fluvial system opened towards the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. Coney et al. 1996;Garcı ´a-Castellanos et al. 2003).\n\nThe Catalan Coastal Ranges have a NE-SW trend (Alpine-Tethys Ocean trend) and display the effects of multiple tectonic events, including Eocene compression and Oligocene-Miocene extension, the latter related to the opening of the Valencia Trough (e.g. Anado ´n et al. 1985; Fig. 3). The Catalan Coastal Ranges represent the inversion of earlier extensional structures, with the inversion affecting both cover and basement units (e.g. Roca & Guimera `1992). This thick-skinned style of tectonics affected the entire crust (Sa `bat et al.\n\nThe Iberian Range, with a NW -SE trend (nearly orthogonal to the Catalan coastal system), shows a complex structure involving cover and basement units (Alvaro et al. 1979;Casas Sainz & Faccenna, 2001; Fig. 3). The thrust system along the chain shows double vergence corresponding to the inversion of previous Mesozoic extensional faults. The NW termination of the range plunges beneath the Duero Basin and continues at depth below the frontal thrust of the Cantabrian Mountains. The northern tectonic displacement of the Iberian Range in its northwestern terminus is about 30 km (Casas Sainz 1993;Guimera `et al. 1995). The Sierra de Altomira on the southwestern side of the Iberian Range flanks the Tajo Basin to the east (Fig. 3). This almost north-south-trending fold-and-thrust system is detached above Triassic evaporites (Mun ˜oz Martı ´n & De Vicente 1998).\n\nThe Central System, with a NE-SW structural trend, comprises an uplifted block, like a large pop-up structure (Vegas et al. 1990), with relatively high topography and associated with crustal thickening (Mezcua et al. 1996;Fig. 3). This block bounds two large sedimentary basins in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula: the Duero Basin to the NW and the Tajo Basin to the SE.

AP, As Pontes Basin, located in NW Spain; CR, Ciudad Rodrigo Basin, located in the SW side of the Duero Basin. A, Altomira fold system, forming the western margin of the Iberian Range.\n\nCentral System thrusts the Duero and Tajo basins to the NW and SE, respectively (e.g. Querol 1989;De Vicente et al. 1996).\n\nThe Duero Basin is filled by a maximum of 2.5 km of Oligocene and Miocene continental deposits, mostly from the Cantabrian Mountains (e.g. Alonso Gavila ´n et al. 2004). The age of the younger sediments in the basin is late Miocene at about 9.6 Ma (Krijgsman et al. 1996). The Ciudad Rodrigo Basin, at the SW termination of the Duero Basin, opened to the Atlantic at the Oligocene -Miocene boundary (Santisteban et al. 1996; its location is shown in Fig. 3). Subsequently, after 9.6 Ma, the Duero River captured the closed Duero Basin and opened it to the Atlantic basin. The Tajo Basin filled with 2 -3 km of continental deposits ranging in age from the latest Oligocene to the latest Miocene (e.g. Alonso Zarza et al. 2004).\n\nTowards the NW corner of the Iberian Peninsula, small transpressional basins (such as the As Pontes basin) were filled with alluvial to lacustrine deposits during late Oligocene and earliest Miocene times (e.g. Cabrera et al. 1996; Fig. 3). The western boundary of the Duero Basin also formed during this period, closing it.\n\nThe Betic Cordillera, trending generally ENE-WSW, corresponds to part of the former northern Africa -Iberia plate boundary, developed on top of Iberian crust and cropping out now in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula (Figs 1 and 3). Although some aspects of the evolution of the Betic Cordillera are well known, there is still no agreement about the mechanisms that created it (see discussion of models by Calvert et al. 2000).\n\nThe Betic Cordillera is divided into the Internal Betics, comprising metamorphic basement, the External Betics, consisting of cover rocks, and the Guadalquivir Foreland Basin (e.g. Azan ˜on et al. 2002). The Alboran Sea, with a complex tectonic history, formed as a result of Neogene extension. Neogene to Quaternary depositional sequences fill curved, elongated and deep basins (e.g. Comas et al. 1999).\n\nThe Internal Betics comprise a tectonic pile of three different tectonic units separated by thrusts (Nevado-Fila ´bride at the base, Alpuja ´rride in the middle, and Mala ´guide at the top). Each unit displays a different degree of Alpine metamorphism, decreasing from the bottom to the top. The Nevado-Fila ´bride unit was affected by HP-LT metamorphism indicating that the rocks were located at depths of 50-70 km (the metamorphic evolution of the Internal Betics has been described by Comas et al. (1992)). The metamorphic units crop out as large antiforms that exhibit east-west trends in contrast to the ENE-WSW regional direction of the External Betics. Towards the western end of the Internal Betics, relatively large massifs of peridotites have been incorporated into the Alpuja ´rride thrust system (e.g. Ronda Peridotites; Tubı ´a et al. 1997).\n\nThe External Betics constitute a system of thrust sheets carrying different Mesozoic SE Iberian passive margin palaeogeographical units towards the foreland. The Subbetic Zone is located to the SE and the Prebetic Zone to the NW (Garcı ´a-Herna ´ndez et al. 1980). The stratigraphy of the External Betic units includes Triassic to Miocene successions. The Prebetic Zone is mostly composed of shallow-water deposits whereas the Subbetic Zone units are deeper and pelagic. The Campo de Gibraltar Unit consists of terrigenous deposits forming an Oligocene and early Miocene accretionary prism developed above the Subbetic Zone towards the WSW (e.g. Crespo-Blanc & Campos, 2001;Bonardi et al. 2003) that was actively deformed until late Tortonian times (e.g. Gra `cia et al. 2003). The external part of the Prebetic Zone is composed mainly of Triassic evaporates, unconformably overlain by an incomplete and discontinuous succession of Mesozoic to Neogene deposits. The most external part of the Prebetic system forms an intricate system of tectonic thrust imbricates and chaotic units, which possibly correspond to an imbricate thrust system emplaced in a marine depocentre filled with numerous olistoliths and olistostromes (e.g. Azan ˜on et al. 2002).\n\nContacts between units in the External Betics are principally foreland-directed thrusts involving different cover palaeogeographical domains mostly detached above Triassic evaporites. The cover-basement contact is a major hinterland-directed thrust in the east and centre of the Betics (Banks & Warburton 1991), which changes to a foreland-directed one to the west, where it over-thrusts the Subbetic Unit as well as the Campo de Gibraltar Unit. This hinterland-directed thrust was a response to tectonic wedging produced by the antiformal stack of basement units flattening on top of the Triassic detachment level (Banks & Warburton 1991). As for the rest of the mountain ranges of the Iberian Peninsula, the Triassic evaporites constitute an excellent detachment level between basement and cover rocks.\n\nSeveral relatively small intermontane basins filled with Neogene deposits are located along the contact between the Internal Betics and the External Betics (e.g. Iribarren et al. 2003). The Neogene to Quaternary Guadalquivir Basin, to the NW and WSW of the External Betics, corresponds to a foreland basin in front of the Betics thrust system (e.g. Bera ´stegui et al. 1998;Garcı ´a-Castellanos et al. 2002). Hercynian rocks of the Iberian Massif constitute the NW boundary of the basin.\n\nBeginning in mid-Oligocene times the opening of the Valencia Trough created an extensional fault system paralleling most of the eastern coast of northeastern Spain (e.g. Roca et al. 2004;Fig. 3). This system cut obliquely across the Early Tertiary compressive Catalan Coastal Ranges and cut the SE termination of the Iberian Range almost perpendicularly, forming an extensional arrangement of basins parallel to the Mediterranean coast (e.g. Roca et al. 1999). Concomitant uplift of segments of the Catalan Coastal Ranges as well as of the SE margin of the Ebro Basin initiated the development of the present landscape configuration (e.g. Morgan & Ferna `ndez 1992;Lewis et al. 2000;Gaspar-Escribano et al. 2004). Fission-track studies indicate that more than 1.5 km of uplift occurred, responsible for the significant dissection of this margin (Juez-Larre ´& Andriessen 2002).\n\nTo the SE of the Iberian Plate, an early Miocene large-scale system of normal faults connected to the Alboran Sea extensional system cuts the rear flank of the Internal Betics antiform. Most of these large normal faults are subparallel to the Internal Betics antiformal thrusts, reactivating some of them (e.g. Platt & Vissers 1989;Garcı ´a-Duen ˜as et al. 1992;Crespo-Blanc et al. 1994;Comas et al. 1999). The Alboran Basin is filled by up to 8 km of early Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary sequences (e.g. Comas et al. 1999).\n\nThe present-day mean elevation of the Iberian Peninsula, slightly over 600 m, is almost certainly the highest in Western Europe. Smith (1996) pointed this out but did not propose a good solution for what is sustaining it. However, the integration of the tectonic structure of the Iberian Peninsula with its topography (Fig. 4), Bouguer anomalies (Fig. 5), and existing 2D and 3D lithospheric models can explain most of this high topography.\n\nThe greatest negative Bouguer anomalies of the Iberian Peninsula show a very good match with its principal Tertiary mountain chains such as the Pyrenees, the Iberian Range, the Central System and the Betics (e.g. Casas Sainz & Faccenna 2001;Cloetingh et al. 2002). Available geophysical modelling indicates that these negative anomalies, corresponding to compressive systems, are primarily explained by crustal thickening, which in most cases is combined with lithospheric thickening such as has been inferred for the Pyrenees (Zeyen & Ferna `ndez 1994) and the Central Betics (Torne et al. 2000). Cloetingh et al. (2002) proposed an alternative mechanism, lithospheric folding, as the main cause of alternating mountain ranges and basins of the central part of Iberia, but combined crustal and lithospheric modelling, as for the Pyrenees by Zeyen & Ferna `ndez (1994), does not support this interpretation.\n\nTo the west and SW of the Iberian Range there is a very large segment of the Iberian Peninsula with an elevated topography between 600 and 1000 m (Fig. 4). This region corresponds to the Central Iberian Zone of the Variscan Iberian Massif and includes the Tajo and Duero basins, and also shows a significant negative Bouguer anomaly (Fig. 5), suggesting that the crust of this region is either thickened or less dense than the surrounding crust, or a combination of both (Ferna `ndez et al. 1998). The former interpretation can be applied to the NE domain (Duero and Tajo basins) where thick Tertiary sedimentary successions are present. However, to account for the regional distribution of the negative Bouguer anomaly and elevated topography the hypothesis of a less dense crust for the whole of the Central Iberian Zone is more realistic.\n\nFinally, in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, the Ossa Morena and South Portuguese zones are dominated by a Bouguer anomaly maximum (Fig. 5), coinciding with an average topographic height of about 200 m. Field studies demonstrate an increase in crustal density for these two Hercynian domains. A 2D lithospheric model, which integrates elevation, gravity, geoid and heat-flow data, indicates that the present lithospheric structure in these two domains, with relatively high crustal density, must be underlain by a thinned lithosphere or by a depleted lithospheric mantle (Ferna `ndez et al. 2004). According to the model, the mass deficit WebColor related to mantle thinning or depletion implies a lithospheric buoyancy-driven uplift of about 120-150 m to fit the observed elevation and geoid data (Ferna `ndez et al. 2004).\n\nOn the Mediterranean margin of Iberia, crustal and lithospheric mantle thinning show dissimilar patterns. Thin lithospheric mantle underlies onshore Iberia at three main localities (marked by the 70 km thick lithosphere contour; Fig. 6): in NE Spain, on the southern flank of the Valencia Trough, and in SE Spain. Positive Bouguer anomalies, crustal and lithospheric thinning, high topography, and asthenospheric volcanism characterize these three regions.\n\nIn NE Iberia, several studies show that thinning was more intense in the lithospheric mantle than in the crust, producing additional uplift as well as basic volcanism (e.g. Cabal & Ferna `ndez 1995;Lewis et al. 2000;Ayala et al. 2003;Fig. 7). Radiometric ages for volcanic rocks of the NE volcanic province indicate that there was a migration of volcanism to the SW and west from 14 to 0.011 Ma (e.g. Saula et al. 1994;Lewis et al. 2000;Martı ´2004). This indicates that lithospheric thinning and concomitant uplift started during late mid-Miocene times and is still active at present. At the southern end of the Valencia Trough, the SE volcanic province, in Levante (Fig. 6), shows ages ranging from 8 to 1 Ma (Ancochea & Huertas 2004). Towards the SE of Iberia, 3D crustal and lithospheric modelling shows that this area is also supported dynamically (Torne et al. 2000). The SE volcanic province in Almerı ´a and Murcia shows only a few alkaline volcanic edifices (Lo ´pez-Ruiz et al. 2004; Fig. 6).\n\nThe lithospheric geometry and the existence of onshore alkaline volcanic provinces along the coast as well as in the interior of Iberia (Campo de Calatrava volcanic province; Fig. 6) has been interpreted as being indicative of a long-lived deep process related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean (Oyarzun et al. 1997). According to Oyarzun et al. (1997), the thinning along the Western Mediterranean region corresponds to a long, sublithospheric channelling starting in the Cape Verde and ending in the northern North Sea (Ziegler 1990).\n\nThus, the present-day topography of the Iberian Peninsula was mostly acquired by means of three main tectonothermal mechanisms effective since the Late Paleozoic: variations of crustal densities and possibly mantle depletion inherited from the Hercynian Orogeny, crustal and lithospheric thickening during Tertiary compression, and upper mantle thinning during the Neogene-Quaternary. However, the present landscape of the Iberian Peninsula has also been sculpted by the opening of numerous endorheic basins. The most spectacular of these openings occurred in the Ebro Basin during the early late Miocene (Coney et al. 1996;Lewis et al. 2000;Garcı ´a-Castellanos et al. 2003). The best preserved basin is the Duero Basin, in which river incision is still relatively minor.\n\nBetween a widespread Triassic phase of extension and the opening of the central Atlantic in Late Jurassic times, Iberia was affected by extensional processes that created numerous sedimentary basins with different orientations, including the Pyrenees, Catalan and Iberian basins, and the Betic basin on the southern margin of Iberia. The Alpine -Tethys Ocean opened at this time, forming the eastern margin of the Iberian Plate.\n\nAn additional extensional phase, forming the western margin of Iberia, took place before the opening of the North Atlantic during the early Aptian. This transform boundary propagated eastwards from the Bay of Biscay and constituted the northern plate boundary of the Iberian Plate, resulting in its isolation. These processes ended by the end of the Coniacian.\n\nBasins formed during these extensional phases were inverted during Late Cretaceous-Tertiary compression, which started in Santonian times. The extent and orientation of the basins controlled the size, width and trends of the compressive belts, which normally show a double vergence. In almost all the Iberian fold-and-thrust belts, Triassic evaporites provided an excellent decoupling level between the basement and the cover units. The Iberian mountain chains produced lithospheric flexural bending and thus foreland basins, especially in front of the Pyrenees and the Betics: the Ebro and Aquitaine basins flank the Pyrenees and the Guadalquivir Basin lies to the north of the Betics. The Duero and Tajo basins developed to the south of the Cantabrian Mountains and to the south of the Central System, respectively. The Ebro, Duero and Tajo basins became intermontane basins at different stages of their evolution by the closure of their Atlantic connections. The basins were filled by radial fluvial systems feeding central lakes. Starting in the late Oligocene, the opening of the Valencia Trough initiated the development of a system of normal faults and linked basins aligned with the present Mediterranean coastline of Iberia.\n\nThe deformation history of the Iberian Peninsula produced a significant mean elevation that is the highest in Europe. Tertiary compressional processes contributed strongly to an increase of mean elevation, but inherited Hercynian lithospheric structures as well as late Cenozoic upper mantle thinning related to the opening of the Western Mediterranean also contributed to the high average elevation of the Iberian Peninsula. Some of the thermo-mechanical processes affecting the eastern margin of the Iberian Peninsula are still active at present.   Lewis et al. 2000). The SW area is limited to the footwall of the Oligoceneearly Miocene normal faults that parallel the coastline. The NE area is wider and affects part of the previous area and both the footwall and hanging wall of the late Miocene-Quaternary NW-SE-trening system of normal faults. The volcanism migrated westwards from the Emporda Basin to the la Selva Basin and finally to La Garrotxa, where it is as young as 0.011 Ma.\n\nFrom: GEE, D. G. & STEPHENSON, R. A. (eds) 2006.
