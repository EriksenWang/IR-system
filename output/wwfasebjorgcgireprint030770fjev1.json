    "abstract": "Protein deposition diseases involve the aggregation of normally soluble proteins, leading to both fibrillar and amorphous deposits. The aggregation of α-synuclein is associated with Parkinson's disease, and the aggregation of the Aβ peptide is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that L-dopa, dopamine, and other catecholamines dissolve fibrils of α-synuclein and Aβ peptide generated in vitro. The catecholamines also inhibited the fibrillation of these proteins. In addition, intraneuronal α-synuclein deposits formed in a mouse model were dissolved by incubation of tissue slices with L-dopa. These catecholamines are susceptible to oxidative breakdown, and we show that oxidation products are more effective than the parent compounds in inhibition. The ability to dissolve fibrils provides a new approach for studying mechanisms and consequences (e.g., the relationship between fibril formation and neurodegeneration) of protein aggregation. It is also likely to help in the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of protein deposition diseases.",
    "full_text": "is normally enzymatically decarboxylated to yield 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), which is converted into 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid, HVA). Epinephrine and norepinephrine are structurally related catecholamines, which are also found in the brain.\n\nThe identification of molecules that inhibit protein deposition or reverse fibril formation may be a critical step toward a better understanding of the pathophysiology of inclusions and deposits in human diseases. It may allow us to evaluate the role of fibrils in neurodegenerative processes and disease progression, and, should these molecules exert neuroprotective effects, their discovery could open new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Numerous compounds have been shown to inhibit specific amyloid fibril formation in vitro (12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20). Two of these agents have also been reported to reverse Aβ amyloid aggregation (17,21). As for α-synuclein, catecholamines (22) and β-synuclein (23,24) been found to inhibit its fibrillation. However, no compounds have yet been described that will disassemble fibrils of α-synuclein.\n\nGiven the localization of α-synuclein aggregation to dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, the present investigation was initially undertaken to determine the role of L-dopa, dopamine, and its metabolites on the fibrillation of α-synuclein. Our results demonstrated that, not only did the catecholamines inhibit α-synuclein fibrillation, but they also caused disaggregation of existing fibrils. Similar effects with Aβ suggest the potential generality of this finding.\n\nRecombinant human α-synuclein was produced and purified by using the IMPACT system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (25) or expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cell line transfected with pRK172/α-synuclein WT plasmid (kind gift of M. Goedert, MRC Cambridge) and purified as previously described (26) with some modifications. The purity of the resultant protein was assessed by PAGE, gel-filtration, and electrospray mass spectrometry. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 275 nm and using an extinction coefficient of E 1mg/ml = 0.40. Thioflavin T, dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), L-dopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), nor-and epinephrine, and adrenochrome were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were of analytical grade from Fisher Chemicals. Dopaminochrome was prepared by oxidation of dopamine (1 mM) with potassium iodate (1 mM) in 100 mM aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) (27,28). The reactions were conducted at 23°C with shaking for 1 min, 20 min, and 1 h (the 1 h product was used in the αsynuclein fibrillation experiments). The products were analyzed with reversed-phase HPLC: Only one peak was observed in the chromatogram.\n\nSolutions of 1 mg/ml α-synuclein or Aβ at pH 7.5 in 25 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl buffer were stirred or shaken at 37°C. Fibril formation was monitored with Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence as previously described (25).\n\nα-Synuclein or Aβ fibrils, preformed in 2 ml glass vials, were incubated with catechols at various concentrations with stirring in glass vials at 37°C. The fibril dissociation was monitored by ThT fluorescence, light-scattering, TEM, and AFM.\n\nα-Synuclein and Aβ aggregation and fibril dissolution were monitored by static light-scattering using either a Labsystems Nepheloskan or Fluoromax-2 instrument, with similar experimental conditions to those for ThT monitoring.\n\nAn aliquot of 5 µl of sample was loaded on a Formvar-coated, carbon-stabilized copper grid (300 mesh from Ted Pella Inc., Redding CA). After 1 min, the excess solution was drained off using a Whatman filter paper. The grid was briefly washed and negatively stained with 5 µl of 1% uranyl acetate. The grid was air-dried and then viewed on a JEOL JEM-100B transmission electron microscope operating with an accelerator voltage of 80 kV. Typical magnifications ranged from 20,000 to 50,000×.\n\nSamples of 1 mg/ml fibrils were diluted 1:5 with water and were added to freshly cleaved mica (about 1 × 1 cm). Samples were taken in air and in fluid at a scan frequency of 1-2 Hz. AFM images were collected with an Autoprobe CP multiple SPM (Park Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) in tapping mode. The tube scanner was a 100 µm Scanmaster (Park Scientific). Image processing and determination of the fraction of the surface covered by fibrils were performed by using the SPIP program (Image Metrology, Denmark).\n\nAliquots were removed from the α-synuclein incubation at various times, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm. Sample volumes of 18 µl supernatant were eluted from a TSK-GEL G2000SW XL size-exclusion column (7.8 mm ID × 30 cm) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mM Na 2 SO 4 by using Waters 2695 separations module with a Waters 996 Photodiode Array (PDA) detector. The HPLC system was controlled, and data were collected and analyzed by Millenium software. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the mobile phase was monitored over the wavelength range from 220 to 450 nm with bandwidth of 1.2 nm.\n\nAfter dialysis against water, samples were analyzed by electrospray MS (Micromass Quattro II) in 50% acetonitrile, pH 2.\n\nMidbrain blocks from control and paraquat-treated brains were prepared and stained with thioflavine S and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as described previously (29). Thioflavine S staining and TH immunoreactivity were examined by using Leica NT confocal microscopy.\n\nThe kinetics of in vitro Aβ and α-synuclein fibril formation show the classic sigmoidal behavior of aggregating systems, usually attributed to a nucleation-dependent polymerization (30). In addition, substantial evidence indicates the presence of intermediates in fibrillation, including oligomeric ones (31,32). In fact, it has been suggested that oligomeric intermediates in aggregation (\"protofibrils\") may well be the critical toxic species (33)(34)(35)(36). We monitored fibril formation by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), light-scattering and a ThT fluorescence assay (37). In order to minimize potential interactions between the dye and the catecholamines, the ThT fluorescence was measured immediately on addition of an aliquot of the incubation sample to the dye. Using both ThT fluorescence and light-scattering, we confirmed the report that various catecholamines, including L-dopa and dopamine in micromolar concentrations, inhibit fibril formation of α-synuclein (22). We report for the first time that these catecholamines (typically in the 10-100 µM range) also inhibit the formation of Aβ fibrils from monomeric Aβ(1-40) peptide when monitored by ThT (Fig. 1). The amount of inhibition was dependent on the concentration of dopamine or L-dopa. Electron and AFM microscopy images confirmed the lack of fibrils when the proteins were incubated in the presence of dopamine (>10 µM) or L-dopa (>50 µM); a few fibrils are observed, but dramatically fewer than in the control. Size-exclusion HPLC was used to determine the association state of α-synuclein during fibrillation inhibition by dopamine and L-dopa: Both monomer and multiple oligomers were observed; with L-dopa inhibition the major product was the oligomer, Fig. 2. Spectral scans of the HPLC peaks showed that the α-synuclein in the oligomers had been modified by reaction with a dopamine oxidation product, leading to a covalently modified α-synuclein with a new absorbance maximum at ~320 nm (Fig. 2, inset) and fluorescence emission λ max around 450 nm (for excitation at 350 nm). Circular dichroism and FTIR experiments showed that the changes in conformation of soluble αsynuclein normally observed during fibrillation (increased β-structure) were absent in the presence of the catecholamines (Fig. 3). We also compared the effects of the catecholamines on the familial Parkinson's disease α-synuclein mutants A53T and A30P with those on wild-type αsynuclein: The A53T variant was inhibited to a greater extent at lower dopamine concentrations (≤ µM), whereas there was little difference between the inhibition of the A30P and wild-type.\n\nThe catecholamines are very susceptible to oxidation leading to the formation of aminochromes, Fig. 4 (38). We measured the kinetics of the stability of dopamine and L-dopa under the αsynuclein incubation conditions (also at pH 2 and 5) by changes in their absorbance spectra: The spectra for 20 µM catecholamine showed no changes at pH 2 and 5 but showed evidence of oxidative decomposition and polymerization at pH 7. The half-life for decomposition depended on the catecholamine concentration but was in the range of 5-10 h under the conditions used to generate fibrils.\n\nIn order to separate the effects of the catecholamines themselves from those of their oxidative breakdown products, we compared the inhibitory effects on α-synuclein fibrillation of fresh and aged (pre-incubated) solutions, as well as anaerobic conditions. The results demonstrated that aged (12 or 24 h) dopamine was a significantly more effective inhibitor than \"fresh\" dopamine, which was confirmed by experiments under anaerobic conditions in which the inhibition was significantly attenuated. These observations indicate that it is an oxidative product (or products) of dopamine and L-dopa that is/are the most active inhibitory form(s) in fibril formation of αsynuclein and explains why the inhibition of dopamine was observed at pH ≥5 only: Dopamine is much more stable at lower pH. Co-incubation of anti-oxidants such as ascorbic acid or soluble forms of vitamin E had no effect on the dopamine or L-dopa inhibition of fibrillation (ascorbic acid itself, but not vitamin E or glutathione, caused weak inhibition of fibrillation).\n\nThe major oxidative pathway of L-dopa is shown in Fig. 4, which is typical for catecholamine oxidation. The two most stable intermediates are the quinone and the aminochrome, although even these are relatively unstable. Thus, the most likely species responsible for the inhibition of fibrillation by catecholamines are the quinones and aminochromes (see below).\n\nThe oxidative breakdown of catecholamines, at high concentrations or long time periods, can lead to cross-linking of polypeptides, due to generation of hydroxyl radicals. In order to determine the potential role of such oxidation during the incubation of α-synuclein, covalent cross-linking was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and mass spectra were obtained at the completion of the experiments. These experiments demonstrated that cross-linking of soluble protein occurred under some conditions with increasing time periods during the incubation with dopamine, especially at higher dopamine concentrations (mM). However, at the lower concentrations of catecholamine and shorter time periods used in the experiments reported here, inhibition and disaggregation occurred in the absence of detectable cross-linking, based on SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (Fig. 5).\n\nDopaminochrome, a relatively stable product of dopamine oxidation, was found to be a potent inhibitor, with 20 µM completely abolishing α-synuclein fibrillation (Fig. 6). We also compared the inhibitory properties of epinephrine (see below) and its oxidation product, adrenochrome (Fig. 6). Adenochrome and aged epinephrine caused similar increases in the lagtime compared with fresh epinephrine, but the aged sample had a larger effect in decreasing the rate of elongation, indicating that other oxidation products (probably the quinone) were also inhibitory.\n\nWe assessed the essential molecular structural requirements for efficiency in preventing or reversing αsynuclein fibril formation by comparing the effects of numerous structurally related compounds [including 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (HVA), epinephrine, norepinephrine and tyrosine]. Whereas HVA and Tyr had no effect, DOPAC, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were qualitatively similar to L-dopa and dopamine, in that their presence in micromolar concentration prevented formation of fibrils and also dissolved pre-existing fibrils (see below). The concentration of compound necessary for half-maximal effect were in the order dopamine < L-dopa < DOPAC.\n\nWe performed a variety of experiments in order to determine whether dopamine and L-dopa could dissolve existing fibrils of α-synuclein and Aβ. The addition of dopamine or L-dopa at the completion of the fibrillation reaction, as monitored by ThT, led to a rapid, concentrationdependent, exponential decrease in fluorescence signal that was consistent with loss of fibrils. Whereas in controls with no additions, the ThT signal remained essentially constant (Fig. 7a, b). Confirmation that the ThT was indeed monitoring loss of fibrils was obtained from lightscattering experiments (Fig. 7c) and AFM (Fig. 7d), as well as SDS-PAGE on the soluble and insoluble fractions (data not shown). Because the results were very similar for both α-synuclein and Aβ, and for L-dopa and dopamine, only representative data are shown.\n\nWe used EM and AFM to directly demonstrate that dopamine and L-dopa caused fibrils to disassemble. Electron micrographs show that, in contrast to the control (fibrils incubated with buffer), the presence of dopamine or L-dopa caused fibrils of both α-synuclein and Aβ to disappear with increasing time of incubation. Thus, whereas essentially all the fibrils are still present after 24 h in control incubations, they are virtually absent at 4 h in the presence of 150 µM dopamine or L-dopa (Fig. 8a-d). Similarly, AFM showed an analogous progressive loss of fibrils with increasing time of incubation with dopamine (Fig. 8e-g). In this case, it is clear that associated material (amorphous or oligomers) is still present, but is no longer fibrillar. For αsynuclein, size-exclusion HPLC again indicated that the predominant end-product was a soluble oligomer.\n\nWe monitored the dopamine-induced dissolution of a single α-synuclein fibril immobilized on mica in aqueous solution (Fig. 9). After 30 min, the fibril still looked relatively unchanged. By 1 h, however, the fibril had significantly disintegrated, and no fibrillar material was observed at 2 and 4 h. This was a particularly dramatic illustration of the disaggregating power of these compounds on fibrils, and indicated that the fibril began to dissolve from both the center and the ends. In the absence of dopamine the fibrils were stable.\n\nWe obtained additional confirmation that dopamine was disaggregating fibrils by incubating fibrils (of either Aβ or α-synuclein) in the presence of 100 µM dopamine and removing aliquots as a function of time. These were then centrifuged, and the pellet and supernatants fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to protein in the pellet decreased with time at a rate similar to that observed by decrease in ThT fluorescence, which confirmed the loss of fibrils.\n\nLight-scattering was used to confirm the dopamine-induced dissolution of α-synuclein fibrils. The scattering for the control was essentially unchanged over time, whereas the presence of dopamine caused a substantial decrease in scattering, with a rate similar to that observed for the decrease in ThT fluorescence for comparable conditions (Fig. 7c). The decrease in lightscattering indicated a decrease in either the size of the scattering particles and/or a decrease in their number. Both were consistent with the conversion of fibrils into smaller, soluble oligomeric species.\n\nWe finally addressed the question of whether L-dopa would disaggregate α-synuclein deposits in biological samples. In a recent study, we have shown that formation of α-synuclein-containing aggregates can be induced in an animal model in which mice are exposed to the herbicide paraquat (29). In order to test the ability of L-dopa to reverse α-synuclein deposition in biological tissues, we treated mice with 3 weekly injections of 10 mg/kg paraquat (a regimen that consistently results in aggregate formation; 29), prepared coronal sections of their midbrain, and incubated tissues in buffer solution with or without L-dopa. Subsequent staining with thioflavine S, a dye known to bind to amyloid fibrils (39)(40)(41), was used to visualize intraneuronal deposits. Staining was minimal in control animals injected with saline (data not shown). However, following paraquat exposure, thioflavine S-positive aggregates became evident within neurons in the substantia nigra, with a number of cells showing intense staining in both the cytosolic and nuclear regions (Fig. 10a). Previous work has demonstrated that these aggregates contain αsynuclein and are present within tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (i.e., dopaminergic) neurons (29). Quite remarkably, a substantial reduction in thioflavine S staining was observed in tissue sections pre-treated with L-dopa (Fig. 10b). The number of thioflavine-positive neurons was decreased and, within positive cells, the staining was significantly less intense. This effect could not be attributed to sample treatment and processing. Tissues in Fig. 10a, b were processed in parallel and subjected to the same washing procedures after incubation in the absence or presence of L-dopa. Furthermore, this incubation was unlikely to affect tissue integrity or to alter subsequent neuronal staining, as indicated by the similar pattern and intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in neurons treated with or without L-dopa (Fig. 10c, d).\n\nThe aggregation of Aβ and α-synuclein are established as key factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and related α-synucleinopathies (4). Consequently, molecules that inhibit aggregation of these polypeptides may lead to therapies to prevent or control the corresponding diseases. Several recent observations suggest that oligomeric intermediates (sometimes called protofibrils) present during aggregation may be more cytotoxic than fibrils themselves (42,43).\n\nOur data indicate that the presence of micromolar concentrations of dopamine or L-dopa is sufficient to significantly inhibit fibril formation or disaggregate existing fibrils of Aβ or αsynuclein in vitro. Because estimates of dopamine concentration in striatal nerve terminals and Ldopa concentrations in the striatum after administration are >>50 and 50 µM, respectively (11), the concentrations used in our experiments are physiologically relevant. This was further confirmed in the experiments using paraquat-treated mice, which showed that treatment of the αsynuclein deposits for 20 min with 250 µM L-dopa dramatically decreased the amount of deposit. Because these deposits were Thioflavine S-positive, it is reasonable to assume that they were fibrillar.\n\nWhereas it is clear from our results that catechol derivatives not only inhibit fibril formation but also dissolve existing fibrils, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects remain to be ascertained and may be different. As a potential mechanism of fibril inhibition, Conway et al. (22) have proposed that the orthoquinone derivative of dopamine may form a covalent adduct with 5-10% of the α-synuclein. The small amounts of covalently modified α-synuclein would then inhibit fibrillation, leading to the accumulation of protofibrils. Our results are consistent with such a mechanism.\n\nOur data indicate that the major active species in the inhibition of fibrillation by catecholamines is probably a product (or products) of oxidative breakdown and that the inhibition most likely arises from accumulation of a stable oligomer. Catecholamine quinones are expected to be susceptible to nucleophilic attack via Michael addition or imine (Schiff-base) formation, and these are the likely to be the main reactions leading to covalent modification of α-synuclein (via Lys side-chains) under our experimental conditions. Because inhibition/disaggregation is observed with aged samples of the catecholamines, as well as the aminochromes, it is clear that inhibition/disaggregation does not require the presence of the ROS generated during the oxidative breakdown of the catecholamines. Although the MS results do not show evidence for dityrosine formation (e.g., dimers) or covalent modification by dopamine quinone, small levels of such modification would not be detectable; it is also possible that the modifications (e.g., Schiff base) are reversed in the MS analysis. The new fluorescence emission of α-synuclein incubated with dopamine is most consistent with covalent modification, as suggested by Conway et al. (22) in their study of α-synuclein with catecholamines. Thus, it is quite possible that the catecholamine quinones form a Schiff base with one or more lysine residues in the protein, which are responsible for stabilizing the soluble oligomers and are readily lost under the acidic conditions of the mass spectrometry.\n\nDissolution of fibrils could involve preferential noncovalent interactions of the catechol with either soluble oligomers in equilibrium with fibrils, or with the fibrils themselves, leading to formation of stable, soluble oligomers. Alternately, covalent modification by reactive oxidation products could lead to weakening of the intermolecular forces in the fibrils resulting in disaggregation and formation of soluble monomers or oligomers. The presence of the monomeric form of α-synuclein in the SEC HPLC analysis of the end-products of inhibition and disaggregation could result from dissociation of the oligomer during the chromatography, or may reflect covalently modified monomer that does not associate.\n\nAlthough the catecholamines themselves are clearly unsuitable molecules for a therapeutic regime, it is possible that there are related derivatives that may be appropriate. There are several reports suggesting that dopamine agonists or MOA inhibitors, both of which can lead to increased levels of DA, may confer neuroprotection. This could result from DA inhibition of αsynuclein fibrillation [although there are also several other possible explanations (44)(45)(46)(47)]. This suggests that elevated levels of dopamine can delay the progress of the disease, consistent with DA inhibition of α-synuclein fibrillation (and inconsistent with DA oxidation causing cell death).\n\nOur findings have important implications for understanding protein deposition diseases support the hypothesis that common molecular mechanisms may underlie the development of pathological features of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and suggest that common strategies of intervention could benefit patients suffering from these diseases. If fibrillar proteins contribute to neurodegeneration, then disassembly of fibrils by catechols may reverse or slow down disease progression. However, if intermediates of fibrillation and/or products of fibril disaggregation are neurotoxic, then the accumulation of stable fibrillar deposits, such as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, could be a marker of neurons that are relatively resistant to the neurodegenerative process.
