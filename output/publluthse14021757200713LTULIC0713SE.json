These contacts involve convergent gaps that are used to separate the surfaces in relative motion and generate pressure in the lubricant film. The contacts have to carry a load while keeping friction as low as possible. Environmental and economic concerns require the machines to operate with minimal power loss. A number of design modifications have been proposed over the years in order to decrease bearing power consumption. There are indications that surface topography can have a significant and positive influence on hydrodynamic performance. Texturing of a load carrying surface is a process that would be beneficial in lubricated conformal contacts as it would be possible to obtain thicker films and reduced frictional losses.\n\nTextured lubricated contacts are analysed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code through different geometries. The effects of the texture on hydrodynamic performance of the contact are investigated. For the simulations performed, the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved under steady-state conditions. The flow is taken to be laminar and two-dimensional. A journal bearing with several dimples created on the stationary part is firstly investigated. A realistic multiphase flow cavitation model is introduced and successfully validated. It is shown that the coefficient of friction can be reduced if dimples of suitable depth are introduced. This can be achieved either in the region of maximum hydrodynamic pressure for a bearing with high eccentricity ratio or just downstream of the maximum film for a bearing with low eccentricity ratio. A new effect of pressure build-up, generated by the surface texture, has been identified at low eccentricity ratios.\n\nThis pressure build-up effect is more extensively investigated through the study of an inclined slider bearing with a texture located at the inlet part of the contact, i.e. just downstream of the maximum film. The governing mechanism at the origin of an optimum in load carrying capacity for a smooth slider bearing is analysed and the effects of the texture on the pressure build-up and load carrying capacity are explained. The energy received by the fluid from the moving wall is converted into pressure in the first part of the converging contact and into losses in the second part. Convergence ratio can be increased until the limit where flow recirculation begins to occur is reached in order to get the greatest pressure gradient. The texture appears to reach its maximum efficiency when its depth is such that the velocity profile is stretched at its maximum without incoming recirculating flow. Thus, the wall profile shape controlling the velocity profile can be optimized for many hydrodynamic contacts. For such contacts, heat is usually produced due to shearing of the flow and the lubricant is subjected to temperature variations. Since the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant is\n\nIn machines used in everyday life, a lot of component parts are in relative motion with respect to each other. These parts can be in contact, sliding and rubbing over one another. Complex tribological behaviors and interactions then occurs at the interface between the surfaces.\n\nTribology is defined as the science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative motion. The word is derived from the Greek word \"tribo\" which means \"rubbing\". Tribology incorporates the study of friction, lubrication and wear.\n\nDuring the relative motion of two bodies, friction, which is the resistant force occuring, is an essential factor in tribology. In some components such as car brakes or clutches, high and predictable friction is of importance. Friction is even necessary when it comes to some everyday life movements such as walking or driving a car. But friction should be kept as low as possible in most cases such as bearings, gears, cams, piston rings... When two surfaces in a machine component come into contact during the operating cycle, friction needs to be minimized in order to save energy. The component contacts can be either lubricated or unlubricated, but they should be protected against wear.\n\nWear can be defined as a process in which the interaction of surfaces results in some removal of some material from one or both of the surfaces. Friction and wear can be controlled by lubrication. Since such a type of contact is generally loaded, one should avoid contact between the surfaces as it can lead to wear or failure of the system in the worst case. Therefore the contact should be able to sustain the imposed load. Different types of lubrication regimes exists depending on the operating conditions. The lubrication regimes are usually divided into three groups: boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication and hydrodynamic lubrication, Figure 1.1.\n\n• Boundary lubrication: Surfaces are in contact, the load is carried by the surface asperities.\n\n• Mixed lubrication: The load is carried by both the lubricant film and the asperities in contact.\n\n• Hydrodynamic lubrication: The surfaces are not in contact and a full film of lubricant, usually thicker than 1 μm, is carrying the load. Conformal contacts operates in this regime. This regime also includes the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime, where external load and pressure developed in the film are high enough to consider the elastic deformation of the surfaces. The contacts are non-conformal in this case.\n\nThe present work deals with hydrodynamic lubrication without any elastic deformation of the surface. Journal and thrust bearings, thrust washers and seals are known to operate in this regime. 1.1 Scope of the study\n\nIn hydrodynamic systems such as a journal or thrust bearing, a friction force is caused by a viscous resistance of the lubricant shearing. Due to economic concerns, the majority of research topics are devoted to friction reduction in this type of contact.\n\nReducing friction in a contact is achieved by reducing the mechanical losses. An increase in friction means that more force or torque is required to translate or rotate an element and thus more power is consumed leading to the emission of larger quantities of greenhouse effect gas. Environmental concerns are therefore also important. Thus for such hydrodynamic systems, the friction always needs to be minimized. A few alternatives can be realized to decrease friction, such as:\n\n• Reducing the lubricant viscosity • Operate the system at lower loads or shear rates\n\n• Modifying the geometry of the contact -By introducing singularities such as a step -By introducing a textured surface in the contact An increase of the load carrying capacity of the system is also a goal since it will enable the system to operate under higher loads without changing its lubricant film thickness.\n\nIt should be mentioned that for safety concerns, the system should operate above a minimum lubricant film thickness. The lubricant should form a film thick enough in order to be far from the failure zone. This should be kept in mind when optimisation is performed to decrease the friction or increase the load carrying capacity of the system.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the introduction of textured surfaces to improve performance of hydrodynamic contacts is the aim of the present study.\n\n• The main purpose of this study is to understand the effects and mechanisms of a textured surface in a hydrodynamic lubricated contact in order to be able to improve its lubrication in terms of load carrying capacity and friction.\n\n• Effect of texture geometry and its position in a lubricated contact should be analysed.\n\n• Influence of thermal conditions on lubrication of textured surfaces should be studied.\n\nTo achieve these goals, numerical simulations are performed with CFD.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIn lubricated contacts, some lubricant is trapped between two surfaces in relative motion. A thin lubricant film of the order of few micrometers exists in between the surfaces. The configuration of the surface is such that it often forms a variable gap in the lubricant film. The lubricant enters the gap and is subjected to a constriction. It then freely leaves the gap once the minimum gap has been passed by or can be subjected to an expansion through a diverging gap. Due to the change in film thickness, variation of the mechanical energy occurs and pressure is increased where the losses are reduced, see Paper C. Some pressure is then generated through the contact and the lubricant film can sustain a load as can be seen in Figure 2.1 for a journal bearing.\n\nFor this research study, a commercial CFD code [2] has been used for the numerical simulations of the lubricant flow in the textured contacts. The main advantage of using such CFD code is that an optimal design geometry can be tested and simulated before manufacturing a new machine component. Parameters of the geometry, computational domain as well as lubricant properties can be freely changed and tested. Another advantage lies in the relatively low time consumed compared with some experimental testing. This fact implies also much lower costs. Solutions obtained are likely to be grid dependent if care is not taken. Since the discretization of the domain in many computational cells induces an error on the numerical simulation, estimation of this error should be performed to get reliable results. Some methods, like Richardson's extrapolation, exist in order to quantify the grid error. This method is used and described more in the appended papers.\n\nA finite volume method is used to solve the governing equations describing the flow, given in steady-state below. The continuity equation (2.1) associated with the momentum equation (2.2) constitutes the Navier-Stokes equations. The continuity equation represents the conservation of mass flow. And the momentum equation is an equation of conservation of volume and surface forces.\n\nρ is the density of the fluid, x i represents the coordinate in the i-direction and u i represents the velocity in the i-direction.\n\np is the fluid pressure and μ the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe energy equation (2.3) relates the exchange between the internal energy and other forms of energy of the fluid.\n\nT is the fluid temperature, λ the thermal conductivity of the fluid and h tot is the specific total enthalpy.\n\nThe cavitation model used is the Rayleigh-Plesset model [2] which is a multiphase flow model. Lubricant vapour is produced by air bubbles when pressure falls under the saturation pressure p sat . The multiphase model is chosen to be homogeneous. In this case, the two fluids share the same velocity and pressure field. The global density and dynamic viscosity are given by the following:\n\nwhere r α is the volume fraction of phase α; N p is the number of flow phases (two in the present case). The sum of the volume fractions of the different phases has to be equal to unity such that:\n\nThe momentum equation (2.2) is unchanged but calculated with the density and the dynamic viscosity from equations (2.4) and (2.5). Equation (2.1) becomes a sum over all the phases and a mass transfer term between the phases is added:\n\nwhere Γ αβ is the interphase mass transfer from phase α to β derived in the same way as in reference [2].\n\nChapter 3\n\nA texture can be defined as a pattern which is repeating itself. A textured surface is then a surface which form is composed of such repeated patterns. In the present case of hydrodynamic lubrication, there are various shapes of pattern that are commonly used.\n\nThe main shapes are circular arcs, rectangles or triangles if seen in two-dimensions. Thus, a surface shape can result in sinusoidal corrugated form, sawtooth form, indented form... There exist different ways to manufacture such textures which are, usually, of the order of few micrometers deep. Commonly, microasperities can be created by photo-etching, laser texturing or by an ultra-violet photolithographic process as described in [3]. A textured pad bearing is illustrated in Figure 3.1.\n\nSuch textured surfaces have already been widely used. They have also been the subject of several theoretical and experimental studies. Most theoretical results reported so far are isothermal and some are obtained for a single stationary unit cell with periodic boundary conditions. The case of flow between two surfaces, one of which is textured, has been investigated in [4]- [7]. A positive effect of surface texturing on the lubricated contact performance is found in almost all the cases analyzed. Siripuram and Stephens [4] analysed protruding and recessed asperities of different shapes using Reynolds' equation. These asperities had heights of the order of the film thickness. The friction coefficient was found to be very sensitive to the asperity area fraction. In a study of corrugated surfaces, Phuoc Huynh [5] pointed out that the load can be increased when the corrugated surface is well located on a fixed-incline slider bearing. Nevertheless, by introducing such a pattern, comparison with the smooth case is not reasonable since the global film thickness is reduced such that pressure increases when the corrugation amplitude increases. Yu and Sadeghi [6] studied the effect of grooves on load support for a thrust washer with focus on groove depth, width, shape and quantity. An optimum groove depth providing maximum load support was found as well as an optimum number of grooves. Brajdic-Mitidieri et al [7] studied the influence of the convergence ratio and position of a pocket on the global friction coefficient for a pocketed pad bearing. Pocket depth and position were also found to be of importance for reduction in the friction coefficient.\n\nA number of the studies focus on the analysis of a texture in a sliding contact with particular attention on the dimensions and the position of the texture. Tonder [8,9] pointed out that introducing a series of dimples or roughness at the inlet of a sliding surface contact can generate extra pressure and thus support higher load. As shown by Brizmer et al [7], a partial texturing creates a collective dimple effect and results in a \"step-like\" pressure distribution over the textured zone. Dimple dimensions were considered by Etsion et al [10]- [12] who showed that dimple depth is an important factor for load generation. There exists an optimal depth for which the dimples can provide the highest load carrying capacity as underlined by Yu and Sadeghi [6]. Sahlin et al [13] showed that recirculation occurs at a certain value of groove depth close to which maximal load is achieved. The dimple width is also found to be of importance in most of the studies. The variation of the dimple depth, with a diverging gap followed by a converging gap, has been considered to be responsible for the pressure generation [14].\n\nFinally, some theoretical and experimental studies on journal bearing have shown the benefits of using some textured surface. Some experimental results with microtextured surfaces showed improved bearing performance [15,16,17]. Longitudinal grooves notched on a rheometer were able to reduce friction [15]. Snegovskii and Arnautova [16] reported that dimples machined on the shaft surface allowed a significant increase in load carrying capacity for a journal bearing operating at high speeds. This work was then continued with tests of the same bearing in the low speed range [17]. According to the authors, frictional losses were reduced by 10 to 15% with a dimpled shaft whereas the load capacity was improved by a factor of 1.5 to 2 at high sliding speeds.\n\nTo model these textured contacts, different approaches have been used. Some effects have been shown to be necessary to take into account in order to get realistic and accurate results. In many studies, Reynolds or Stokes equations are employed neglecting pressure gradient across the lubricating film and inertia effects. However, Arghir et al [14] has shown that Stokes equations are inadequate to predict pressure build-up with the presence of macro-roughness as inertia effects can be of importance. Inertia effects induce a dissymmetry in the pressure profile which results in a positive load onto the upper sliding surface. This finding was confirmed later by Sahlin et al [13]. Olver et al [18] showed that inlet suction is an effect responsible for load support for a parallel pad bearing with a closed pocket. Hirayama et al [19] carried out theoretical and experimental investigations of a spiral-grooved journal bearing and showed that cavitation also needs to be taken into account in the model in order to get good agreement with experimental results.\n\nThe kind of textured contacts that are used in this study are illustrated in Figures 3.  Figure 3.3: Inclined textured slider bearing geometry Chapter 4\n\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate how the introduction of a textured surface influences the performance of a journal bearing. An analysis of deep and shallow dimples created on the stationary surface is performed with different configurations. Geometry as in Figure 3.2 is used. The conclusions from this study are:\n\n• Reduction in friction coefficient is observed for deep dimples located in the maximum pressure region at high eccentricity ratios and for shallow dimples located just downstream of the maximum film at low eccentricity ratio.\n\n• An effect of additional pressure build-up generated by the surface texture has been identified at low eccentricity ratios.\n\n• The optimum design of the textured surface depends on operating conditions. A range of eccentricity ratios providing improvement in hydrodynamic performance can be recommended for both deep and shallow dimples.\n\nThe goal of Paper B is to explain the mechanism of pressure build-up due to texture in an inclined slider bearing. The mechanism at the origin of the optimal load carrying capacity is analysed. This study enables explanation of the additional pressure buildup effect created by the dimples at low eccentricity ratios found in Paper A. The geometry used is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The following conclusions are made:\n\n• The mechanism of pressure build-up due to texture is similar to that obtained with variation of the convergence ratio for smooth surfaces.\n\n• Pressure is built up in the inlet part of the contact due to a positive variation of the mechanical energy. Lower losses in the inlet than in the outlet part creates this mechanical energy variation.\n\n• Pressure gradient decreases when recirculation occurs, i.e. when too large values of the dimple depth or the convergence ratio k are used.\n\nThis paper analyses a textured slider bearing for a lubricant flow with temperature dependent properties. Since the dynamic viscosity, the density and the specific heat capacity of the lubricant are temperature dependent, a variation of them is expected through the contact. A temperature distribution through the contact is shown in Figure 4.1. The frictional losses are then expected to vary as well as the pressure build-up and the load carrying capacity. The goal is then to compare the performance between the isothermal and thermal case regarding the load carrying capacity and the frictional losses. In this study, it has been found that:\n\n• Thermal performance of a parallel surface contact can be improved by using a texture at the inlet.\n\n• The load carrying capacity and the frictional losses are reduced when thermal effects are considered for k = 0 and k = 0.1.\n\n• There exists a critical shear rate at which load carrying capacity of the textured contact becomes zero.\n\n• This critical shear stress is dependent on the convergence ratio, the lubricant viscosity-temperature coefficient and the reference dynamic viscosity. Chapter 5\n\nThe overall conclusions from this study are as follows:\n\n• A suitable position of the texture in a contact with a suitable depth improves the bearing performance. The occurance of flow recirculation in the texture does not generate the highest pressure gradient. Therefore dimples should not be placed in the recirculation zone.\n\n• The optimal design of the surface shape in order to obtain the highest load carrying capacity is based on the control of the losses in the contact.\n\n• Load carrying capacity of a parallel surface contact can be improved by using texturing at the inlet when thermal effects are considered. But there exists a critical shear rate at which load carrying capacity of the textured contact becomes zero.\n\nCHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS Chapter 6\n\nAs the goal of the study is to develop a realistic model for textured surfaces, a few more points deserve some particular attention for further investigation:\n\n• A complete thermohydrodynamic study for a three-dimensional textured journal bearing would be worth analysing. A few interesting questions could be immediately raised: would the optimum position of the dimple remain the same as in the two-dimensional isothermal case? How will the effect of the texture be influenced by the temperature of the inlet flow in the bearing?\n\n• Since the mechanism of pressure build-up and the effect of a texture positioned on the stationary surface has been intensively investigated, the idea about positioning the texture on the moving surface could be worth trying. The heat generated through the contact might be transported differently by the texture. The bearing might be cooled down in a better way which could lead to better performance. For this idea, a moving mesh technique is required with CFD.\n\nPaper A\n\nConformal contacts like those found in journal bearings are widely encountered in various types of machines from small engines to large turbines.

Yu and Sadeghi [4] studied the effect of grooves on load support for a thrust washer with focus on groove depth, width, shape and quantity. An optimum groove depth providing maximum load support was found as well as an optimum number of grooves. Brajdic-Mitidieri et al. [5] studied the influence of the convergence ratio and position of a pocket on the global friction coefficient for a pocketed pad bearing. Pocket depth and position were also found to be of importance for reduction in the friction coefficient.\n\nIn many studies, Reynolds or Stokes equations are employed neglecting pressure gradient across the lubricating film and inertia effects. However, Arghir et al. in [6] have shown that Stokes equations are inadequate to predict pressure build-up with the presence of macro-roughness as inertia effects can be of importance. This finding was confirmed later by Sahlin et al. [7] who also presented an optimization of the geometry. Hirayama et al. [8] carried out theoretical and experimental investigations of a spiral-grooved journal bearing and showed that cavitation also needs to be taken into account in the model in order to get good agreement with experimental results. Some experimental results with micro-textured surfaces also show improved bearing performance [9]- [11]. Longitudinal grooves notched on a rheometer were able to reduce friction [9]. Snegovskii and Arnautova [10] reported that dimples machined on the shaft surface allowed a significant increase in load carrying capacity for a journal bearing operating at high speeds. This work was then continued with tests of the same bearing in the low speed range [11]. According to the authors, frictional losses were reduced by 10 to 15% with a dimpled shaft whereas the load capacity was improved by a factor of 1.5 to 2 at high sliding speeds.\n\nSurface texturing seems to be a promising way of improving the performance of journal bearings. However, a complete study of a textured journal bearing has not as yet been undertaken using the full Navier-Stokes equations and a cavitation model. Therefore a numerical study of a journal bearing with a series of dimples created on the stationary surface is carried out. The focus of the work is the effect of surface texture on hydrodynamic lubrication in terms of the load carrying capacity and friction. An analysis for deep and shallow dimples is performed. Dimple position, width and depth are investigated for the deep dimples. Different eccentricities are also considered for both cases.\n\nThe code used for the simulations is CFX 10.0. No Reynolds or Stokes assumptions are made in the equations. The momentum equation ( 1) coupled with the continuity equation ( 2) is solved over the domain using the finite volume method. Isothermal conditions are applied and the flow is laminar and steady.\n\nThe cavitation model used is the Rayleigh-Plesset model [12] which is a multiphase flow model. Lubricant vapour is produced by air bubbles when pressure falls under the saturation pressure p sat . The multiphase model is chosen to be homogeneous. In this case, all fluids share the same velocity and pressure field.\n\nIn these equations the index α refers to the quantity related to the phase α. The global density and dynamic viscosity are given by the following:\n\nwhere r α is the volume fraction of phase α; N p is the number of flow phases (two in the present case). The sum of the volume fractions of the different phases have to be equal to unity such that:\n\nTherefore equation ( 1) is unchanged but calculated with the density and the dynamic viscosity from equations ( 5) and (6). Equation ( 2) becomes a sum over all the phases and a mass transfer term between the phases is added:\n\nwhere Γ αβ is the interphase mass transfer from phase α to β derived in the same way as in reference [12].\n\nA two-dimensional geometry used for the simulations has identical dimensions as in the experimental work of Jakobsson and Floberg [13]. The lubricant properties are also as in [13]. The flooded bearing used in their work had a length l = 0.133 m, the shaft radius was R s = 0.05 m, the radial clearance c = 0.145 mm, the eccentricity ratio ε = 0.61 and the angular velocity ω = 48.1 rad/s. The lubricant used had a density of 840 kg/m 3 and a dynamic viscosity of 0.0127 Pa s. The surface texture adopted in this work is a series of 10 dimples on the surface of this 2D bearing. The distance between dimples does not exceed 10% of their width. A 2D textured model can be seen in Figure 1(a). The shape of the dimples is chosen to be circular as this would be relatively easy to manufacture and is quite convenient from a meshing point of view. A dimple is characterized by its width (w) and depth (d) as shown in Figure 1(b). A dimensionless parameter which arises is the ratio of the dimple depth to the minimum film thickness, d/h min . Thus, our study consists of two parts: a case with deep dimples such that d/h min > 1 and a case with shallow dimples such that d/h min ≤ 1.\n\nThe following parameters are calculated for a fixed eccentricity: the load carrying capacity (W ), the friction force (F r ) and the friction coefficient ( f ). The load carrying capacity is calculated from the integration of the pressure acting on the shaft.\n\nThe friction force is calculated from the torque acting on the shaft.\n\nThe friction coefficient is the ratio of the friction force divided by the load carrying capacity.  A comparative study is then carried out in terms of the ratio between a parameter of the dimpled geometry to a parameter of the corresponding smooth geometry. Parameters studied are the load, friction and friction coefficient. The ratios are: W /W 0 , F r /F r0 and f / f 0 .\n\nThe model is validated with the experimental results of Jakobsson and Floberg [13].\n\nThe fluid saturation pressure used in the model is p sat = 20000 Pa which corresponds to a sub-ambient pressure. The density of the lubricant vapour is set to 1.2 kg/m 3 and its dynamic viscosity to 2 • 10 -5 Pa s. In the experiments, the bearing was loaded with a constant load of 2250 N. As can be seen in Figure 2, pressure predicted by CFD closely follows experimental points, including within the cavitation region with a constant pressure. Moreover, less than 0.5% difference in the predicted load implies a very good agreement between CFD and experimental results.\n\nIn order to get mesh independent results, the grid used should be of fine quality. Therefore mesh refinements are made inside the dimples to adequately resolve the gradients occurring at the inlet and outlet sections of the dimples. A finer mesh is also required in the cavitation region as a multiphase flow mixture is created. A mesh dependency study has been performed for the smooth 2D case. The grid resolution used for the smooth case in the rest of this work is such that it produces an error of around 0.5% for the load and friction and around 1% for the friction coefficient. Similar grids are used for the dimpled cases except that the mesh is finer inside the dimples. The parameters used are presented in Table 1.\n\n3 Results\n\nDimples with a width of 0.004 m and a ratio of depth to minimum film thickness of 30.1 are introduced in the rising, falling and maximum pressure region parts. Pressure profiles are presented in Figure 3. For all the cases, the dimples flatten the pressure profile locally and maximum pressure is affected. The results for load carrying capacity, friction and friction coefficient are compared with the smooth case in Table 2. The configurations where the dimples are located in the rising and falling parts   of the pressure profile give a strong reduction in load compared to the reduction in friction. As a result the friction coefficient is significantly increased by 18.2% and 12.5% respectively. This leads to deterioration in hydrodynamic performance. On the contrary, when dimples are located in the maximum pressure region, load is reduced less than friction which gives a decrease in friction coefficient and improves bearing performance. Thus, deterioration of the journal bearing performance occurs when the positioning of the dimples deviates from the maximum pressure location. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained by Brajdic-Mitidieri et al. [5] for a pad bearing with a large pocket. The optimal position of the pocket in terms of friction coefficient reduction was found in [5] to be in the maximum pressure region.\n\nFurther analysis is then carried out with dimples located in the maximum pressure region. The pressure profiles for 10 dimples located in the maximum pressure region are presented in Figure 4 for different ratios of depth to minimum film thickness (Table 3). The corresponding smooth case is also represented in the graphs.\n\nThe dimples have a direct effect on the pressure distribution as the profile is truncated in the region of maximum pressure. The higher the ratio of depth to minimum film thickness, the flatter the truncation in the pressure profile becomes. It can also be observed that this truncation simultaneously gives higher pressure in the region of minimum lubricant film thickness while the cavitation zone is shortened, starting later downstream than in the smooth case. The results for load carrying capacity are shown in Figures 5 and 6. For all dimple widths, the load decreases when the depth increases. After a certain value of depth the load stops decreasing and become nearly constant. When the width of the dimples increases, the load decreases slowly. At dimple widths greater than 0.004 m the load decreases at a faster rate. This accelerated reduction in load comes from the fact that the large dimples truncate pressure profile to a greater extent in the region of maximum pressure. It also provokes a lower maximum pressure with wide dimples. Load is reduced by up to 11% for the widest and deepest dimples used.\n\nThe results for friction can be seen in Figures 7 and 8. In all cases, the presence of the dimples reduces the friction as the shear stress at the shaft/lubricant interface decreases due to a local increase in film thickness. For all dimple widths studied, reduction in friction occurs at a faster rate when the depth of the dimples starts increasing. The rate becomes lower for deeper dimples, ending up with an almost constant friction. The shear stress on the shaft is in fact directly affected by dimple depth as the velocity profile, which controls it, is also depth and width dependent. For all dimple depths, the friction decreases linearly when the dimple width increases. The reduction in friction is about 17% for the widest and deepest dimples.\n\nThe friction coefficient is presented in Figures 9 and 10. The value of the friction coefficient is always lower than that in the smooth case. A reduction in friction force is more significant than the reduction in load, so the coefficient of friction is also Figure 6: Non dimensional load as a function of dimple width for different depth to minimum film ratios Figure 8: Non dimensional friction as a function of dimple width for different depth to minimum film ratios Figure 10: Non dimensional friction coefficient as a function of dimple width for different depth to minimum film ratios\n\nreduced. For all dimple widths studied, the friction coefficient decreases when the dimple depth increases. For every depth, the friction coefficient initially presents a decrease when the dimple width is increased until w = 0.004 m. Above this value, friction coefficient increases. The growth of the friction coefficient for dimples of width larger than 0.004 m can be explained by the fact that the loss in load carrying capacity becomes more significant compared to a reduction in friction. An increase in load reduction is observed in Figure 6 for dimple width greater than 0.004 m whereas the rate of reduction in friction stays constant (Figure 8). Thus, a minimum value of f is found for every dimple depth at the critical width of w = 0.004 m. The greatest decrease in friction coefficient is of about 8.1% and occurs at this critical width. The influence of eccentricity ratio on friction coefficient is shown in Figure 11. The dimple configuration used is w = 0.004 m and d/h min = 20.3. It is seen that an increase in the friction coefficient is observed at low and high eccentricity ratios. Therefore, for this dimple configuration, there is a range of eccentricity ratios, from about 0.37 to 0.75, for which improvement in friction coefficient is achieved. However, causes for the gain in friction coefficient, when the eccentricity ratio is outside its range of gain, need to be understood. The reason is that with a different eccentricity ratio the attitude angle and maximum pressure location are changed. Then, the dimples are no longer located in the maximum pressure zone. This situation leads to a configuration like that in Figure 3 where a load decrease is much larger than a friction decrease for dimples located outside the maximum pressure zone.\n\nAccording to some previous studies on plane pad bearings running parallel to the counter face, roughening the inlet part provides a positive lift [14]. Shallow dimples placed at the inlet of the pressure zone, i.e. just downstream of the maximum film thickness of the bearing, may then also provide a positive lift. Investigation is done for two different dimple depths.\n\nFigure 12 presents the pressure profiles for 10 dimples of width w = 0.004 m and depth to minimum film thickness ratio of 0.34 and 1. The eccentricity ratio used is kept to 0.61. It can be seen that the pressure curves always stay under the pressure Table 4: Dimples located just downstream of the maximum film of the bearing, w = 0.004 mm and ε = 0.61 Load Friction f d/h min = 0.34 -2.3% -1.2% +1.2% d/h min = 1 -5.2% -1.8% +3.7%\n\ncurve of the smooth case. More pressure is lost when the depth of the dimples is increased. The corresponding results of Table 4 show that the friction coefficient is not improved with this configuration. Shallow grooves don't reduce so much the friction at the lubricant/shaft interface as the reduction goes from 1.2% to 1.8% for the cases tested. They also don't seem to be able to enhance the load carrying capacity for this eccentricity ratio. The load capacity is reduced to a greater extend for the dimple depth to minimum film ratio equal to 1, as could be guessed from the pressure profile. As a result, a stronger reduction in lift force compared with the reduction in friction force makes the friction coefficient decrease. Previous thoughts about an increase of load carrying capacity for such a dimple configuration seem to be dependent on other parameters. Eccentricity ratio is likely to be one of them since no converging ratio was used in [14]. So an investigation of the eccentricity ratio for this dimple configuration is done next.\n\nIn real situations, it is known that pressure distribution, maximum pressure and friction are affected by operating parameters such as eccentricity ratio. Bearing performance is then also investigated for different eccentricity ratios. In Figure 13, the eccentricity ratio is reduced to a value of 0.1 while the other parameters are the same as previously. The ratio of depth to minimum film thickness is set to 0.34 and the width of the dimples is kept at 0.004 m. A positive effect on pressure distribution can Figure 13: Pressure profile for 10 dimples located just downstream of the maximum film, with d/h min = 0.34, w = 0.004 m, ε = 0.1 be observed. The dimples are responsible for generation of a high pressure gradient. Some extra pressure can then be created. It should be noted that due to the low eccentricity, no cavitation occurs. Load carrying capacity is then significantly increased by 14.5% (Table 5). As the pressure generation due to the dimple seems to be eccentric- ity dependent, an investigation on the influence of the eccentricity ratio is made. All parameters are kept constant except the eccentricity ratio which is tested for different low values. Contrary to load, friction is not a determinant factor in this case as it is only slightly reduced in almost all the cases (Table 5). The reason for why friction is slightly increased at eccentricity ratio 0.2 is because cavitation starts occurring at this eccentricity and a noticeable difference is observed between the smooth and the dimpled case. Dimples which lift the pressure curve give a much shorter cavitation region for the dimpled case at this eccentricity. Dynamic viscosity is then not reduced as much as for the smooth case. In addition, it gives higher friction locally and compensates the loss in friction due to the dimples. In Figure 14, the friction coefficient Figure 14: Non dimensional friction coefficient as a function of eccentricity ratio for 10 dimples located just downstream of the maximum film, with d/h min = 0.34, w = 0.004 m decreases when the eccentricity ratio decreases and is even converging towards the zero value as the dimples are able to sustain a load at zero eccentricity. At higher eccentricity ratios, the rate of reduction in the friction coefficient is decreasing. At even higher eccentricity, the friction coefficient becomes higher than that for the smooth case. This change occurs at a critical eccentricity ratio of about 0.25 and provokes a deterioration of hydrodynamic performance. A positive effect whereby friction coefficient can be significantly reduced and hydrodynamic efficiency improved is then highlighted up until the maximum critical eccentricity ratio is reached.\n\nTo understand why reduction of friction coefficient only occurs below a critical eccentricity, one needs to investigate in detail the load, the main factor contributing to the change of friction coefficient in this case. Figure 15 represents the load as a function of eccentricity ratio for both the smooth and the dimpled cases. The difference between these two cases is also plotted. The load generated by the dimpled Figure 15: Load as a function of eccentricity ratio for 10 dimples located just downstream of the maximum film, with d/h min = 0.34, w = 0.004 m case is greater than that generated by the smooth case until the critical eccentricity ratio of 0.25 is reached. The load then becomes lower at higher eccentricity ratios. The difference between these two curves shows the direct influence of the dimples on the load. It is interesting to note that dimples have a positive effect on the load at low eccentricity ratio since they are responsible for a load enhancement. This effect decreases as the eccentricity ratio increases, becoming negative at eccentricity ratios above 0.25. Dimples are then no longer able to enhance load carrying capacity but, on the contrary, they decrease it. Until reaching the critical eccentricity, dimples create an additional effect responsible for extra pressure build-up and load generation.\n\nEccentricity is an important factor in the design of textured bearings. The external applied load determines the eccentricity ratio for a given bearing's geometrical parameters. Depending on the resulting eccentricity ratio, one can design deep or shallow dimples in order to provide improvements in hydrodynamic performance. If high eccentricities are used, deep dimples can be placed in the region of maximum pressure. The exact eccentricity ratio determines the location of the highest pressure and hence that of the dimples. An inadequate positioning of the dimples can lead to deterioration in hydrodynamic performance as discussed previously. Nevertheless, a range of eccentricities, where gain on the friction coefficient is observed, can be recommended. Thus, a system can sustain a variation in load, i.e. variation in eccentricity ratio and location of maximum pressure, and can still provide a significant improvement in hydrodynamic performance.\n\nThe performance of a 2D textured journal bearing was studied in terms of its friction coefficient. It is found that:\n\n• Textured surfaces affect the journal bearing performance. Reduction in friction coefficient is observed for deep dimples (d/h min > 1) located in the maximum pressure region at high eccentricity ratios and for shallow dimples (d/h min ≤ 1) located just downstream of the maximum film at low eccentricity ratio. The textured surface also affects the cavitation zone.\n\n• The optimum design of the textured surface depends on operating conditions. A range of eccentricity ratios providing improvement in hydrodynamic performance can be recommended for both deep and shallow dimples.\n\n• An effect of additional pressure build-up generated by the surface texture has been identified at low eccentricity ratios.\n\nΓ αβ Interphase mass transfer from phase α to β ε Eccentricity ratio (= e/c) μ Fluid dynamic viscosity [Pas] ω Angular velocity [rad/s] ρ Fluid density [kg/m 3 ] θ Circumferential coordinate [rad] c Radial clearance [m] d Dimple depth [m] d/h min Dimple depth to minimum film thickness ratio e Eccentricity [m] f Friction coefficient (= W /F r ) F r Friction per unit length [N/m] h min Minimum film thickness [m] l Bearing length [m] N p Number of flow phases p Fluid pressure [Pa] P sat Fluid saturation pressure [Pa] r Radial coordinate [m] R s Shaft radius [m] r α Volume fraction of phase α u i Velocity component in the i direction [m/s] W Load per unit of length [N/m] w Dimple width [m] x i Coordinate in i direction [m] z Axial coordinate [m]\n\nPaper B\n\nIn a previous study [1], an additional effect of pressure build-up generated by a surface texture has been identified for journal bearings at low eccentricity ratios. An improvement in the hydrodynamic performance was achieved due to the texture in the converging gap of the journal bearing. Introducing textured surfaces in various hydrodynamic contacts has recently been the subject of many studies since surface texturing may improve bearing performance.\n\nA number of the studies focus on the analysis of various textured geometries with particular attention on the dimensions and the position of the texture. Tonder [2,3] pointed out that introducing a series of dimples or roughness at the inlet of a sliding surface contact can generate extra pressure and thus support higher load. As shown by Brizmer et al [4], a partial texturing creates a collective dimple effect and results in a \"step-like\" pressure distribution over the textured zone. Dimple dimensions were considered by Etsion et al [4,5,6] that showed that dimple depth is an important factor for load generation. There exists an optimal depth for which the dimples can provide the highest load carrying capacity as underlined by Yu and Sadeghi [7]. Sahlin et al [8] showed that recirculation occurs at a certain value of groove depth close to which maximal load is achieved. The dimple width is also found to be of importance in most of the studies. The variation of the dimple depth, with a diverging gap followed by a converging gap, has been considered to be responsible for the pressure generation [9].\n\nIn the other studies, some new mechanisms or effects are highlighted. Analysis of one single cell with a dimple or pocket showed that inertia effects induce a non antisymmetrical pressure profile which results in a positive load onto the upper sliding surface as shown by Arghir et al [9]. Olver et al [10] showed that inlet suction is the effect responsible for load support for a parallel pad bearing with a closed pocket.\n\nWhile the positive effect of dimples on hydrodynamic contacts has been widely proved, mechanisms of pressure generation have only been roughly covered. Better understanding is necessary for a suitable optimization of hydrodynamic contacts. Therefore, the objective of this paper, which is a continuation of the previous work [1], is to explain a mechanism of pressure build-up in a convergent gap due to texture. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code is used to numerically analyse the fluid flow. Firstly, a smooth case is investigated for different convergence ratios.The effect of dimples is then analysed for different depths and convergence ratios. In both cases, special attention is given to the variation of the mechanical energy. The load carrying capacity is compared for the different slider bearing geometries.\n\nThe Navier-Stokes (1, 2) and continuity (3) equations are solved over the domain using the finite volume method with a second order scheme. Isothermal conditions are applied and the flow is assumed laminar and steady.\n\nThese equations are solved with the software package CFX 10.0 [11]. Cavitation is not considered since the pressure never drops under saturation pressure for such a type of configuration as shown in [1]. The following dimensionless parameters are introduced:\n\nwhere h 0 and L represent the outlet height and the length of the domain respectively. The Reynolds number Re = ρUh 0 μ allows the equations to be written in a dimensionless form.\n\nFor a smooth case, assuming h 0 L and Re = O(1) (in the present case Re = 1), equations (4) and ( 5) reduce to the well known equations:\n\nWith the boundary conditions u * (0) = 0 and u * (1) = 1, the solution of ( 7) gives a parabolic velocity profile (9).\n\nThe non-dimensional load carrying capacity W * , calculated in the following, is given by\n\nA two dimensional model is used to represent a sliding contact with a convergent gap. The smooth slider bearing geometry is represented in Figure 1. The dimensions are: length L = 6 mm, outlet height h 0 = 0.03 mm and inlet height\n\nwhere k is the convergence ratio defined by\n\nk-values of 0.1, 0.2, 1 and 2 are chosen to cover a broad range of typical values for a slider bearing. The lower surface is located at y = 0. The upper surface, not parallel to the x-axis, has each of its point located at y = h(x). The upper surface has a velocity U = 3 m/s and the fluid moves with the same velocity at this boundary. At the lower surface boundary, the velocity of the fluid is set to zero. At the inlet and outlet of the domain, the pressure is set to be ambiant. A condition of zero relative pressure is chosen. In the inlet of the converging contact, backflow may occur. Therefore a condition allowing the fluid to cross the boundary in either direction is set with the \"static pressure\" option. With this option, the direction of the flow at the inlet is obtained by enforcing the velocity gradient perpendicular to the boundary as zero [11].\n\nThe textured slider bearing geometry with 3 rectangular dimples located close to the inlet is represented in Figure 2. The width of each dimple is set to 0.3 mm, whereas the depth d is varied such that d/h 0 = 0.75, 0.33 and 0.1. This represents dimples smaller than the minimum flim thickness. The first dimple is located at 0.2 mm from the inlet and the distance between each dimple is set to 0.4 mm.\n\nThe space discretization, i.e. meshing of the domain, induces an error on the numerical simulation. An estimation of this error is possible with a Richardson extrapolation. This method is used to investigate the value of the load for a smooth geometry with k = 1. As the real value of the load is not known, this method is expected to give the exact value and enables estimation of the grid error [12]. The value of the non-dimensional load is plotted in Figure 3 for grids of 1500, 6000, 24000 and 96000 elements. The value of the load error for the grid of 24000 elements is estimated to be 0.3%. The error is small enough to consider the results reliable. This grid is used since it is less time consuming for the calculations. 3 Smooth slider bearing\n\nIn order to understand the effect of the texture in convergent surfaces, smooth convergent surfaces with variable convergence ratio are first studied.\n\nThe variations of the non-dimensional load carrying capacity W * , function of the convergence ratio k, are known. They are shown in Figure 4.\n\nThe load carrying capacity increases until a value of k between 1 and 1.5 is reached. It then decreases. An analysis of the flow is thus required to understand Figure 4: Non-dimensional load for different convergence ratios k the existence of the maximum value of the load carrying capacity. Such an analysis will also allow a better understanding of the effect of surface texturing on load carrying capacity.\n\nThe convergent geometry induces a pressure variation in the domain since inlet and outlet pressure are equal and the mean velocity u, given by ( 10), varies along the convergent geometry.\n\nAt the location of maximum pressure, the pressure gradient is zero and according to equation ( 9) the velocity profile is linear. Due to the constriction, the vertical velocity v is negative. v decreases in magnitude as y decreases due to the stationary wall. ∂v * ∂y * is negative and from the continuity equation ( 6), ∂u * ∂x * is positive. The velocity u, as well as its average u, increases along the x-axis since the mass flow is conserved through each cross-section.\n\nAs the equation of the velocity profile is parabolic, this indicates a concave shaped velocity profile from the inlet of the domain to the linear profile. A convex shaped velocity profile is found after the linear profile. Velocity profiles at different cross-sections of the domain for k = 1 are presented in Figure 5 to illustrate the explanation. In this case the linear profile is found at x * = 2 3 . For a concave profile, located upstream of the linear profile, the velocity variations are small close to the stationary surface. They increase continuously, with large values obtained close to the upper surface. The second derivative of the velocity is thus positive. The pressure gradient is also positive according to equation (7). Located downstream of the linear profile, the variations of the velocity are large close to the stationary surface. They decrease continuously, with small values obtained close to the upper surface. The pressure gradient is thus negative, following equation (7).\n\nPressure, together with load carrying capacity, is thus created in the fluid film of a smooth inclined slider bearing. The continuous increase of the mean velocity induces larger losses since these are proportional to the square of the velocity. The increase of the mean velocity coupled to the variation of the pressure indicates variation of the mechanical energy\n\nThe variation of the mechanical energy may be obtained from the energy equation. Multiplication of the Navier-Stokes equation by the velocity vector U and rearrangement of the different terms gives the energy equation (11), see Cervantes and Gustavsson [13] for a detailed derivation.\n\nThe left hand side term of equation (11) represents the variation of the mechanical energy of the fluid. The first term of the right hand side is a time dependent term.\n\nThe second is a term relating to transport of the fluid. The last term is the mechanical losses. The non-dimensional form of ( 11) is given in equation ( 12) taking into account the assumption h 0 L.\n\nIn equation ( 12), the term on the left hand side represents the variation of the mechanical energy. The first term of the right hand side represents the spatial transport of energy while the last term is the viscous losses. In Figure 6, the average of the 3 terms is plotted for different cross sections of the domain for k = 1. The \"-\" sign indicates energy loss, such that losses are increasing along the x-axis, as expected, since the mean velocity increases. On the other hand, the variation of the mechanical energy decreases monotonously starting from a positive value to finish at a negative value at the end of the domain. When the variations of the mechanical energy are positive, the fluid receives energy from the moving wall and builds-up pressure. As this term becomes negative, energy is still received by the fluid from the wall. However, the significant increase in the magnitude of losses involves a decrease of pressure. A pressure rise is then created when the mean variation of the mechanical energy is positive, followed by a pressure drop when this quantity becomes negative. The variation of the mechanical energy is a function of the axial velocity u * and its vertical variation according to equation (12). A modification of the convergence ratio k will affect the vertical variation of the axial velocity and consequently the variation of the mechanical energy and pressure build-up.\n\nThe effects of the convergence ratio are now investigated for different values. The pressure profiles for different k are represented in Figure 7. For k = 0.1, the pressure profile is almost symmetric. The position of maximum pressure corresponding to the linear velocity profile is nearly centred in the domain. As the convergence ratio k increases, i.e. h 1 becomes larger, the maximum pressure increases as expected since the vertical variation of the axial velocity is more important. Meanwhile, it is also shifted towards the outlet of the domain. In every case, the energy received by the Figure 7: Pressure profile for different k value fluid from the wall is the same. However, when k is reduced to 0.1, more energy is converted into losses compared with the case of k = 1, see Figure 8. Since the entraining wall remains relatively close to the stationary wall, the viscous effects are always important. For k = 1, the magnitude of the losses (in Figure 6) is less in the major part of the contact since the viscous effects close to the stationary wall are smaller as the gap between the surfaces is more important.\n\nHowever, for k = 2, the pressure gradient decreases at the inlet of the domain, as seen in Figure 7. As shown in figure 9, a large zone of recirculation is formed at the inlet of the domain. This recirculation zone is not present in the other cases, see Figure 10. The recirculation zone close to the stationary wall creates a line where u is zero. A flow rate q 1 is going backward under this line. In order to fulfil the mass continuity, the same quantity of flow rate is added to the flow going forward. This means that the global flow rate Q is equal to Q = (Q + q 1 )q 1 . Thus, the quantity of flow going forward (Q +q 1 ) is higher and is filling the velocity profile above the point where u = 0. The shape of the velocity profile becomes less concave above this point. Pressure gradient is then decreased in the inlet when k increases beyond the value of 1, see Figure 7. For the pressure gradient value, recirculation in the flow is thus equivalent to a reduction of k. The position of p max is shifted downstream, so that the magnitude of p max together with the load carrying capacity reach their maximum value after k = 1. This explains the maximum value of the load carrying capacity in Figure 4. Figure 9: Negative velocity (in grey scale) along the x-axis for k = 2  10: Velocity profile at the inlet of the contact. In this particular case, the vertical coordinate is non-dimensionalised by using the inlet height, not the outlet height as previously.\n\nThe hypothesis of thin film does not apply to dimpled slider bearings. The convective terms cannot be neglected due to large variation of the velocity with sudden variation of the geometry. The full Navier-Stokes equations need to be considered.\n\nTo model a textured surface, three dimples are introduced near the inlet of the slider bearing, see Figure 2. Convergence ratios and dimple depths are varied. The resulting pressure profiles are presented in Figure 11 for k = 0.1 and 0.2. In both cases, a great amount of extra pressure is generated within the dimples. This amount increases until a certain dimple depth is reached. The differences in non-dimensional load between the smooth and textured case are presented as functions of k for different d/h 0 ratios, Figure 12. Non-dimensional load values are shown in Table 1.   For the four k-values chosen, the load increases with k until k = 1 and decreases after that. The dimple depth is an important parameter. The effect on the load with d/h 0 increasing depends on the value of k: at k = 0.1, load increases with d/h 0 ; at k = 2, load decreases with d/h 0 ; and for k = 0.2 and 1, an increase in load is followed by a decrease when d/h 0 increases. Dimples produce a significant change in the load carrying capacity for low convergence ratios k = 0.1 and 0.2, where gain goes up to 74% and 32% respectively. Marginal load carrying capacity is lost for high convergence ratios compared with the smooth case. The variation of the load gain is then dependant on the convergence ratio. The same behaviour was observed in [1] for the case of a journal bearing where a gain in load was achieved at low eccentricity ratios and a decrease at higher eccentricities.\n\nBy modifying the shape of the surface with dimples, vertical variations of the axial velocity are different. The vertical velocity v increases in magnitude at the inlet edge of the dimple with a negative value in order to fill the dimple. At the outlet edge of the dimple, a positive vertical velocity is found. See Figure 13(a) where the flow field is represented. The derivative ∂v * ∂y * has thus a positive value at the inlet of the dimple and a negative value at its outlet. The opposite is true for the derivative ∂u * ∂x * due to the continuity condition. The mean velocity decreases from the inlet of the dimple and increases at the outlet. As the mean velocity decreases, the velocity profile becomes more concave. The second derivative of the velocity takes a greater value inducing a higher pressure gradient inside the dimple which implies that more pressure is generated.\n\nAs seen in Table 1, the gain in the load is not always positive. For k = 2, some load carrying capacity is lost independently of the dimple depth. For the case of k = 1, some load is lost only for the largest dimple depth, i.e. for d/h 0 = 0.75. The vertical velocity v has a positive value at the inlet edge of the dimple, as seen in Figure 13(b). The contrary effect occurs when the line u = 0 and the backflow spread out of the dimple.\n\nA recirculation zone occurs in the dimples when the depth reaches a certain value. Figure 14 represents the non-dimensional velocity at the centre of the first dimple for different dimple depth and convergence ratios. Velocity profiles are similar in the two other dimples. A recirculation zone is always present when d/h 0 = 0.75 as can be seen in Figure 15. Increasing the depth of the dimples stretches the flow more and tends to generates a recirculation zone. The recirculating flow in such geometry has been fully studied by Shankar and Deshpande [14]. This backflow has the same effect as for the smooth case described in the previous section. It leads to a lower pressure gradient and lower pressure generation. For the textured case, this decrease in pressure gradient is realised locally in the dimples. Thus the load generated is lower, explaining the results of Figure 12.\n\nAs soon as recirculation occurs in the dimples, increasing the depth reduces the pressure gradient locally. Nevertheless, when no recirculation is found in the dimples (for low values of k), increasing the pressure gradient and the load carrying capacity is still possible by increasing the dimple depth. Indeed the velocity profile can still be stretched until the limit where recirculation begins to occur. Introducing dimples in a global recirculation zone, see Figure 15(c), generates even more backflow and reduces the load carrying capacity.\n\nDue to the texture, a strong change in mechanical energy, losses and energy transport is observed in the dimples, see Figure 16. The negative magnitude of the losses is significantly reduced in the dimples for k = 0.1. On the contrary, only a slight reduction in losses magnitude is noticeable at a convergence ratio of k = 1. Consequently, the variation of the mechanical energy is increased inside the dimples for the case of k = 0.1 whereas it is slightly decreased for the case of k = 1. This means that more energy is converted into mechanical energy to build up pressure in the case of k = 0.1. The pressure gradient generated is higher. It should be noticed that the variation of the mechanical energy becomes negative earlier upstream compared with the smooth case. Pressure is thus decreasing earlier upstream as can be seen in Figure 11.\n\nBoth the convergence ratio and the dimple depth have an optimum value to generate the highest load. In both cases, modifying k or the dimple depth leads to a change in velocity profile and pressure gradient.\n\nDimples have to be placed at the inlet of the contact in order to generate pressure build-up. If dimples are placed after the linear velocity profile, load carrying capacity will decrease. This can be explained as follows. Dimples in the outlet part of the converging gap decrease the magnitude of the losses locally. Thus, the negative variation of the mechanical energy increases in the outlet. A lower amount of energy is dissipated at a lower rate in the outlet, so the fluid takes less energy to build up pressure in the inlet of the converging gap. Lower pressure will be generated leading to lower load carrying capacity.\n\nThe shape of the stationary wall defines the velocity profile. It is possible to choose a shape which produces a steep pressure gradient at the inlet of the converging gap (with a concave velocity profile stretched to the limit where recirculation begins to occur) and a strong negative pressure gradient in the second part of the domain. In the first part of the domain, the losses need to be minimized to build up the pressure. If texture is applied here, the texture depth can be as deep as possible, but should not allow any recirculation in order to generate the largest pressure gradient. In the second part of the domain, some amount of energy of the fluid has to be converted into losses in order to decrease the pressure towards its reference value of zero. A series of dimples can be used for the texture. However, considering the optimisation of the load support, a pocket would give a greater load since the same pressure gradient can be created and maintained over a longer distance. A series of dimples is then only a local optimisation of the surface shape. Moreover, in order to keep the pressure gradient constant in the first part, the bottom surface of the pocket needs to remain parallel to the moving wall.\n\nWhen a global recirculation zone occurs, the creation of some dimples in this zone leads to some decrease in load as was shown for the case of k = 2. Nevertheless, recirculation is often unavoidable in some machine components such as journal bearings. If the reduction of k is not possible, some beneficial effects can be achieved by creating a texture outside the recirculation zone and before the point of maximum pressure. It can thus lead to some pressure gain. For k = 1, the flow is at the limit of recirculation at the inlet of the domain. Increasing the convergence ratio would decrease the pressure gradient. For such a configuration, improvement can be achieved. At the inlet of the converging gap, keeping a constant height maintains the same velocity profile and a constant pressure gradient. This height is conserved until the point of the linear velocity profile and retakes its original value after that, see Figure 17.\n\nThe results indicate an increase of 9.8% of the load compared with the smooth case. For k = 2, an identical shape is created after the recirculation zone until the location Another way to improve significantly the performance of a slider bearing with a textured surface is to suitably introduce the texture in the high pressure region. Friction force is reduced more than load carrying capacity when the texture depth is much larger than the minimum film, as was shown by Spikes et al in [15] for a slider bearing and by Cupillard et al [1] for a journal bearing. Friction coefficient is thus improved.\n\nOptimisation work has already been performed on parallel surfaces in [8]. This study also enables an explanation as to why \"the splined geometry\" with an upstream displacement of the deepest point of the groove produces a higher lift force than the other \"splined geometries\" in the work performed by Sahlin et al [8]. The \"splined geometry\" with an upstream displacement of the deepest point of the groove generates a high pressure gradient earlier upstream compared with the other geometries. The pressure rise is greater in the inlet part of the groove for this geometry, whereas it increases at a lower rate for the other \"splined geometries\". It results in a higher pressure at the groove location and a higher load carrying capacity. For the configuration of groove centred in the domain, the groove with a rectangular shape of the same depth gives the highest load carrying capacity.\n\nFor a step bearing, a modification of the height of the step acts like a modification of the convergence ratio for an inclined bearing. The Rayleigh step bearing is known to have the optimum surface profile of the stationary wall, giving the highest load. A step bearing produces a triangular shaped pressure profile since constant pressure gradient is positive until the step and negative after. The velocity profile is stretched to its maximum in the first part giving the highest possible pressure gradient. The losses are minimized before the step, where mechanical energy increases, and maximized after. If there is a deviation from the optimum configuration of the step bearing, a pocket before the step is likely to improve the load carrying capacity provided that there is no backflow.\n\nTo extend the idea of decreasing the losses as much as possible in the first part of the contact, a heterogeneous slip/no-slip surface positioned in a parallel slider bearing significantly increases the load carrying capacity, as shown by Salant and Fortier in [16]. The introduction of a slip surface significantly decreases losses in the inlet part and keeps high losses to the second part. Therefore more energy taken from the wall is used to build-up pressure in the fluid film. The velocity profile is stretched to a greater extend leading to a larger pressure gradient. Thus, higher pressure is generated and load carrying capacity is improved.\n\nA mechanism of pressure build up has been explained for a smooth, convergent hydrodynamic contact and for a contact with a textured surface. The Navier-Stokes equations have been used to solve the flow for different convergence ratio values and for different dimple depths. A general optimisation of the wall profile shape is possible in many hydrodynamic contacts (such as journal bearings) in order to get improvement of the load carrying capacity. It has been found that:\n\n• Mechanism of pressure build-up in a convergent gap between two sliding surfaces due to texture is similar to that obtained with variation of the convergence ratio for smooth surfaces.\n\n• As the fluid receives energy from the moving wall, lower losses in the inlet than in the outlet part produce positive variation of the mechanical energy in the inlet part and pressure is built up.\n\n• Pressure gradient decreases when recirculation occurs, i.e. when a too large value of the dimple depth d or the convergence ratio k is used. Lower pressure is generated locally.\n\n• Wall shape controls the velocity profile which determines the pressure gradient and the pressure build up by means of the continuity equation.\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), the Research Council of Norrbotten (Norrbottens Forskningsråd) and the Swedish Electricity Utilities Research and Development Company (Elforsk).

As a result, the contact can carry a load while keeping friction as low as possible. With no convergence in the gap, load carrying capacity is zero. It has been shown that surface texturing can provide pressure build-up in parallel surface contacts. Theoretical results reported so far for textured contacts are isothermal and show some improvement of hydrodynamic performance [1]- [11]. Generation of heat takes place in such a contact as was shown for a step bearing by Dobrica and Fillon [12]. Temperature is in fact increasing through the contact due to shearing of lubricant. Since the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant is temperature dependent, variation of the viscosity is expected through the contact. Frictional losses are then expected to vary as well as the pressure build-up and the load carrying capacity. The question is then of how much these quantities are affected.\n\nThe influence of thermal conditions has not yet been investigated for textured geometry. Thermal performance of a textured contact together with inertia effects requires further investigation. The present work focuses on the study of a twodimensional inlet textured contact with special emphasis on thermal effects. The results obtained for different values of shear rate and convergence ratio are analysed and compared with isothermal results.\n\nThe code used to model the problem is CFX 10.0. The Navier-Stokes equations, momentum equation ( 1) coupled with the continuity equation ( 2), are solved over the domain together with the energy equation (3), using the finite volume method. The flow is considered laminar, steady and two dimensional.\n\nwhere δ i j = 1 when i = j, and 0 when i = j. The total enthalpy is calculated by the following expression:\n\nwith 1  2 V 2 representing the kinetic energy. The static enthalpy is calculated by integrating the following expression:\n\nThe geometry used is that of a textured slider bearing with 3 rectangular dimples located in the inlet region, Figure 1. The following dimensions are used: L = 6 mm (length of the domain) and h 0 = 0.03 mm (height of the domain). The convergence ratio is defined by\n\nThe width of each dimple is set to 0.3 mm, whereas the depth d is set such that d/h 0 = 0.75. This represents dimples smaller than the minimum flim thickness. The first dimple is located at 0.2 mm from the inlet and the distance between the dimples is set to 0.4 mm. Boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes equation At the walls boundary, no slip is assumed between the lubricant and the wall. The upper wall translates with a velocity U along the x-axis. The lubricant, in direct contact with the wall, moves with the same velocity. The lubricant has zero velocity at the lower wall boundary. Ambient pressure is imposed at the inlet and outlet of the domain. The velocity gradient perpendicular to the inlet boundary is set to zero in order to impose the flow direction.\n\nBoundary conditions for the energy equation Yu and Sadeghi [13] showed, for a thrust washer, that the temperature of the \"runner\" is nearly constant. It was also shown that variations are not significant in terms of impact on bearing performance according to Tucker and Keogh [14]. A constant temperature of 50 • C is set at the upper wall. As the inlet of such contacts is usually cooled, a temperature profile, varying from 40 • C at the lower wall to 50 • C at the upper wall, is taken at the inlet boundary.\n\nAt the lower wall boundary, adiabatic conditions are assumed:\n\n∂T ∂y lower wall = 0\n\nThermal effects require careful modelling since many quantities such as viscosity, density, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the lubricant are temperature dependent. Their influence has been estimated by modelling one dimple cell with factorial design. Factorial design is a statistical method to evaluate the influence of one factor (main effect) and the interaction of factors (joint effect) on representative quantities. Results obtained show that the viscosity has the largest influence on all the quantities evaluated. A significant joint effect appears with the interaction between viscosity, density and specific heat capacity.\n\nThus the fluid is modelled with temperature dependent viscosity, density and specific heat capacity, whereas the lubricant conductivity is set at the constant value of λ = 0.13 W m -1 K -1 . The expressions in Table 1 are chosen to describe variation of the lubricant properties with temperature.\n\nTable 1: Variation of lubricant properties with temperature Viscosity\n\nIn order to estimate performance of the system under different shear rates, load carrying capacity W and friction F r , given in equations ( 6) and (7) respectively, are integrated at the upper wall.\n\nW = L 0 p dx (6) F r = L 0 μ ∂u ∂y dx (7)\n\nTheir corresponding non-dimensional values are given by:\n\nThe non-dimensional temperature in the contact is calculated as follows:\n\nThe shear rate is given by: γ = U h 0\n\nThe space discretization, i.e. meshing of the domain, induces an error into the numerical simulation. An estimation of this error is possible with a Richardson extrapolation. This method is used to investigate the value of the load for the contact geometry with zero convergence (k = 0) and a velocity set to U = 5 m/s. As the real value of the load is not known, this method is expected to give an approximation of the exact value and enables estimation of the grid error [15]. The value of the non-dimensional load is plotted in Figure 2 for grids of 3360, 13440 and 53760 elements. The value of the load error for the grid of 53760 elements is estimated to be 1.5%. The error is small enough to consider the results reliable. This type of grid is used in the following workscope. 3 Results and discussion In Figure 5, the non-dimensional load carrying capacity is compared for the isothermal and thermal cases. In both cases, presence of texture in the inlet part of the contact has a positive effect on load carrying capacity compared to the smooth case. There are however some differences. For the isothermal case, non-dimensional load stays constant whereas a decrease in load is observed for the thermal case. The magnitude of the non-dimensional load is significantly reduced for the thermal case. The ability of the fluid to carry a load is decreased. It can be observed that nondimensional load becomes zero at a certain shear rate for a convergence ratio k equal to zero. This fact is attributed to the significant difference in dynamic viscosity at the inlet and outlet of the contact. Since dynamic viscosity is much lower in the outlet part of the contact, Figure 3, losses are decreased much more at the outlet than at the inlet of the contact. To build-up pressure, the energy of the moving wall needs to be converted into mechanical energy at the inlet of the contact [16]. Thus, losses need to be reduced at the inlet of the contact while they should be kept at a higher level at the outlet of the contact in order to decrease the pressure. In this case, losses decrease at the outlet while pressure gradient increases at the outlet and decreases at the inlet of the contact. Thus, load carrying capacity is decreased when thermal effects are considered. When load carrying capacity becomes zero, this mechanism dominates the effect of pressure generation created by the texture or gap convergence. Lack of load carrying capacity results in a decrease in minimum film thickness. As a consequence of higher shear rate, temperature will increase and dynamic viscosity will decrease, leading to even thinner films and finally to a collapse of the lubricant film. Vanishing of load carrying capacity can also be expected for k larger than zero for a higher shear rates since the non-dimensional load curve is monotonously decreasing.\n\nThus, there exists a critical shear rate γ c , k dependent, at which the fluid film may collapse. The system operates at a safer level when the k-value is increased. It should be mentioned that, with U increasing, the dimensional load is constantly increasing for the isothermal case whereas it presents a maximum for the thermal case. This maximum is located near the value of U = 5 m/s for k = 0 and U = 10 m/s for k = 0.1.\n\nAs the viscosity-temperature dependency has the strongest influence on the flow, Figure 7: Non-dimensional friction as a function of shear rate\n\nThe flow recirculation zone inside the dimples is decreased when heat transfer conditions are considered. It is also decreased when the upper wall velocity is increased. When heat transfer is considered, the more the upper wall velocity is increased, the more the heat increases through the contact and the more the dynamic viscosity is decreased. Thus, the lubricant has the ability to be accommodated into the sudden change of surface shape inside the dimples. The height of the recirculation zone in the dimples is thus reduced. In this case, the efficiency of the dimples is improved according to results from a previous study [16].\n\nA thermal study of an inlet textured contact has been performed for a flow of lubricant with temperature dependent viscosity, density and specific heat capacity submitted to temperature variations. The results obtained were compared with the isothermal case. It has been found that:\n\n• Load carrying capacity of a parallel surface contact can be improved by using texturing at the inlet for both isothermal and thermal cases.\n\n• The load carrying capacity and the frictional losses are reduced when thermal effects are considered for k = 0 and k = 0.1.\n\n• There exists a critical shear rate γ c at which load carrying capacity of the textured contact becomes zero.\n\n• The critical shear rate is dependent on convergence ratio k and lubricant properties such as β and μ 0 . Some ways to increase it can be realized by increasing k or reducing β and μ 0 in order to extend the safe operating zone.\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), the Research Council of Norrbotten (Norrbottens Forskningsråd) and the Swedish Electricity Utilities Research and Development Company (Elforsk).
