Howewr, so\" antigens, such as the androgen receptor (AR), lose their immunoreactivity during the routine processing, including formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (1).\n\nAndrogens are functionally crucial to several organs and tissues (2). ARs are expressed at variable but relatively low levels in a number of tissues (1). Owing to rapid developments in cell and tumor biology, there is an urgent need for immunohistochemical studies of AR in various target organs, particularly in male accessory sex glands and in tumors such as prostate cancer. Unlike the established prognostic significance of estrogen receptor status in breast cancer (3), the clinical correlation of AR status in prostate cancer with response to hormone therapy and prognosis remains unclear (4-8). This has been attributed to the heterogenous distribution and intensity of AR immunostaining in prostate cancer tissues (6).\n\nSupported by the Swedish Cancer Foundation and the Maud & Birger Gustamson Foundations.

MW In addition, it has been demonstrated that stromal cellsofthe prostate also posses ARs and are regulated by androgehs to secrete epithelial growth factors in a paracrine fashion (9). This androgenregulated epithel&interstitiaIal interaction may play a significant role in the growth and development of prostate cancer (9). In contrast, expression of estrogen receptor appears to be restricted to the epithelial cells but not to stromal cells of the breast (10)..The antigenic epitopes of AR used to.generate antibodies are sensitive to formalin fixation, which prohibits its routine use on formalin-fxed, paraffin-embedded material (1). Therefore, in previous immunohistochemical studies of the AR, frozen tissue sections were used (4-8.11-13). However, not only do paraffii-embedded sections provide better preservation of tissue morphology than do frozeh sections but they can be examined retrospectiwly, and may contribute to more reproducible results. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect 0fmiuowaVC (MW) irradiation (14,15) on enhancing AR immunoreactivity in formalin-fixed, p d i nembedded tissue and to ascertain AR status in a variety of tissues.\n\nTissue Specimens. Fresh tissue samples used in this study wcrc obtained at operation and biopsy. They included prostate (5). seminal vesicle ( 5 ) , epididymis (2), testis (2). breast (5). placenta (2), male skin (2), adrenal gland (2). liver (2), and spleen (2). The tissue specimens were conventionally processed for routine histopathologic procedures, i.e., fiied in buffered formalin for <24 hr, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (5-pm thickness) onto glass slides (ProbeOn Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). A second kind of prostate tissue specimen consisted of 10-year-old archival paraffin block with materials from prostate cancer radical prostatectomies. In each case, at least five specimens of adjacent normal prostate parenchyma were taken and further immunostained as described below.\n\nAntibodies. The mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) F39.4.1 (Sanbio; Amsterdam, Netherlands) was originally developed by Zegers and associates (16), using as an immunogen a synthetic peptide conjugate corresponding to amino acids 301-320 of the N-terminal domain of human AR. The specificity of F39.4.1 for human AR is well established, and it does not crossreact with the estrogen, progesterone, or the glucocorticoid receptor (1,13,15). The basal cell-specific anti-cytokeratin mouse MAb 34BE12 (17) was obtained from Enzo Diagnostics (Syosset, NY) and the mouse MAb to smooth muscle actin (1A4) from Dako Corporation (Carpinteria, CA).\n\nMicrowave Heat Treatment of Tissue. As previous studies have shown that the AR antibody F39.4.1 yields intense immunostaining in frozen sections of male accessory sex glands (1,14), normal prostate tissue was used in our study to evaluate the &a of MW heat treatment of AR immunoreactivity. Tissue sections placed on glass slides were oven-baked at 65'C for 30 min to prevent tissue detachment during MW treatment. The slides were deparaffinited, rehydrated in water. and incubated with 3% Hz02 for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After rinsing with water, the slides were placed in a glass dish filled with either water, PBS, 1% zinc sulfate (14), or citric acid monohydrate (citrate buffer; pH 5, pH 6, and pH 7, respectively) (15). Tissue sections were boiled in an M W oven (800 W, 2.45 gHz) (General Electric Co., Model JEM21K) for 5-60 min at full power. After each lo-min interval, distilled water was added to compensate for the loss of buffer volume due to evaporation. The slides were allowed to cool and rinsed with PBS.\n\nImmunohistochemistry. AR was identified with sueptavidin-peroxidase conjugate method (18) as described previously (19). Anti-AR F39.4.1 was used at a dilution of 1:40. Biotinylated horse antibody to mouse IgG (1:200) (Vector; Burlingame, CA) was used as the secondary antibody. Positive staining was visualized with the enzyme conjugate sueptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch; San Francisco, CA), followed by 3-amino-9-ethylcarbozole (AEC) as the chromogen. Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary and secondary antibody, respectively, which showed no immunostaining. Double Immunohistoch&try. To identify the basal and stromal cells, monospecific antibodies to either cytokeratin (34BE12, 1:50 dilution) or smooth muscle actin (1A4, 1:50 diiution) were used and doubleimmunostained with antibody to AR. After the color development of the AR staining with AEC, slides were incubated with the second-primary antibody overnight at 4'C. The second immune complex was visualized with the streptavidin-B-galactosidase conjugate receptor system (Kirkegaard & Perry; Gaithersburg, MD). Since the primary antibodies are of the same species (i.e., monoclod/monoclonal combinations), crossreactivity is possible in theory. However, if the antigens of interest are in different cellular compartments (nudear vs cytoplasmic), any signifcant crossreactivity should be readily apparent, and we have seen none. Evaluation of Immunostaining. Immunohistochemically stained sections were reviewed by two independent observers. Only nuclear staining was uanslated as positive AR immunoreactivity. The degree of immunostaining was designated by semiquantitative analysis as strong (+ + ), moderate (+ ), or no ( -) immunoreactivity, or as variable (+ + I -, + I -).\n\nThe effects of MW heating and choice of boiling solution on the outcome of AR immunostaining are shown in Table 1. No immunostaining was observed in sections not exposed to MW heating (data not shown) or in those heated for <10 min. However, AR immunoreactivity restricted to the cell nuclei was observed when tissue sections were treated at 20 min in PBS and at 10 min in citrate buffer, pH 6-7. The optimized staining condition was obtained by citrate buffer, pH 6, at 30 min. In contrast, water, 1% zinc sulfate, and citrate buffer, pH 5 , failed to enhance AR immunoreactivity. MW heating >30 min did not improve the intensity of immunostaining but decreased preservation of tissue morphology. Moreover, tissue sections detached from the slides when samples were boiled for 60 min.\n\nUnder optimized conditions of 30-min MW in citrate buffer, pH 6, the stability of the antigen in paraffin blocks was determined using lo-year-old archival tissue specimens. No obvious difference in staining quality was noted between freshly processed and archival material (data not shown).\n\nThe immunohistochemical localization of AR in various tissues is summarized in Table 2. The present results were compared with those previously obtained by others using the same human AR MAb, F39.4.1, but in frozen sections (1). Male reproductive organ tissues exhibited intense immunoreactivity to F39.4.1. In prostate, the nuclei of secretory epithelial cells were consistently stained (Figure 1). Double immunocytochemistry with F39.4.1 and anti-cytokeratin 34PE12, specific to the basal cell layer, yielded either weak or no AR immunostaining of basal cells (Figure 2). Variable immunoreactivity was also observed in prostate stromal cells, a subpopulation of which co-expressed actin, indicating them to be AR-positive smooth muscle cells (Figure 3). Another (i.e., AR-positive, actinnegative) subpopulation of the stromal cells may be predominantly prostate fibroblasts. A similar pattern of AR distribution was observed in seminal vesicle and epididymis (Figure 4).\n\nPositive nuclear staining was also observed in Leydig cells and Sertoli cells in the testis. In contrast, immunoreactivity in germ cells and myoid cells was relatively weak. We noted strong staining in the rete testis. Acinar and duct cells of the breast (Figure 5 ) and sebaceous and sweat gland of the skin (Figure 6) exhibited strong staining, whereas adrenal gland, liver, and spleen revealed no im- munoreactivity with F39.4.1.\n\nTable 1.

Very recently, reports describing a similar technique for AR immunostaining in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissue have been published (20,21). The present study was performed independently of these recent reports and we can therefore confirm that this method is highly reproducible. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that this technique can be used successfully for evaluating the AR status in a variety of other human tissues. There were no obvious differences in staining quality between newly fixed tissues and archival tissues embedded in paraffin for 10 years. Therefore, retrospective AR immunohistochemistry can be performed. Kimura and co-workers (22) reported that pretreatment of tissue sections with 10% pronase digestion significantly enhanced AR immunoreactivity of a polyclonal antibody in 4 % paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. We have tested the effect of various proteases and detergents, including uypsin, pronase, pepsin, saponin, and Triton X-100, on the enhancement of AR immunoreactivity with F39.4.1, although none of these procedures worked efficiently in the specimens used in this study (data not shown). Previously, we reported that cold acetone can be used before paraffin embedding to preserve the antigenic epitopes of the AR (23). However, preservation of tissue morphology was inferior compared with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.\n\nUsing MW heat treatment of tissue section, we obtained highly specific immunostaining, with staining patterns very similar to those previously reported by others using frozen tissues (1). The AR status of basal cells in the epithelial lining of the prostate is controversial, as both positive (22,24) and negative (1,4,11) immunostaining have been reported by several groups of researchers. In our study and others (5,12,13), variable basal cell staining was observed. Various antibodies, fixatives, and tissue preservation techniques were used in these studies and might explain the different degree of basal cell staining. The presence of AR in Sertoli cells and Leydig cells of the testis is consistent with data from previous immunohistochemical studies (1,21) and in vitro studies using these cells in culture (25). Lack of AR in germ cells suggests that the effect of androgen on spermatogenesis may be mediated indirectly. It has been postulated that spermatogenic action of androgen is mediated through Sertoli cells (1). We observed a strong AR staining in the rete testis, which had not been reported previously. Our results demonstrated that myoepithelial cells and stromal cells of the breast, and hair follicles of the male skin, have no AR. In contrast, Kimura et al. (22) have observed strong AR immunostaining in these cells using a polyclonal antibody (NH-27). Since our findings are consistent with a previous study by Ruizeveld de Winter et al. (I), which used the same antibody (F39.4.1) as we did, this apparent discrepancy may be attributed to the difference of primary antibodies but not to the difference of tissue preparation. Although mRNA for AR has been identified in adrenal gland, spleen, and liver (22), our study failed to demonstrate AR immunostaining in these tissues. It is possible that expression of AR protein by these tissues may be under detectable levels.\n\nThe exact mechanism whereby MW oven heating enhances AR antigenicity is unclear. However, the effect appears to be based on the heating of the specimen, most likely the cleavage of cross-lmkages caused by formalin fixation (20). AR immunoreactivity was never visualized when the duration of MW treatment was short <lo min). The choice of boiling solution may also be a significant factor. We tested several solutions that have been used in previous antigen retrieval studies (14,15). Although both water and 1% zinc sulfate have been shown to enhance immunoreactivity in other groups of antigens, these solutions failed to enhance AR immunoreactivity. It is likely that these solutions may not be suitable for antigen retrieval of nuclear proteins in formalin-fixed tissue (20).\n\nThe original report by Shi and colleagues (14) described how, by using MW oven heat treatment, a significant improvement of immunostaining in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sec-tions had been obtained with a wide variety of primary antibodies. Therefore, as the MW effect is not specific for AR immunoreactivity, MW-processed tissue sections can be used for double immunostaining with AR antibodies in combination with others. This may be particularly important in assessing AR status in certain tissue cell populations, as AR is ubiquitously distributed in the human body (1,22,24). In the present study, AR immunostainingwas performed in combination with antibodies to actin or cytokeratin. We noted that immunoreactivity of both actin and cytokeratin was also significantly enhanced by MW heating.\n\nFinally, the MW method used in this study to enhance AR antigenicity is very simple and cost-effective. The M W oven used was a conventional 800-W domestic model. As specimens can be kept boiling during the treatment, no temperature monitoring or cooling systems are required. In addition, the boiling solution used consisted of citric acid monohydrate, a chemical ordinarily available in most laboratories. Moreover, a large number of specimens can be processed simultaneously with this procedure, thus minimizing intra-assay variation in immunostaining.\n\nn.e. n.e. + + I -+ + -+ a Signs denote strong ( + + ), moderate ( + ), no ( -), immunoreactivity or variable ( + + / -, + / -) immunoreactivity. n.e.. not examined.\n\nby guest on October 27, 2014 jhc.sagepub.com Downloaded from"
