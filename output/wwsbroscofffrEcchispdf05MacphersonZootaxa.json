    "abstract": "Twenty-two species of the genus Munidopsis from the Atlantic Ocean are studied. Five new species are described (M. anemia, M. exuta, M. hirtella, M. laurentae and M. truculenta), and diagnoses and illustrations of some relatively rare species (M. acuminata, M. bairdii, M. livida, M. parfaiti and M. thieli) are provided. None of the species discussed here is restricted to a particular habitat, including species collected from hydrothermal vent (M. acutispina, M. exuta) and cold seep areas (M. acutispina, M. geyeri, M. hirtella, M. livida, M. marionis). The new records of some species greatly extend the previously known distribution range of the species (i.e., M. abyssicola, M. aries, M. bairdii, M. geyeri, M. livida, M. parfaiti, M. thieli). Finally, some biological and biogeographical data for the different species are discussed.",
    "full_text": "The galatheid crabs of the genus Munidopsis Whiteaves, 1874, distributed worldwide in all deep-sea habitats, is one of the most diverse genera of the family Galatheidae (Baba 1988(Baba , 2005)). Species of this genus are commonly found living on the continental slope, usually deeper than 500 m, and on the abyssal plain, > 2000 m (Chace 1942, Miyake & Baba 1970, Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1970, 1971, Baba 2005). They are frequently observed by submersibles during mid-oceanic ridge expeditions and some species have been observed in recently discovered vent and cold-seep communities (Williams 1988, Hashimoto et al. 1995, Chevaldonné & Olu 1996). Despite their ecological importance and high diversity, many aspects of their systematics and distribution are still poorly known (Baba 2005).\n\nThe genus Munidopsis is so far represented in the Atlantic Ocean by more than 70 species, living between 2 m (M. polymorpha Koelbel, 1892) and 5330 m (M. parfaiti (Filhol, 1885) and M. thieli Türkay, 1975). These species have been studied by many authors, either from specimens collected in the eastern Atlantic (e.g., A. Milne-Edwards & Bouvier 1894, 1900, Hansen 1908, Sivertsen & Holthuis 1956, Miyake & Baba 1970, de Saint-Laurent 1985, Tiefenbacher 2001) or the western Atlantic (e.g., A. Milne-Edwards 1880, Chace 1942, Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1970, 1971, Wenner 1982, Gore 1983, Takeda 1983, Pequegnat & Williams 1995, Tavares & Campinho 1998a, b, Navas et al. 2003). Sampling effort in the bathyal and abyssal plains (1000 m to 5330 m), where species of Munidopsis are more common (Baba 2005), has been very sporadic until recently, limiting our knowledge of the distributional ranges of different species, and few data on their biology have been available (Wenner 1982, Gore 1983, Samuelsen 1972, Wilkens et al. 1990, Creasey et al. 2000).\n\nAfter numerous expeditions carried out in the last decades in the deep-waters of the Atlantic Ocean, from Ireland to South Africa, including the hydrothermal vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the cold seep areas of the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Mediterranean Sea and west African equatorial margin, a large number of specimens belonging to 22 species of Munidopsis were found. The present paper includes the occurrences of these species, the description of five new species (M. anemia, M. exuta, M. hirtella, M. laurentae and M. truculenta), and the diagnoses and illustrations of some relatively rare species (M. acuminata Benedict, 1902, M. bairdii  (Smith, 1884), M. livida (Perrier, 1886), M. parfaiti (Filhol, 1885) and M. thieli Türkay, 1975). Finally, the biology and biogeography of various species are discussed.\n\nMost specimens studied here were collected during a large number of French cruises between 1969 and 2004, and some British, German, Russian and American cruises (Table 1). Data collected during French cruises are stored in the database for deep-sea benthic ecological data BIOCEAN, and are available on the website: www.ifremer/isi/biocean. The specimens were caught using diverse kinds of trawls and dredges, by grab or slurp gun of the submersible Nautile and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV Victor), or, more rarely, by baited traps. They were initially fixed in formalin after capture and transferred to ethanol and sorted in the center Centob, LEP-Ifremer. These collections include specimens collected from the hydrothermal vent community of several Mid-Atlantic-Ridge (MAR, Van Dover 1995) sites: Snake Pit, (23ºN, 3500 m), TAG-Kremlin Zone (26ºN, 3650 m), Lost City site (15 km from the MAR spreading axis, 30ºN, 830 m, Kelley et al. 2001, Gebruk et al. 2002); and the Battleship \"Bismark\" wreck site (35°N, 16°W, 4670 m, Sagalevich et al. 2002). Additional material was obtained at cold-seep sites: Florida Escarpment (3288 m; Turnipseed et al. 2004), Congo Fan (2417 m), Regab (west African equatorial margin, off Congo, 3155 m; Andersen et al. 2004, Ondréas et al.2005), and also specimens from a long term colonisation tray, moored at ~2 km from this cold-seep area (A. Khripounoff, pers. com.), and from the Kazan mud volcano (eastern Mediterranean Sea, 1700-2030 m; Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004).\n\nSome ecological data were obtained from the analyses of the video-tapes taken by the submersibles DS Nautile (HYDROSNAKE, 1988, hydrothermal MAR vent site Snake Pit;and FARANAUT, 1992, MAR valley, Fifteen Twenty Fracture Zone), DS Alvin (MAR 93, 1993, vent site Logatchev, 14º45'N, 3020 m), and ROV Victor (BIOZAIRE 2, 2001, coldseep area Regab).\n\nThe specimens, including type material, are deposited in the collections of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris (MNHN). The material collected during the M56 and MAR-ECO cruises has been deposited in the Senckenberg Institute (Frankfurt, Germany) and University of Bergen (Norway), respectively. The types of M. acuminata © 2005 Magnolia Press 1095 ZOOTAXA Benedict, 1902 from the National Museum of Natural History (USNM, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.) were also studied for comparison with M. anemia n. sp. Measurements of specimens represent the postorbital carapace length. Terminology used mainly follows Zariquiey- Alvarez (1952), Baba & de Saint-Laurent (1996), and Baba (2005). Diagnosis. Carapace without dorsal spines, cervical groove indistinct; frontal margins between rostrum and antennal spine transverse, and oblique between antennal spine and anterolateral spine; anterolateral spine followed posteriorly by 2 or 3 spines on hepatic margin and 1 spine on anterior branchial margin. Rostrum wide, dorsally weakly carinated, distally trifid, nearly horizontal but slightly upturned distally. Sternites smooth, unarmed; anterior margin of third thoracic sternite with small granules, slightly wider than anterior margin of fourth sternite. Abdominal tergites unarmed; sixth segment bearing posterolateral lobes somewhat exceeding nearly straight transverse median margin. Telson composed of 7 plates. Eyestalk unarmed, slightly movable, partially concealed by rostrum. Antennal peduncle with distomesial and distolateral spines on articles 1 and 2, strong MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA  . Milne-Edwards & Bouvier 1894, 1899, 1900), and from the Mediterranean Sea (W Tyrhenian Sea, Sardinia) between 374 and 1036 m (Froglia et al. 2002). The present material was collected between 830 and 2030 m. Munidopsis acutispina occurs in both hydrothermal (Lost City, central Atlantic Ocean;Gebruk et al. 2002) and cold seep areas (Kazan mud volcano, eastern Mediterranean Sea; Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004).\n\nMunidopsis anemia n. sp. (Fig. 2) Material examined. Bay of Biscay, BIOGAS 1, Stn CM01, 47º44.3'N, 08º51'W, 1010 m, 04.08.1972: holotype male 34.0 mm (MNHN-Ga 4620), paratype female 3.9 mm.\n\nEtymology. From the Greek aneimon, naked, refering to the smooth surface of the carapace.\n\nDescription. Carapace surface unarmed, without epigastric spines, covered by small rugosities. Short striae on anterior branchial region, longer striae on posterior branchial region, as illustrated. Rostrum wide, dorsally weakly carinated, distally trifid, nearly horizontal but slightly upturned distally; antennal spine present. Oblique frontal margin leading to well-developed anterolateral spine (first spine) slightly larger than antennal spine, followed by 2 spines on anterior part of anterior branchial region, anterior (second spine) of these strong, posterior (third spine) smaller; another small spine (fourth) bordering anterior and posterior branchial regions. Anterior margin of third thoracic sternite with small granules, slightly wider than anterior margin of fourth sternite; fourth thoracic sternite subtriangular. Abdomen smooth; segments 2-4 each with anterior elevated transverse ridge; segment 6 bearing posterolateral lobes somewhat exceeding nearly straight transverse median margin. Telson composed of 7 plates; length-width ratio 0.8. Eyes movable, unarmed; smoothly ovate cornea cupped within broad-based ocular peduncle; cornea relatively large, and slightly wider than third article of antennal peduncle.\n\nBasal article of antennule with distolateral and shorter distodorsal spine; lateral margin slightly swollen. Article 1 of antennal peduncle with distal spines, distolateral spine slightly stronger than distomesial spines; article 2 with well-developed distolateral spine overreaching article 3, not exceeding article 2, clearly longer than distomesial spine; article 3 with strong distomesial spine, overreaching antennal peduncle.\n\nIschium of third maxillipeds with distal spine on flexor border, merus with strong distal spine on extensor margin, two well-developed spines on flexor border, proximal longer than distal; mesial crest with 21-23 denticles.\n\nChelipeds 2.5 times carapace length; merus nearly reaching end of rostrum, with 4 strong terminal spines (2 dorsal, 1 mesial, 1 lateral), some well-developed spines on mesial and dorsal margins; carpus 1.4 times longer than broad, with several distal spines, one additional spine on mesial margin; palm spineless, 2.3 times longer than broad; fingers not acuminated, 0.7 times palm length, distally spooned, prehensile edges crenulated; fixed finger without distal crest on lateral margin.\n\nFirst walking leg clearly not exceeding cheliped. Dorsal crest of meri of walking legs with row of well-developed spines, increasing in size distally; carpi with row of welldeveloped spines along dorsal border, granulate crest along lateral side and not continued on to propodi; propodi unarmed, ca. 1.3 times length of dactyli; each dactylus smoothly narrowed distally, ending in curved sharp spine, flexor margin slightly curving, bearing 5 proximally diminishing spines, each with small movable spinule, ultimate spine rather remote from end of dactylus and much closer to penultimate. Meri of walking legs progressively shorter posteriorly.\n\nEpipod on cheliped; walking legs without epipod.\n\nRemarks. Munidopsis anemia closely resembles M. acuminata from the northwest Atlantic (see above) in having a trifid rostrum, a smooth carapace surface and abdomen, and epipods on the chelipeds. Munidopsis anemia is readily distinguished from M. acuminata by the following characters: -The rostrum is wider (ca. one-third carapace width, measured at base of rostrum in M.\n\nanemia compared to one-fourth carapace width in M. acuminata) and the spines smaller in M. acuminata than in the new species. The rostrum is also longer in the new species (rostrum ca. 0.5 times carapace length) than in M. acuminata (0.3 times carapace length). -The antennal, anterolateral and anterobranchial spines of carapace margins are stronger in the new species than in M. acuminata. -The sternum is narrower in M. acuminata than in M. anemia.\n\n-The basal segment of the antennular peduncle is wider in M. acuminata than in M.\n\nanemia, with two subequal and long distodorsal and distolateral spines, whereas the distolateral spine is longer than the distodorsal spine in M. anemia. -The spines on the segments of the antennal peduncle are longer in the new species than in M. acuminata. The third segment is armed with a well-developed distomesial spine in M. anemia, whereas this segment is unarmed in M. acuminata. -The fingers are more acuminate in M. acuminata than in M. anemia.\n\n-The walking are legs longer and more slender in M. anemia than in M. acuminata. The spines on the flexor border of the dactyli are better developed and less numerous in M. anemia (5) than in M. acuminata (7). Distribution and habitat. The species is only known from the type locality, in the Bay of Biscay, at 1010 m, collected among an abundant bathyal community composed of corals, echinoderms and fishes. as M. beringana), Japan, 3420-3960 m (Baba 1982), Mozambique, off Sri Lanka, Tasman Sea, off Zamboanga, Costa Rica, Gulf of Panama, 366-3800 m (Baba 2005). The present material was collected from the northwestern Atlantic (58º49'N) and Bay of Biscay to the southeastern Atlantic (off South Africa, 32º29'S) between 3134 and 4460 m. No specimens were collected in hydrothermal vent and cold-seep areas (Table 2).\n\nTABLE 2. Species of Munidopsis collected at hydrothermal vent (V), and cold-seep (CS) sites.\n\nMunidopsis aries (A.

Munidopsis aries (A. Milne-Edwards, 1880). Female (91.6 mm), off Mauritania, EUMELI 2, Stn MVN02. Carapace, abdomen and pereiopods, dorsal view.\n\nRemarks. This species was previously known from relatively few specimens: the holotype, a juvenile male collected off Bequia (Caribbean Sea) at 2912 m (A. Milne-Edwards 1880), 6 males, 3 females, and one large ovigerous female collected in the Azores Islands (Sivertsen & Holthuis 1956), Middle Atlantic Bight (Wenner 1982), Colombia and Venezuela Basins and Gulf of Mexico (Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1971, Gore 1983), between 2615 and 4095 m. The species was considered to be a senior synonym of M. sundi by Gore (1983), which was described by Sivertsen & Holthuis (1956) from a large female collected south of Azores Islands. The species is the largest known galatheid. Munidopsis aries belongs to the group of species that have the carapace covered with small granules, without gastric spines, the branchial margin of the carapace posteriorly convergent, the anterolateral corner of the carapace angular, the rostrum with distinctly convex lateral margins, ocular peduncles movable, the main eye-spine on the mesial end of eyestalk well produced, without lateral eye-spine, the cornea relatively small, the first walking leg overreaching end of cheliped, the fixed finger of cheliped without denticulate carina on the distolateral margin, and epipods absent on pereiopods.\n\nDistribution and habitat. The present material extends the distribution range of this species from the North Atlantic to the South Atlantic, with a depth range of 2615-5320 m.\n\nThe WALVIS specimen was collected among actiniarians, gorgonians, polychaetes, gastropods, and macrurid and zoarcid fishes. The ABYPLAINE specimen was found among a low diversity fauna of actiniarians, shrimps, bivalves, and tunicates (Monniot & Segonzac 1985). The BIOZAIRE specimens were obtained in the northern edge of the Zaïre River channel, 6 km south of Regab cold-seep area. During the diving cruise FARANAUT, exploring the axial valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, on both sides of the Fifteen Twenty Fracture Zone, two large specimens were filmed in situ from the sumersible Nautile: dive FR13, 31.03.1992, 15°28.50'N,46°34.10'W, 3824 m, on muddy bottoms, and dive FR20, 07.04.1992, 15°32.80'N,46°41.20'W, 3226 m, on a basalt outcrop (Table 2).\n\nThe female from EUMELI 2, collected off Mauritania, is the largest known specimen of the species. The species was collected together with M. antonii and M. hirtella (this paper), and with M. bermudezi and M. crassa in the western Atlantic (Gore 1983).\n\nMunidopsis bairdii (Smith, 1884) (Fig. 4) Smith, 1884: 356.

Gastric region rather well defined, convex, bearing 3 pairs of spines: median pair of spines smaller than other pairs. Cervical groove distinct. Cardiac region with anterior ridge preceded by distinct groove, bearing pair of spines followed by 1-2 spines in midline. Posterior margin with 4-10 spines and elevated ridge. Front margin strongly oblique; antennal spine absent. Lateral margins slightly convex, each with 4 spines: first slender, present at anterolateral angle, directed anterolaterad, second strong, directed more laterad than first, third and forth short. Rostrum curving dorsad, dorsally moderately carinate, bearing 2-4 lateral teeth.

Telson composed of 8 plates; length-width ratio 0.78; midlateral plate convex on distolateral margin.\n\nEyes not movable; smoothly ovate cornea cupped within broad-based ocular peduncle; peduncle extended into strong but relatively short mesiodorsal spine directed upward at low angle; cornea relatively large, clearly wider than eyespine, and as wide as third article of antennal peduncle.\n\nBasal article of antennule having dorsolateral spine much smaller than ventrolateral. Article 1 of antennal peduncle distomesially bearing flattish process rather straight laterally, somewhat convex mesially, distolateral spine well-developed; article 2 with strong distolateral spine.\n\nThird maxillipeds with weak spination; ischium with distodorsal and distoventral spines, both small, latter in particular; mesial crest with 21-23 denticles. Flexor margin of merus with 5 small spines, extensor distal marginal spine small.\n\nChelipeds longer than carapace including rostrum. Merus nearly reaching end of rostrum, with 4 terminal spines (2 dorsal, 1 mesial, 1 lateral), a few small spines on dorsal sides, covered with scale-like elevated rugosities. Carpus with a few distal and mesial spines. Palm spineless, slightly longer than broad, with small granules along mesial margin. Fingers slightly longer than palm, distally spooned, prehensile edges crenulated; fixed finger moderately ridged along distal third of lateral margin.\n\nFirst walking leg slightly exceeding cheliped by half length of dactylus; dorsal crest of merus with row of small spines, lateral side with granules; carpus with row of spines along dorsal border, two granulate crests along lateral side and continued on to propodus, ventrolateral crest less conspicuous than dorsolateral; propodus nearly twice as long as dactylus, sometimes with spines on proximal half of dorsal margin; dactylus smoothly narrowed distally, ending in curved sharp spine, flexor margin slightly curving, bearing 13 or14 proximally diminishing low spines, ultimate spine rather remote from end of dactylus and much closer to penultimate.

The new species belongs to the group of species having (usually) 2 epigastric spines, epipods on the chelipeds, the cornea distinctly broader than the eyespine, the fixed finger of the cheliped without a denticulate carina on the distolateral margin, the first walking leg overreaching end of the cheliped, the dactyli of the walking legs slightly curving on flexor margin, and the abdominal segment 6 with the posteromedian margin MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA weakly convex, not produced. Munidopsis geyeri Pequegnat & Pequegnat, 1970 from the Caribbean Sea and South and Central Atlantic (see below) is the most similar species geographically and taxonomically, but it is readily differentiated by the following characters (see also Baba 2005): -The rostrum is triangular with a marked dorsal carina in M. geyeri, whereas the rostrum is clearly spiniform, without marked dorsal carina in the new species. -The antennal spine is always present in M. geyeri, but absent in the new species.\n\n-The eyespine is usually longer in M. geyeri than in the new species.\n\n-The posterolateral lobes of the abdominal segment 6 do not reach the posterior median margin in M. geyeri, whereas in M. exuta it distinctly overreaches that margin. -The propodus of the walking legs is nearly as long as the dactylus in M. exuta, whereas in M. geyeri the propodus is 1.3-1.4 times the length of dactylus. M. exuta is also close to M. crassa (see above), but they can be differentiated by the shape of the distal margin of abdominal segment 6: weakly convex in the new species and strongly produced in M. crassa. Furthermore, M. exuta is characterized by the presence of two epigastric spines, the absence of antennal spine, the rostrum not triangular, and the dactyli of the walking legs slightly curving on the flexor margin, whereas M. crassa has some gastric spines, the antennal spine present, the rostrum moderately broadly triangular, and the dactyli of the walking legs clearly curving on the flexor margin.\n\nDistribution and habitat. The species is only known from the northeast Atlantic at 2860-3502 m. This species occurs in both abyssal and hydrothermal vent environments. The BIOGAS specimens were collected in the Bay of Biscay, among actiniarians, polychaetes, brachiopods, molluscans and echinoderms. Two specimens were collected in the vent area of Snake Pit (HYDROSNAKE and MAR93 cruises). The HYDROSNAKE specimen was caught by a baited trap 100 m north of the site Les Ruches, together with the nephropid lobster Thymopides laurentae Segonzac & Macpherson, and the macrurid fish Coryphaenoides armatus (Hector) (Segonzac & Macpherson 2003). The MAR93 specimen was collected from the site Elan, about 100 m west of Les Ruches, at the base of the active edifice, on sulfide rocks, among scattered sea anemones, chaetopterid tubeworms and alvinocaridid shrimps. The two specimens from the AMK47 cruise were collected at the base of an inactive chimney complex, among dead mytilid bivalves. An additional specimen (unfortunately lost) was collected during the cruise BRIDGE 1993, at the hydrothermal vent site Broken Spur site (dive Alvin 2625, 27.06.1993, 29°10'N, 43°10'W, 3056 m; E.

Remarks. The species was synonymized with M. subsquamosa Henderson, 1885 by Ambler (1980). However, more recent studies have demonstrated the validity of M. geyeri as a separate species (Gore 1983; see Baba 2005, for a complete discussion of the taxonomic status of the species).\n\nMunidopsis geyeri belongs to the group of species having the carapace with 2 epigastric spines only, the anterolateral spine small, subequal to the antennal spine in size, directed straight forward, the rostrum spiniform, the abdominal segment 6 with the posteromedian margin weakly convex, not produced, the eyestalks short relative to length, the mesial eye-spine present, the first walking leg overreaching the end of the chelipeds, the fixed finger of the chelipeds without denticulate carina on the distolateral margin, the dactyli of the walking legs strongly curved distally, the ultimate flexor marginal tooth much closer to the penultimate than to the tip of the article, and epipods on the chelipeds.\n\nSize distribution. The specimens collected on the west African equatorial margin, north of the Zaïre River channel, were mostly caught in the trawl CP 20 during the BIOZAIRE 3 Cruise carried out on the Regab cold-seep area. The sex ratio of these specimens was not significantly different from 1:1 (chi-square, p>0.05). However, males were more abundant in the smaller size classes than females (Fig. 6). The ovigerous females were first measured at 31.5 mm.\n\nDistribution and habitat. Munidopsis geyeri was described from specimens collected in the southwest Gulf of Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela Basins and south of Jamaica, between 2650 and 4151 m, (Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1970, 1971, Gore 1983, Baba 2005). The specimens from the Caribbean Sea were caught on bottoms of yellow clay mud, with vegetable debris, and with abundant sponges and holothurians (Gore 1983). The present record extends the geographical range of the species to the South (Gulf of Guinea) and Central Atlantic (Azores Islands). The depth range is 2650 to 4151 m.\n\nThe species also occurs the Florida Escarpment (Gulf of Mexico, 3288 m; Turnipseed et al. 2004) and at the Regab site (Gulf of Guinea, 3150 m, Fig. 14; Andersen et al. 2004, Komai & Segonzac 2005, Ondréas et al. 2005), among an abundant chemosynthetic community associated with cold-seeps. These two communities are similar, characterized MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA by the presence of sea anemones, dense populations of vestimentiferan tubeworms, large mytilid bivalves, gastropods, alvinocaridid shrimps, chiridotid holothurians and zoarcid fish.\n\nThe stomach contents of five specimens collected in the Regab site (BIOZAIRE 3, CP20) showed very small quantities of fine gray sediments. The SEM observations also showed agglomerations of some mineral particles, diatoms, and decapod crustacean remnants, a few small sea-urchin spicules, and five micro-gastropod shells. One microgastropod shell contained flesh probably belonging to Hyalogyrina sp. (Vetigastropoda, Skeneiformes), an inhabitant of reduced environments, and known to graze bacterial film (A. Warén, personal communication). Munidopsis hirtella n. sp. (Fig. 7) Types. The ovigerous male of 32.6 mm from EUMELI 2, Stn CP08 (MNHN-Ga 4622) has been selected as holotype, the other specimens are paratypes.\n\nEtymology.

Pterygostomian flap anteriorly ending in rounded tip, with numerous granules and short ridges.\n\nThird thoracic sternite narrow, forming apposed lobe bearing anteromedian process at either side of deep median groove; depressed below level of, and, separated by deep groove from, anteriorly narrowed fourth thoracic sternite.\n\nAbdomen spineless; segments 2-4 each with 2 moderately elevated transverse ridges, somewhat granulate, and with numerous unirramous setae; no ridge on segments 5-6; segment 6 having well-developed posterolateral lobes, slightly overreaching transverse posteromedian margin. Telson divided into 8 plates, length-width ratio 0.7.\n\nEyes slightly movable dorsoventrally, bearing distomesial eyespine strongly produced forward; cornea well-developed and lateral, distinctly broader than eyespine.\n\nArticle 1 of antennular peduncle with strong distodorsal and distolateral spines, with small tubercle-like spines distomesially. Article 1 of antennal peduncle bearing sharp, distolateral and distolateral spines; article 2 with sharp distolateral spine only exceeding midlength of article 3; article 3 narrower than 2, with small distomesial spine and a few distolateral tubercles.\n\nIschium of third maxilliped more than half as long as merus, bearing strong short spine on extensor distal margin and small spine on flexor distal margin, mesial crest with row of 21 denticles; merus with 3 or 4 spines and 2 or 3 acute granules on flexor margin, and one sharp extensor distal marginal spine; carpus unarmed, propodus relatively slender.\n\nChelipeds covered with small rugae and granules, uniramous setae more dense along mesial and lateral margins; about 1.9 times as long as postorbital carapace length. Basiischium with 2-4 spines on mesial margin, distodorsally with strong spine, distoventral margin at juncture with merus bearing several small spines. Merus slightly overreaching rostrum, armed with spines in rows, distomesial spine strongest. Carpus bearing row of mesial and lateral spines, a few distal spines on dorsal border. Palm with acute granules on dorsal margin, a few small spines along mesial margin, slightly shorter than fingers, less than twice as long as broad. Fingers unarmed, not gaping, distally spooned, prehensile edges crenulate.\n\nWalking legs rather long, slender, subcylindrical; first walking leg overreaching chela. Merus longer on first leg than on second leg, shorter on third than on preceding legs, each bearing dorsal crest with row of spines continued on to corresponding crest on carpus, ventral margin with some spines; each carpus having dorsolateral and dorsoventral granulate crests without spines continued on to corresponding crests on propodus. Each propodus with proximal mesial crest with spines; propodus slightly longer than dactylus. Dactyli slender, gently but distinctly curved, terminating in acute corneous spine preceded by row of 13 or 14 very low, proximally diminishing processes, each process supporting corneous seta, ultimate process clearly closer to tip of dactylus than to penultimate process.\n\nEpipods present on chelipeds. Eggs: Diameter, 2.9 mm Remarks. The sixth abdominal segment without produced posteromedian flap, the first walking leg exceeding the tip of the chela, eyes bearing a well-developed, anteriorly directed distomesial eyespine, and absence of a denticulate carina on the distolateral margin of the chela, link M. hirtella to M. subsquamosa Henderson, 1885 from the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans, between 2516 and 4260 m and M. recta Baba, 2005 from the Gulf of Panama, at 2950-3190 m (see Baba, 2005).\n\nThe new species is easily differentiated from M. subsquamosa by the size of the cornea: it is as broad as the eye spine in M. subsquamosa, instead of being distinctly broader in the new species. Furthermore, the gastric region has more spines in the new species than in M. subsquamosa, and the length of the dactylus of the walking legs is 0.61 that of propodus in M. subsquamosa, whereas in the new species, the dactylus is slightly shorter than the propodus. Finally, the body of the new species has numerous simple setae, whereas these setae are absent in M. subsquamosa.\n\nMunidospis hirtella is differentiated from M. recta by the following characters: -The gastric region and the lateral margins of the carapace have more spines in the new species than in M. recta. -The body has few uniramous setae in M. recta, whereas in M. hirtella the carapace, abdomen and appendages have numerous uniramous setae. -The flexor margin of the dactylus of the walking legs is nearly straight in M. recta, MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA being considerably curving in the new species. Furthermore, the dactylus of the walking legs is about 0.5 times the length of the propodus in M. recta, whereas in the new species the dactylus is three-quarter the length of the propodus. Distribution and habitat. The species has only been reported off western Africa, between Mauritania and Congo, at 3125-3166 m. The EUMELI specimens were collected in a sedimentary area, together with actiniarians, polychaetes, molluscs, shrimps, pagurids, echinoderms ant tunicates (Galéron et al., 2000). The species was collected in the coldseep site Regab, and away from the influence of seepage (1.5 km north and 7.5 km south of the site).\n\nMunidopsis laurentae n. sp. (Fig. 8) Material examined.

Lateral margins nearly straight and subparallel, bearing 5 strong spines on anterior half, first anterolateral, smaller than others, somewhat divergent anteriorly, located distinctly mesial to level of remaining spines, second and third spines largest, directed more laterad than preceding, 1 or 3 small additional spines between large spines. Rostrum moderately narrow, with middorsal ridge, somewhat upturned, length one-fourth that of remaining carapace.\n\nPterygostomian flap anteriorly ending in acute tip. Sternite 3 narrow, forming apposed lobe bearing anteromedian process at either side of slightly deep median groove, depressed below level of, and, separated by deep groove from, anteriorly narrowed sternite 4.\n\nAbdomen spineless; somites 2 and 3 each with 2 moderately elevated transverse ridges; somites 4-6 without transverse ridge; somite 6 with posteromedian lobe transverse, not produced. Telson consisting of 8 plates, length-width ratio 1.01.\n\nOcular peduncles slightly movable dorsoventrally, bearing distomesial eye-spine strongly produced forward. Cornea small and lateral. MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA\n\nBasal article of antennular peduncle with strong distodorsal and distolateral spines, distomesially with a few tubercles. Article 1 of antennal peduncle bearing sharp, basally flattish distomesial spine and very small distolateral spine. Article 2 with sharp distolateral spine only. Article 3 narrower than article 2, with distomesial spine distinctly larger than distolateral spine.\n\nIschium of third maxilliped as long as merus, bearing spine on extensor distal margin and small one on flexor distal margin, mesial crest with row of 16-20 denticles. Merus with 4 sharp flexor marginal spines and 2 sharp extensor distal marginal spines. Carpus unarmed. Propodus relatively slender.\n\nChelipeds covered with small rugae, 2.2 times as long as postorbital carapace length. Basi-ischium unarmed on mesial margin, distodorsally with strong spine, distoventral margin bearing several small spines at juncture with merus. Merus clearly over-reaching rostrum, armed with spines in 3 rows, distomesial spine strongest. Carpus one-third merus length, bearing row of mesial and dorsal spines. Palm with row of mesial, dorsal and lateral spines, as long as fingers, slightly less than twice as long as broad. Fingers unarmed, not gaping, distally spooned, prehensile edge crenulate. Fixed finger without denticulate carina on distolateral margin.\n\nWalking legs rather long, slender, subcylindrical; first walking leg (P2) over-reaching chelipeds and 2.5 times postorbital carapace length. Meri of P2 slightly longer than that of P3 and 1.3 times that of P4, overreaching rostrum, each bearing dorsal crest with row of well developed spines continued on to corresponding crest on carpus, ventral margin with row of spines. Each carpus having dorsolateral crest without spines, continued on to corresponding crest on propodus. Propodus slightly shorther than merus, about 3 times dactylus length, flexor margin with 2 distal movable spinules, extensor margin sometimes with proximal spine. Dactyli slender, gently but distinctly curved, terminating in acute corneous spine preceded by row of 9 or 10 very low, proximally diminishing processes, each process supporting corneous spine, ultimate process slightly more remote from tip of dactylus than from penultimate process; flexor border nearly straight.\n\nEpipods absent from P1-4.\n\nRemarks. The presence of gastric spines on the carapace, the unarmed abdomen, the absence of pereiopodal, the second walking legs overreaching the tip of the chelipeds, the ocular peduncles bearing a well-developed, anteriorly directed distomesial eye-spine, and the absence of a denticulate carina on the distolateral margin of the fixed finger of the cheliped link the species to M. reynoldsi (A. Milne Edwards, 1880) from the Caribbean Sea and Colombian Basin (3700-4277 m), and M. starmer Baba & de Saint Laurent, 1992, from North Fiji Basin at 2750 m (Baba & de Saint Laurent 1992, Tavares & Campinho 1998). Munidopsis laurentae is readily distinguished from M. reynoldsi by the following differences: -The antennal spine is always present in the new species, whereas this spine is absent in M. reynoldsi.\n\n-The first anterolateral spine of the carapace in M. laurentae is clearly shorter than the second and third lateral spines, whereas this spine is as long as the second spine in M. reynoldsi. -The gastric and lateral spines of the carapace are more numerous and better developed in M. laurentae than in M. reynoldsi. -The propodus of the walking legs is about three times the dactylus length in M. laurentae, instead of being about two times in M. reynoldsi.\n\nThe new species is also easily distinguishable from M. starmer by the presence of numerous spines on the gastric region and along the posterior border of the carapace. Munidopsis starmer has only two epigastric spines and the posterior border of the carapace is unarmed.\n\nThe two specimens were collected together with an abundant fauna composed of octocorals, decapods including one Munidopsis bairdii, echinoderms, tunicates and fishes.\n\nDistribution. Only known from the type locality, off South Africa at 3550 m. Specific habitat data are not available.\n\nMunidopsis livida (Perrier, 1886) (Fig. 9)\n\nlividus Perrier, 1886: fig. 242.

Carapace surface unarmed, nearly devoid of setae. Frontal margin oblique lateral to eyestalks; lateral border convex, cristate, overhanging pterygostomian flap.\n\nRostrum very broadly triangular, about one-third as long as remaining carapace, constricted between eyes, horizontal, dorsal carina continued onto anterior gastric region; lateral margin finely serrate. Third sternite with two anterior lobes; fourth sternite narrowly elongate anteriorly, lateral margins concave. Abdominal somites unarmed; posterolateral lobes of somites 6 distinct but not overreaching somewhat convex transverse posteromedian margin. Telson divided into 8 plates, posterior plates combined more than twice as wide as long. Ocular peduncles slightly movable, eyestalks produced anteriorly beyond cornea; cornea moderately small. Antennal peduncle having article 1 with anteriorly produced spine ventrally, dorsolateral margin broadly produced; article 2 MUNIDOPSIS 1095 ZOOTAXA sometimes with distolateral spine, article 3 distolaterally produced, with small distomesial spine. Merus of third maxilliped with small denticular spines of irregular sizes on flexor margin, extensor distal margin with small, acute spine. Chelipeds granulate, spineless, relatively stout, short, about as long as postorbital carapace length; fixed finger with denticulate carina on distolateral margin. First walking legs longer than chelipeds; merus somewhat cristate along extensor margin; extensor margin of carpus cristate; propodus with weak granulate ridge along lateral surface; dactylus ending in curved claw preceded by 13 proximally diminishing spines on nearly straight flexor margin, each spine bearing short seta. Epipods present on chelipeds. Egg diameter 1.8 mm Remarks. Munidopsis livida belongs to the group of species having the dorsal surface of the carapace and abdomen unarmed, the rostrum wide and carinated dorsally, the main eyespine situated on the mesial end of the eyestalk, the fixed finger of the cheliped with denticulate carina on the distolateral margin, the first walking leg overreaching the end of the cheliped, and epipods present on the chelipeds. The closest species of the genus are M. ceratophthalma Alcock, 1901 from the Andaman Sea and West of Sumatra, between 677 and 878 m (Alcock 1901, Doflein & Balss 1913), M. edwardsii Wood-Mason, 1891 from the Bay of Bengal and New South Wales, Australia, between 1379 and 2610 m (Wood-Mason 1891, Alcock 1901, Baba & Poore 2002, Baba 2005), and M. profunda Baba, 2005 from the Celebes Sea, between 5163 and 5243 m (Baba 2005). However, the three species can be easily be distinguished from M. livida by the following characters: -The shape of the rostrum is different. Munidopsis ceratophthalma, M. edwardsii and M. profunda have a triangular rostrum , not covering the eyes, whereas in M. livida the rostrum is wide, nearly covering the eyes. -The dorsal margins of merus and carpus of the walking legs have some spines in M. ceratophthalma, M. edwardsii and M. profunda, whereas these spines are absent in M. livida. -The epipods on the chelipeds are present in M. livida, M. edwardsi and M. profunda, whereas they are absent in M. ceratophthalma. Additionally, M. edwardsii has two epigastric processes, that are absent in M. livida, M. ceratophthalma and M. profunda. Distribution and habitat. Munidopsis livida was described from two specimens (one male and one ovigerous female) collected off the Canary Islands at 2115 m (A. Milne Edwards & Bouvier 1894). The species was subsequently recorded from the Gulf of Mexico, between 2070 and 2790 m (Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1971). The present material extends the known range to the central eastern Atlantic (off Congo).\n\nThe M56 specimen was collected with a TV grab at Congo Fan, about 90 km south of the cold-seep site Regab. The photographs taken around the location of the capture show that the faunal community is similar to that of Regab site, except that mytilid bivalves are apparently absent.\n\nGalathodes Marionis A.

The species was originally known from a few specimens, all collected in the Mediterranean Sea (type locality: Planier Island, near Marseille, northwestern Mediterranean, 450 m). Galil & Goren (1994) redescribed the species from specimens collected in the eastern Mediterranean. Munidopsis marionis belongs to the group of species having the dorsal surface of the carapace granulated, without spines, the rostrum triangular, with the lateral margins weakly convex, the antennal spine absent, the anterolateral spine of the carapace bluntly produced, the abdominal segments spineless, the eyes large, not movable, the eyestalks short, unarmed, the first ambulatory leg reaching the end of the cheliped, and epipods present on the chelipeds and first two pairs of the ambulatory legs.\n\nMunidopsis marionis is very close to M. allae Khodkina & Duris, 1989, known only from one specimen collected southwest of Spain (470-660 m). After the capture of new material of M. marionis (Galil & Goren 1994;this paper), the distinguishing features of M. allae indicated by Khodkina & Duris (1989), e.g., length of pereiopods, eye size, armature of gastric region of the carapace, seem to be invalid. A complete revision of the type material of M. marionis and M. allae is desirable in order to confirm the existence of one or two taxa.\n\nDistribution. Mediterranean Sea, between 374 and 1000 m (A. Milne-Edwards & Bouvier 1894, Galil & Goren 1994, Froglia et al. 2002). The present material was collected in cold-seep areas (Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004).\n\nElasmonotus Parfaiti Filhol, 1885: pl. 7.-Perrier, 1886: 295, 324. Orophorhynchus Parfaiti.-A.

Carapace, abdomen, chelipeds and walking legs spineless, covered with tubercles. Carapace nearly devoid of setae, areas well delineated and convex. Lateral margins convex on hepatic regions, subparallel on branchial regions. Rostrum very broadly triangular, about 1/3 as long as remaining carapace, weakly carinated dorsally, carina not continued onto anterior half gastric region. Abdominal segments 2-4 each with blunt, low median process; posterolateral lobes of segment 6 distinct, and clearly overreaching nearly straight transverse posteromedian margin. Telson divided into 8 plates, posterior plates combined more than twice as broad as long. Ocular peduncles not movable, distally ending in blunt process; cornea lateral. Chelipeds slightly longer than carapace in both sexes, few small spines on mesial and distal borders of merus and carpus; fingers as long as palm, distally hoof-shaped, fixed finger sometimes with low denticulate carina on distolateral margin, movable finger slightly shorter than fixed finger. Walking legs subcylindrical, relatively stout; each dactylus nearly 3/4 as long as propodus, distally curving, ending in strong spine, flexor margin with 8-10 teeth (each with accompanying seta-like spine) diminishing toward base of article, ultimate tooth slightly remote from end of dactylus and much closer to end than to penultimate tooth; propodi and often carpi with plumose setae on dorsal face. First walking legs overreaching distal end of chelipeds. Epipods on chelipeds, absent on walking legs.\n\nDistribution.

The species was later collected between the Azores and the coast of Portugal at 4360 m (A. Milne-Edwards & Bouvier 1894, 1899, 1900), Bay of Biscay, 3992-4510 m (de Saint-Laurent 1985), Iberian coast, 5260-5275 m (Türkay 1975). The present material was collected between the northeast Atlantic (off Ireland, 55º03'N) and southeast Atlantic (off South Africa, 33º23'S), at depths between 2895 and 5330 m. The species has not been found in hydrothermal vents or cold seep areas (Table 2).\n\nGalacantha rostrata A. Milne-Edwards, 1880: 52.

The species was described from specimens collected in Bequia (Lesser Antilles) at 2912 m (A. Milne-Edwards 1880). Munidopsis rostrata has been redescribed and figured in numerous papers, see for instance Khodkina (1975: 263), Baba (1988: 161), Baba & Poore (2002: 239), Baba (2005: 180) and references cited therein. Furthermore, the species has been considered the senior synonym of some species described later, i.e., Galacantha bellis Henderson, 1885 (type locality: off Juan Fernandez, 2516 m), G. talismani Filhol, 1885 (type locality: north of Canary Islands, 2075-2085 m), G. areolata Wood-Mason, 1891(type locality: Bay of Bengal, 2397 m), G. investigatoris Alcock & Anderson, 1894 (type locality: Laccadive Sea, 2200 m). However, the specimens from the different localities show some morphological differences that could indicate the existence of several different species (unpublished data). A revision of the material from different localities is needed to confirm the specific identity of the specimens from different areas.\n\nMunidopsis rostrata is characterized by the carapace surface covered with simple or scale-like tubercles, one prominent median spine on gastric region, 2 prominent spines on anterior lateral margin of carapace, the rostrum bearing lateral spines, with its proximal portion horizontal, distal portion directed strongly upwards, and epipods present on the chelipeds and first two pairs of walking legs.\n\nDistribution. As Baba (2005) pointed out, M. rostrata is a widespread species, known from the western and eastern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western and eastern Pacific, from low to high latitudes (see Baba, 2005 for the list of localities). The species occurs between 1600 and 3294 m. The present material was collected in the northern Atlantic, from off Ireland (57º25.5'N) to the Gulf of Guinea (0º45'N), between 1884 and 3215 m.\n\nGalathea serricornis Loven, 1852: 22.

The species was redescribed and figured by Pequegnat & Pequegnat (1970), Baba (1988Baba ( , 2005) ) and Baba & Poore (2002). Munidopsis serricornis belongs to the group of species bearing a pair of lateral spines at the anterior end of the horizontal portion of the rostrum, the carapace unarmed on the dorsal surface, bearing 4 spines on the lateral margin, the last spine located at the midlength, the abdomen unarmed, the eyespine absent, the mesial margin of cheliped carpus with 2 distal spines, the proximal larger, the walking legs with a row of spines on the dorsal crest, and no epipods on the pereiopods.\n\nDistribution and habitat. Eastern Atlantic from Iceland and Norway to Cape Verde Islands, northwestern Mediterranean; Caribbean Sea in the western Atlantic; Indian Ocean from Somalia to Saya de Malha Bank, and from the Maldives Islands to west of Sumatra; western Pacific from Philippines to Tasmania and Victoria (see Baba 2005). Depth of occurrence between 100 and 2165 m. The OCEANAUT specimens were extracted from a gorgonarian Acanthogorgia sp. (M. Grasshoff, personal communication) which sheltered several other specimens, filmed by the submarine at the moment of collection. This species can derive nourishment from organic particles, or perhaps even the polyps of this gorgonian.\n\nMunidopsis subsquamosa Henderson, 1885: 414.

The specimens collected off Namibia agree quite well with the description and figures of the type material. Our material is also similar to M. subsquamosa aculeata Henderson, 1885(between Marion Island and Crozet islands and off Chile, 2516-2654 m) and M. barnardi Kensley, 1968(W of Cape Point, 2708-2965 m). As Baba (2005) pointed out both taxa are junior names of M. subsquamosa. The specimens collected in the Bay of Biscay and identified provisionally as M. subsquamosa by de Saint-Laurent (1985) correspond to M. exuta (see above). The species is characterized by the carapace having low scale-like ridges on the gastric region, the presence of a group of gastric spines, including 2 epigastric spines, the anterolateral spine of the carapace larger than antennal spine in size, directed anterolaterad, the rostrum spiniform, the abdominal segment 6 with posteromedian margin weakly convex, not produced, the eyestalks short relative to length, the mesial eye-spine present, the cornea relatively small, as broad as the eyespine, the first walking leg overreaching the end of the cheliped, the fixed finger of the cheliped without a denticulate carina on the distolateral margin, the dactyli of walking legs strongly curved distally, the ultimate flexor marginal tooth much closer to the penultimate than to tip of the article, and epipods present on the chelipeds.\n\nDistribution. Japan, eastern Australia, Chile, Marion Island, Crozet Islands, South Africa, between 2516 and 3960 m. The present material was collected off Namibia, between 2840 and 2953 m.

Dorsal carapace surface with some short setae, lateral carapace, abdomen and appendages covered with short fine setae. Carapace with scattered tubercles and faint rugae, more numerous and prominent on branchial regions, without epigastric spines or tubercles. Lateral margin with anterolateral spine directed somewhat anterolaterad, as long as second lateral spine, and followed by posteriorly diminishing spines on anterior branchial region and more laterally expanded posterior branchial region anteriorly bearing distally pointed process followed by smaller process. Rostrum broadly triangular, about 1/ 3 length of remaining carapace. Frontal margin oblique, antennal spine well developed, ZOOTAXA lateral lobes feebly bordered from posteromedian margin. Telson divided into 8 plates, midlateral plates without coarse setae in males. Ocular peduncles hardly movable, basally broad, with strong eye-spine produced distomesially; cornea small and lateral. Third maxilliped merus relatively long, flexor margin with 4 or 5 spines of irregular size, extensor margin bearing distinct distal spine. Chelipeds longer than carapace, merus and carpus with some spines on mesial and distal margins, palm with scattered tubercles and few small mesialspines; fixed finger with denticulate carina on distolateral margin. Walking legs relatively short, granulate; each merus with row of dorsal spines, row of ventral spines on first leg; each propodus with row of dorsal marginal spines, 2 lateral crests with row of tubercles or spines; each dactylus slightly shorter than propodus, terminal claw curving, flexor margin nearly straight; flexor margin with 10-12 teeth (each with accompanying seta-like spine) diminishing toward base of article, ultimate tooth slightly remote from end of dactylus and more remote from tip of dactylus than from penultimate process. First walking legs slightly overreaching end of chelipeds. Epipod present on chelipeds, absent from walking legs.\n\nDistribution and habitat. Munidopsis thieli was described from specimens collected off northwestern Spain (approximately 42º27'N) between 5215 and 5330 m (Türkay 1975). The present material agrees quite well with the original description. The present record extends the geographical range of the species further south (off Mauritania). The species is one of the deepest-living representatives of the genus (Baba 2005). The specimens were collected in areas of low faunal diversity, among actiniarians, bivalves, some echinoderms and numerous tunicates. On the Iberic abyssal plain, the density of M. thieli is very low (1 individual/km 2 , Monniot & Segonzac 1985).\n\nMunidopsis truculenta n. sp. (Fig. 13) Material examined. Off Congo, 05º06'S, 11º18 'E, 800-900 m, 18.11.1969: ovig. female holotype, 9.2 mm (MNHN-Ga 4623).\n\nEtymology. From the Latin truculentus, savage, harsh, in reference to the processes on the carapace.\n\nDescription. Carapace quadrangular, dorsal surface sparsely granulose, areas distinct. Gastric region anteriorly elevated from level of rostrum, bearing pair of obtuse, large epigastric processes. Cardiac region with slightly elevated ridge preceded by deep depression; granules of different sizes. Branchial regions with numerous granules, as figured. Frontal margin oblique near rostrum, and transverse lateral to antennal peduncle, without antennal spine. Lateral margins with obtuse processes or lobes separated by welldefined furrows, lobes without spines, with small granules of different sizes. Rostrum relatively wide at base, distally spiniform, nearly horizontal, dorsal surface convex and granulate, length one-third that of remaining carapace. Third thoracic sternite short and wide, width about half that of following sternite.\n\nAbdomen spineless, somites 2 and 3 each with 2 transverse ridges, each anterior ridge elevated; somite 6 with posterolateral lobes distinctly bordered from nearly transverse posteromedian margin. Telson divided into 8 plates, midlateral plates in male with coarse setae on lateral margin, length-width ratio 0.7.\n\nEyes unarmed, small, movable; cornea distal, slightly wider than eyestalk. Basal article of antennule with two spines (distomesial and distodorsal), mesial distal margin somewhat produced, laciniate. Antennal peduncle unarmed, with strong blunt distolateral process on article 3 only.\n\nIschium of third maxilliped more than half as long as merus, extensor margin with distal spine, mesial crest with row of 24 or 25 denticles; merus with 5 flexor marginal spines or acute granules, proximal one larger; extensor margin with spine on distal end; carpus unarmed, propodus relatively slender.\n\nLeft cheliped (right missing) slender, subcylindrical, 3.2 times as long as postorbital carapace length, clearly longer than first walking legs; unarmed, with numerous small granules; fingers slightly shorter than palm. Merus clearly overreaching end of rostrum, 2.5 times longer than carpus, nearly 1.7 times as long as palm.\n\nWalking legs similar, slender, spineless. Some granules on merus and carpus. Meri subequal on first and second legs, shorter on third than on preceding legs. First walking leg overreaching end of carpus of cheliped but barely reaching midlength of palm; merus slightly overreaching end of rostrum; length 3.3 times that of carpus and 1.5 times that of propodus; dactyli curving, very slender and sharp, with smooth margins, length about twothirds of propodus. Epipods absent from all pereopods.\n\nEggs: Diameter, 1.2 mm. Remarks. The spineless and granular carapace, and slender pereopods with smooth dactyli on the flexor margin link M. truculenta to M. polita (Smith, 1883) from the Caribbean Sea and the eastern coast of United States (145-860 m), M. granulata Miyake & Baba, 1967 from Sagami Bay, Japan (110-200 m), and M. palmatus Khodkina, 1973 from the coasts of Chile, Gulf of Panama and Gulf of California, between 660 and 1245 m (Khodkina 1973, Hendrickx 2001, Baba 2005).\n\nThe new species is easily distinguished from M. polita by the following characters: -The dorsal carapace surface is clearly smoother in M. polita than in M. truculenta.\n\n-The rostrum has a dorsal, longitudinal carina in M. polita, this carina is absent in the new species. -The chelipeds and merus of the walking legs have numerous small granules in M. truculenta, whereas these granules are practically absent in M. polita. The new species is distinctive from M. granulata in the following characters: -The dorsal carapace surface is more granulated in M. granulata than in M. truculenta.\n\n-The spines of the antennular peduncle are more developed in M. granulata than in M. truculenta. Furthermore, the antennal peduncle has some distal spines on each article in M. granulata, instead of being unarmed in the new species.\n\n-The ischium and merus of the third maxilliped each bears an extremely strong spine on the distal end of the extensor margin in M. granulata, instead of a small spine as in M. truculenta. -The merus of the walking legs has a row of spines along the dorsal border in M. granulata, whereas these spines are absent in M. truculenta. Munidopsis truculenta is distinguished from M. palmatus by the following characters: -The anterolateral angle of the carapace bears a distinct spine in M. palmatus, whereas this spine is absent in the new species. -The merus of the chelipeds in M. palmatus bears two rows of spines on the mesial margin, which are absent in M. truculenta. Distribution. Only known from the type locality, off Congo, at 800-900 m. Specific habitat data are not available.\n\nAbout 70 species of Munidopsis are known from the Atlantic Ocean, although only a few of the deep areas have been sampled to any great extent: Western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea (Chace 1942, Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1970, 1971, Gore 1983, Williams & Turner 1986, Pequegnat & Williams 1995, Navas et al. 2003), Middle Atlantic Bight (Werner 1982), Eastern Atlantic (Miyake & Baba 1970, Udekem d'Acoz 1999, Tiefenbacher 2001), Mediterranean Sea (Galil & Goren 1994, Froglia et al. 2002). This suggests that additional species will be discovered as explorations continue.\n\nThere are many taxonomic problems in this genus, and although some recent works (e.g., Ahyong & Poore 2004, Baba 2005) have clarified the status of numerous species, a revision of the Atlantic species is desirable. The recent description of new species closely related to M. subsquamosa, e.g., M. exuta, M. geyeri, M. panamae, M. recta (see Pequegnat & Pequegnat 1971, Baba 2005) exemplifies the complexity of the genus. Other closely related species pairs (e.g., M. acutispina-M. penescabra, M. curvirostra-M. acuta) need revision.\n\nThe most abundant species of Munidopsis collected in this study, i.e., M. crassa, M. curvirostra, M. geyeri, M. rostrata, and M. serricornis, are sexually dimorphic, with males smaller than females. Males and females of M. parfaiti reach similarly large sizes. Sexual dimorphism in size has been observed in other galatheids (Baba 1988, 2005, Macpherson 1994), and is attributed to differential growth rate between sexes (Wenner 1982, Creasey et al. 2000). The overall sex ratios for males and females of the species examined are not different from unity (Table 3), in agreement with the results provided by Wenner (1982) for M. bairdii, M. curvirostra and M. rostrata from the Middle Atlantic Bight. In Munidopsis scobina Alcock, 1894, males are more abundant than females (Creasey et al. 2000). most abundant species collected in Regab seep site, show that this species is trophically dependent on the chemosynthetic production at this site (K. Olu, personal communication).\n\nIn situ observations by submersibles or ROV cameras during diving explorations of the Atlantic abyssal plains indicate that the individual Munidopsis are typically isolated and occur at very low densities, e.g., one specimen per km traversed over sediment areas along the axial valley studied during the FARANAUT cruise (M. S., personal observation). On the neovolcanic ridges formed by pillow lavas on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Munidopsis species were very rare. Abundances increased in the vicinity of active hydrothermal sites (about 10-50 m from the site), although abundances decrease again in the center of the hydrothermal activity (i.e., on active chimneys). At the Snake Pit site, specimens of M. exuta were observed near the active site \"Les Ruches\" , along the slopes covered by hydrothermal sediments (Segonzac & Macpherson 2003) and also in the site « Elan », situated 200 m east off \"Les Ruches\", on mussel beds (Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis, Cosel et al., 1994). Other unidentified individuals were observed among aggregations of the vesicomyid clam Calyptogena (Ectenagena) aff. kaikoi at MAR site Logatchev-Anya's Garden (Gebruk et al. 2000), and ALVIN 1997 (Florida Escarpment site, Fig. 14). In the cold-seeps of the eastern Mediterranean, two species were found in very low densities around the active sites (M. acutispina and M. marionis), and are assumed to benefit from local, chemoautotrophic production (Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004). Other galatheid species are known to occur exclusively in hydrothermally active areas [e.g., off Baja California, Munidopsis lentigo Williams & Van Dover, 1983, Bismark Archipelago, Shinkaia crosnieri Baba & Williams, 1998, Galapagos Islands (unidentified species)], and are found in locally higher densities (Williams & Van Dover 1983, Chevaldonné & Olu 1996, Baba & Williams 1998, Chan et al. 2000).\n\nThe number of species collected per station is very low (mostly one species), probably related to their low densities. In several samples, as many as three species were found, indicating that they coexist in the same zone/habitat. The absence of representatives of this genus in collections from some deep-sea cruises confirms the low densities of these species. For instance, the genus was not observed in the deep Norwegian Sea (NORBI Cruise, 2465-3718 m, Dahl et al. 1977), in the Demerara abyssal plain (west equatorial Atlantic Ocean), from the north of the Amazon alluvial cone to the foot of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (DEMERABY Cruise, 4400 to 4800 m, Sibuet et al. 1984), or on the Vema fault (VEMA Cruise, MAR-10°N, 5091-5880 m), which connects with the abyssal plain of Gambia (M. S., personal observation).\n\nInformation on the geographic distribution of Munidopsis in the Atlantic is still limited and incomplete. Figures 15 and 16 show the geographic and bathymetric distributions of Munidopsis included in this study. Most species have broad geographic and bathymetric distributions, and some can be considered as eurybathic species, e.g., M. antonii, M. curvirostra, M. serricornis (see Werner 1982). Some species have a wider depth range at high latitudes than at low latitudes, e.g., M. serricornis can be found shallower than 300 m depth only in Scandinavian waters (Udekem d 'Acoz 1999). This pattern has also been observed in other decapods, e.g., Neolithodes grimaldii (A. Milne Edwards & Bouvier, 1894)  (Macpherson 1988). Some species are exclusively deep-sea inhabitants, occurring at depths > 2000 m: M. abyssicola, M. aries, M. bairdii, M. crassa, M. exuta, M. geyeri, M. hirtella, M. livida, M. parfaiti, M. subsquamosa, and M. thieli. There is not a clear relationship between depth and geographical (latitudinal or longitudinal) ranges, as has been observed in other marine taxa (Macpherson 2003). This lack of relationship could be a result of the limited knowledge of the distribution of these deep-sea species, and the existence of some doubts in the identity of species collected in different oceans, e.g., M. rostrata, M. subsquamosa, M. serricornis (Ahyong & Poore 2004, Baba 2005, unpublished data). Several species have an amphi-Atlantic distribution (Miyake & Baba 1970), as has been shown for a number of deep-sea decapod taxa, such as nematocarcinid (Crosnier & Forest 1973), bathypalaemonellid (Crosnier & Forest 1973, Cleva 2001), glyphocrangonid (Holthuis 1971), crangonid (Gore 1985, d'Udekem d'Acoz 1999), and alvinocaridid (Komai & Segonzac 2005) shrimps, and parapagurid hermit crabs (Lemaitre 1989). The broad geographic distribution of these species is still difficult to explain satisfactorily, and additional studies on molecular data and larval dispersal processes are desirable.\n\nThe number of species of Munidopsis occurring in the Atlantic (around 70) is higher than in other oceans, probably related to a greater sampling effort in the Atlantic.
