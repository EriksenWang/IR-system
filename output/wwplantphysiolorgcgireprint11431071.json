    "abstract": "A cDNA clone (Banl7), encoding a protein homologous to pectate lyase, has been isolated from a cDNA library from climacteric banana fruit by means of differential screening. Northern analysis showed that Banl7 mRNA is first detected in early climacteric fruit, reaches a steady-state maximum at the climacteric peak, and declines thereafter in overripe fruit. Accumulation of the Banl7 transcript can be induced in green banana fruit by exogenous application of ethylene. This demonstrates that expression of this gene is under hormonal control, its induction being regulated by the rapid increase in ethylene production at the onset of ripening. The deduced amino acid sequence derived from the Banl7 cDNA shares significant identity with pectate lyases from pollen and plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus Erwinia. Similarity to bacterial pectate lyases that were proven to break down the pectic substances of the plant cell wall suggest that Banl7 might play a role in the loss of mesocarp firmness during fruit ripening.",
    "full_text": "Many physiological and biochemical changes accompany the initiation of fruit ripening. In climacteric fruit, in addition to alterations in pigment biosynthesis and the production of flavor compounds, a major increase in the synthesis of ethylene and an increase in respiration also occur. Ripening is also accompanied by a solubilization of the cell wall, which leads to fruit softening. Changes in texture during ripening are one of the major quality traits that determine fruit shelf life. Although these textural changes occur gradually in many fruits, in others, such as banana and strawberry, they take place very rapidly and often dictate the very short postharvest periods characteristic of these fruits. Tissue softening is also associated with an enhancement in pathogen susceptibility and frequently results in funga1 growth at the later stages of ripening.\n\nFruit softening appears to be mainly associated with changes in the pectin fraction of the cell wall (Huber, 1983). Textura1 changes are accompanied by the cleavage of methyl ester groups from the pectin backbone (Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993), a large increase in pectin solubilization, and a reduction in pectin chain length (Seymour et al., 1987;DellaPenna et al., 1990;Smith et al., 1990). There is also a considerable loss of neutra1 sugar residues from the pectic fractions of the cell wall (Gross and Wallner, 1979).\n\nThese ultrastructural and chemical changes are temporarily correlated with de novo synthesis of severa1 cell wall hydrolases, mainly PG and PME (Tucker and Grierson, 1987;Fischer and Bennett, 1991). While PME acts to remove the methyl group from the C-6 position of the galacturonic acid residues that make up the pectin backbone, PG hydrolyzes the a(1-4) link betweeil adjacent demethylated galacturonic acid residues. These two enzymes thereby act synergistically, with PME generating sites for PG action (Pressey and Avants, 1982;Koch and Nevins, 1989).\n\nIt has often been suggested that PG is primarily responsible for pectin degradation and fruit softening (Hobson, 1965;Themmen, et al., 1982;Brady et al., 1983). However, PG-mediated pectin degradation alone cannot account for the significant changes in fruit texture that accompany ripening. In transgenic tomato plants antisense inhibition of PG activity to as little as 0.5% of wild-type levels does not prevent fruit softening (5mith et a]., 1990;Schuch et al., 1991). Conversely, expression of a PG transgene in the tomato ripening mutant rin results in pectin solubilization and depolymerization at near wild-type levels, but fruit softening still fails to take place (Giovannoni et al., 1989;DellaPenna et al., 1990).\n\nSimilar results were obtained in tomato fruit in which PME was down-regulated using antisense RNA technology (Tieman et al., 1992;Hall et al., 1993). These results indicate that in addition to PG and PME, other hydrolytic enzymes are likely to be involved in the textural changes associated with ripening.\n\nIn the present study we report on the structure and fruit-specific expression of a banana cDNA clone with homology to pectate lyase. By differential screening from a cDNA library of ripe banana fruit, the cDNA clone BanI7 was isolated and shown to be specifically expressed in ripe fruit. BanI7 shows significant protein-sequence similarity to the pectate lyases of style and pollen of various plant species (Wing et al., 1989;Budelier et al., 1990;Rafnar et al., 1991) and to extracellular pectate lyases of plant pathogenic\n\nGreen banana fruits (Musa acuminata cv Dwarf Cavendish) were obtained from Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). Fruits were removed from the bunch, treated with fungicide solution (O.l'Xo benlate, 0.3% dithane, w/v), and placed in ventilated jars at 22°C. The various ripening stages were selected by measuring the production of CO, and the ethylene evolution of single fruits. Stage E1 fruits are green fruits, before the increase of ethylene. Stage E2 fruits are early climacteric fruits at the initiation of the ethylene peak. Stage E3 fruits are climacteric fruits at the respiratory peak; at this stage ethylene has started to decrease and the fruit begins to turn yellow. Stage E4 fruits are ripe, yellow fruits.\n\nFor ethylene induction, green fruits were placed in 2-L jars and flushed with a stream of water-saturated air in which C,H, was added to a final concentration of 100 parts per million. Fruits were kept under this ethylene atmosphere for 24 h at 22OC. Control fruits were treated with water-saturated air for 24 h at 22°C.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from fruits following a protocol based on the method described by Varadarajan and Prakash (1991). Crude RNA preparations were purified through a Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) column to remove polysaccharide contaminants. One gram of frozen pulp tissue was ground to powder in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in 10 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCI, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and incubated for 15 min at 65°C. To this homogenate 3.3 mL of 5 M potassium acetate was added, and the mixture was incubated at -20°C for 10 min. Cellular debris were then removed by 50 min of centrifugation at lO,OOOg, and the RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by adding 0.7 volume of cold isopropanol. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at -2O\"C, and the RNA was recovered by centrifugation at 10,OOOg. The precipitate was resuspended in a small volume of Tris-EDTA buffer and purified through a Qiagen column following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nRNA (15 pg of total RNA per lane) was fractionated on a 1.5% agarose / formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred to Hybond (Amersham) blotting membranes (Ausubel et al., 1992). The DNA probes were radiolabeled using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization conditions were as described by Amasino (1986). Filters were washed three times for 30 min each with 3x SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C. Equal loading on the gel was assessed by including ethidium bromide in the loading buffer. Complete transfer to membrane was verified by UV examination of the membrane after blotting. Poly(A+) RNA was purified using an mRNA isolation system (PolyATract, Promega), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\nA cDNA library (0.8 X 106 primary transformants) was constructed from ripe banana pulp poly(A+) RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (A-ZAP, Stratagene). Standard methods described by the manufacturer were used for cDNA synthesis and cloning.\n\nRipe-specific cDNA clones were isolated by differential plaque hybridization using radiolabeled, single-stranded cDNA probes prepared from poly(A') RNAs isolated from unripe and ripe banana fruits, respectively. Plaques hybridizing preferentially to the ripe probe were purified to homogeneity, and the corresponding pBluescript plasmids were in vivo-excised as described in the kit manual.\n\nGenomic DNA was prepared from nuclei isolated from leaves as described by Prat et al. (1989). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 10008 for 5 min, DNA was extracted and purified through a gradient of CsCl that contained 1% sarcosyl. Total DNA (10 pg) was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, separated by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, denatured, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization and washing conditions were as for northern analysis.\n\nSequence analysis was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the T3 and T7 primers of the pBluescript polylinker and specific primers within the cDNA insert. An automated laser-fluorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia) was used to generate the sequence data. Sequence processing and database searches were carried out using the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) programs.\n\nTo isolate genes that showed an elevated expression during fruit ripening, a cDNA library was established from poly(A+) RNA extracted from ripe banana fruit. Using differential hybridization to cDNA probes from green and ripe fruit, severa1 clones were identified that showed a higher signal with the ripe probe. One of these clones, designated BanI7, which corresponds to an mRNA that is differentially expressed and very abundant in ripe banana fruit, was chosen for further characterization.\n\nTo determine the pattern of accumulation of the BanI7 transcript during fruit development, an RNA gel blot was prepared from RNAs isolated from banana fruits at different developmental stages and hybridized with the BanI7 probe. Northern analysis revealed an mRNA of 1.5 kb, indicating that the original clone corresponded to a nearly full-length copy of the transcript. Figure 1 shows that the levels of BanI7 mRNA increase dramatically at the onset of ripening. Maximal levels of the transcript are detected at the respiratory climacteric peak, when the fruit begins to turn yellow (Fig. 1, lane E3). BanI7 mRNA levels declined in the postclimacteric peak (yellow fruit; Fig. 1, lane E4),\n\nBan\\7 mRNA expression during banana fruit ripening. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA isolated from banana pulp at four stages of ripening was loaded in each lane. Lane E1, Green or preclimacteric fruit; lane E2, early climacteric; lane E3, maximum of respiratory climacteric; lane E4, postclimacteric or ripe fruit. The ripening stage of the fruit was assesed by monitoring the rate of ethylene and CO 2 production. The filter was probed with the Ban\\7 cDNA fragment (A) and subsequently hybridized with the Ban4 cDNA probe (B) that corresponds to an extensin or Pro-rich protein transcript constitutively expressed in the fruit. Blots were exposed for 12 h and identical specific activities were used in both hybridizations.\n\nwith a weak signal visible in RNA from overripe fruit (data not shown). No signal was observed in RNA from green or early climacteric fruit (Fig. 1, lanes El and E2, respectively). After a longer film exposure BanI7 mRNA could be detected at the E2 stage of ripening, but still no signal was observed in green fruit, even after prolonged exposures. Likewise, no detectable expression of Banl7 mRNA was found in leaves (data not shown).\n\nThe extensin clone Ban4, which has constitutive levels of expression in banana fruit (E. Dominguez-Puigjaner, unpublished data), was used to estimate the relative amounts of RNA per lane (Fig. IB).\n\nThe complete nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of clone Ba«I7 are shown in Figure 2. The cDNA insert is 1462 bp long and encodes a protein of 398 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 44 kD. The initial Met is missing from the cDNA insert, and by comparison with the predicted amino acid sequence of related proteins it is concluded that a few nucleotides from the transcript are lacking. Subsequent screening of the cDNA library using a radiolabeled 5' fragment from the Banl? cDNA, however, led to the isolation of clones of the same length or shorter than the original cDNA. Similarly, when rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was used to amplify the 5' region of the transcript, only partial cDNA sequences were obtained, which were the same length as those present in the Ban\\7 clone. These results suggest that some sort of secondary structure is formed at the 5' RNA leader, which hinders this region from being copied by the reverse-transcriptase enzyme.\n\nThe BanI7 polypeptide includes a highly hydrophobic region at the amino terminus that has the characteristics of a signal peptide for cotranslational translocation into the ER. A putative cleavage site for a signal peptidase (von Heijne, 1986) is located between Ala-17 and Ala-18. A potential N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) is present in the mature protein (Fig. 2).\n\nComparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for Banl7 with sequences in the EMBL database revealed significant homology to a putative pectate lyase from stylar transmitting tissue from tomato (Budelier et al., 1990) and to pectate lyase homologs from maize, tobacco, tomato, and ragweed pollen (Wing et al., 1989;Rafnar et al., 1991;Rogers et al., 1992;Turcich et al., 1993). At the amino acid level Banl7 shows 74.8% identity to the tomato stylar pectate lyase and 59.7%, 55.2%, 53.4%, and 46.5% identity to 1 OlfcOCCTTCACTOCCCCCATCTACTCTTCTCOTOCACCCTTAACaTCOOCAOCTOTCCOC 1AAFTAPIYSSRAPLTBAAVR 20 MSTL FFTFSLLLL.APLLVI S B I Q 23 61 GACCCTOAATTAGTAQTACAOOAAOTACAAAaAACJCTTGAACGTOTCOCGGCOOCaACTG DPELVVQEVQRSLNV8RRRL 4 0 DPELVVQDVHRSI NASL T R R N L 45 121 OOCTACTTOTCATOCOOCACCQOCAATCCOATCOACOACTOCTGOCOGTOCGACCCTOAC GYLSCQTQNPIDDCWRCDPD 60 GYLSCG6GNPIDRLLAHQPQ 65 181 TGGOCTGACAACCGGCAGCGGCTCGCGGACTGCGCCATCGGGTTCGGOAAGAACGCGATT WADNRQRLADCAIOFGKNAI 80 LGKKSPAF8YCAIGFGKNAI 85 241 GGOGCCAOGOACOOCOAGATATACGTOGTOACCOACAOTGOCaACOACOACCCCGTCAAT GGRDGEIYVVTD6GDDDPVN 100 GGKNGRIYVVTDSGNDDPVN 105 301 CCQAAGCCGOOCACGCTCCOaTACGCCGTCATCCAOGAGOAOCCGCTGTOGATCATCTTC PXPGTLRYAVIQEEPLHIIF 120 PKPGTLRHAVIQDEPLHI I P 1 3 5 361 AAGCGCGACATTOTCATCCAGCTOAAGGAGGAGCTCATCATGAACTCCCACAAOACCATC KRDIVIQLKEELIHN6HKTI 140 KRDMVIQLKQELVMNSYKTI 14S 421 GACGOCCGOOGCOCCAGCGTCCACATCTCCGOCOOOCCGTGCATCACCATCCAGTACOTC DGRGASVBISGQPCITIQYV 160 DGRGASVBISGGPCITIHflT 165 481 ACCAACATCATCATCCACaacOTCCACATCCACaACTOCAAaCAGOGCOOGAACOCOTAC T N I I I H O V B IHDCKgGGNAY 1 8 0 BNIIIBOINIHDCKQSGNON 185 S41 3TGCGCOACTCCCCAOGOCACTACOOOTOOCGCACGOTGTCGGACOGCGACGGOGTGTCC IRD8PNHSGWWDVSDGDGI S 205 601 ATCTTCO^GOGCAfKCACCGTCTTGOOTCQACCACTOCACGCTOTTCAACTOCCACflAC I FOGQPP8WVDBCTLFNCBD 220 IFGGK-NIMVDBC8LSNCBD 224 661 GOGCTCATTGACGCAATTCATGOGTCCACCGCGATCACCATTTCCAACAACTACTTGAQO GLIDAIHGSTAITISNNYLR 240 GLIDAIBG6TAITISNNYFT 244 721 CACCATGACAAGOTCATGCTGCTOGQTCACAOCOACOAGTTOACGTCCGACAAOAGCATO HHDKVMLLGHSDELTSDK6H 2£0 HHDKVML LOBSDSFTQDKGH 264 781 CAOGTCACCATAGCCTTCAACCXCTTCOOGGAXGACCTOOTTCAOAOOATOCCAAOOTGT QVTIAFNBFGEDLVQRHPRC 280 QVTVAFNBFGEGLVQHHPRC 284 841 CGGCATGGCTATTTCCACGTGGTGAACAATGACTACACCCACTGGGAGATOTACGCAATT RBGYFBVVNNDTTBHEMYAI 300 RHGYFBVVNNDYTBHEMYAI 304 901 GGTOOOAOTGCTOCTCCCACTATAAACAOCCAAGOCAACAGATTTCTTOCOCCCAATOAT GGSAAPT IN8QGNRFLAPND 320 GG6AAPTINEQGNRFLAPNE 324 961 COOTTTOCAAAAOAGOTGACTAAACOCaAOOACaCACAaOAGAOCGAaTQOAAGAAGTOO RFAKEVTKREDAQESEHKKH 340 KYRKEVTKBEDAPESQNRSW 344 1021 AACTOOAGOTCOGAAGOOOACCAGATGCTOAATOOAGCCTTCTTCACOCCOTCCCWGGCC NHRSEGDQHLNGAFFTPBGA 360 NMRSEGDLMLNGAYFRQTGA 364 1081 OOAOCTTCOTCtJAGTCACOCGAAGGCGTCOAGCTTOGOGCCCAOGTCGTCGTCTCTCaTC GASBBEAKAS8LGPRSSSLV 380 O A S 8 B8TT A R A 8 6 L B A R P S 8 L V 386 1141 CKWACCATCACCGTCTCTGCCGGCGTTCTCTCGTOCAAGAAOOGATCCCGCTGTTOAACC GTITV5AGVLSCKKG8RC' 400 08ITTNA8PVNCKKG8RC* 406 1201 TCGACCACCACAAOCAOCTCAAAOCGATGCOGATATATATATCTATATATATTTATTGTG 1261 TTATCGTTCXrTCATTTCTCTTCTTTCACCTACTOCATOGTTAOCCATTACOATACCAACC 1321 TCTOCCTGTTAATCTOTOAACCACTTOOOTTCAAAGTOOAAAACCCCATCTOOTTTCAOA 1381 GQCAGCCTOTOCAOATGTQlTOATACTACrrOTCTTQOOATTTOTCTAAGAATOCCTATT 1441 CAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 1462 Figure 2.

Two of these regions correspond to the so-called region I and region II of homology described for bacterial pectate lyases (Keen and Tamaki, 1986). Notably, these regions are the only sequences that are conserved among all Envinia spp. pectate lyases, and recently have been postulated to encompass the Ca 2+ -binding site and the putative active site of the enzyme (Henrissat et al., 1995;Yoder and Jurnak, 1995).\n\nBanana genomic DNA was cut with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and Hmdlll and analyzed by Southern blotting. As shown in Figure 4, the Banl7 probe hybridizes to one major DNA fragment and a few minor fragments. This result suggests the presence of a single gene homologous to Banl7 in the banana genome. Also, the more weakly hybridizing fragments visible on Southern analysis indicate the presence of related sequences within the banana genome, which might correspond to pectate lyase homologs expressed in the pollen or the stylar transmitting tissues.\n\nThe onset of ripening in bananas is indicated by a sharp increase in ethylene production, followed within a few hours by a climacteric increase in respiration. Both the ethylene production peak and the respiratory peak occur as */ Ban 17 Figure 5. Effect of ethylene on Ban\\7 expression in green fruit. Green banana fruits were treated with 100 parts per million ethylene in water-saturated air for 24 h (ethylene). Fruits were subjected in parallel to water-saturated air (air) as a control. RNAs were prepared from samples taken before (control) and after (air, ethylene) the treatments, and subjected to northern analysis. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was loaded per lane and hybridized with the Ban\\7 cDNA insert. RNA from climacteric fruit (E3) was included for comparison.\n\nhighly coordinated and reproducible parameters during ripening (Dominguez-Puigjaner et al., 1992), and were used to developmentally stage the fruit selected for RNA isolation (see \"Materials and Methods\"). This allowed us to evaluate the accumulation of Banl7 mRNA in relation to ethylene production. Banl7 mRNA is hardly detectable in early climacteric (E2) fruit, when ethylene synthesis has just started (see Fig. 1). Levels of Banl7 mRNA, however, become maximal at the climacteric stage of ripening, when ethylene synthesis begins to decrease, respiration peaks, and the fruit starts to turn yellow. Therefore, the timing of Banl7 mRNA accumulation follows the initiation of ethylene synthesis, which suggests that expression of this gene is regulated by ethylene.\n\nTo further assess the potential regulation by ethylene, green banana fruits were treated with 100 ju,L L\" 1 ethylene for 24 h, and RNA was prepared from control and treated fruits and analyzed for Banl7 gene expression. Figure 5 shows that Banl7 mRNA accumulates in green fruits treated with ethylene but not in air-treated control fruits, which indicates that the accumulation of Banl7 mRNA is regulated by ethylene.\n\nPectate lyase, like PG, catalyzes the cleavage of a(l-4) galacturonan linkages, but does so by a /3-elimination rather than by a hydrolytic reaction mechanism. Pectate lyases are secreted by several plant pathogenic bacteria (Collmer and Keen, 1986;Kotoujansky, 1987) and, recently, multiple pectate lyase-homologs have been reported to be expressed in the stylar transmitting tissue from tomato (Budelier et al., 1990) and in the pollen grains of several plants (Wing et al., 1989;Rafnar et al., 1991;Rogers et al., 1992;Turcich et al., 1993). Here we describe the cloning and primary structure of Banl7, a banana ripening-specific transcript encoding a putative pectate lyase. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a pectate lyase-related transcript in fruit.\n\nThe protein Banl7 shares significant amino acid sequence identity (55 and 75% identity, respectively) to pectate lyases from pollen and stylar transmitting tissue. Homology to bacterial pectate lyases is substantially lower (23.3% identity to E. chrysanthemi pelE), but three main regions of homology are detected when the Banl7 protein is aligned with the pectate lyases from Erwinia spp. (Fig. 3). Two of these regions correspond to the regions I and II described for bacterial pectate lyases (Keen and Tamaki, 1986), which were reported to be characteristic for pectate lyase activity.\n\nThe three-dimensional structures of the pectate lyases pelC and pelE of £. chrysanthemi have been recently reported (Lietzke et al., 1994;Yoder and Jurnak, 1995). These proteins fold in an unusual structural motif called a parallel /3-helix, and detailed structural information is available on them. Ca +2 is essential for their in vitro pectate lyase activity, though its exact role in catalysis is not yet determined. Three Asp residues participate in Ca +2 coordination in bacterial pectate lyases, which are found conserved in the Ban\\7 protein ; see Fig. 3). Surrounding the Ca 2+ site, two invariant Arg residues (Arg-276 and Arg-281) and a Pro residue (Pro-278), thought to make up the pectate-binding site, are also conserved in Banl7. Homology to bacterial pectate lyases also extends to the Asn ladder, which is involved in the stabilization of the parallel /3-strands and to the highly conserved vWiDH cluster (for review, see Henrissat et al. [1995]). These structural motifs are shared by pectate lyases from pollen (Wing et al., 1989;Rogers et al., 1992) and style (Budelier et al., 1990.), which suggests that all of these proteins may fold in a parallel j3-helix structure and have a Ca 2+ -dependent pectinolytic activity similar to that of bacterial pectate lyases. In fact, a polygalacturonic acid-degrading activity was recently demonstrated for the cedar pollen Cry/ / protein (Taniguchi et al., 1995).\n\nIn banana, as in other climacteric fruits, the onset of ripening is marked by a large increase in ethylene production. This increase in ethylene appears to play a pivotal role in ripening by triggering the expression of several ripening-specific genes involved in many of the subsequent changes associated with the ripening process (Yang, 1985). A number of ripening-related mRNAs have been shown to accumulate in response to ethylene (Lincoln et al., 1987;Maunders et al., 1987). Similarly, we have shown that treatment with this hormone is able to induce the expression of BanU in green banana fruits. Thus, expression of Banl7 appears to be coordinately regulated, together with other ripening-specific genes, by the climacteric increase of ethylene at the onset of ripening.\n\nBanU mRNA, on the other hand, reaches its maximum levels of expression at the respiratory climacteric peak, when changes in texture begin to take place. This pattern of mRNA accumulation is similar to that observed for PG (DellaPenna et al., 1986) and suggests a role for the Banl7 protein in cell-wall degradation during fruit softening. The evidence for a signal peptide and a potential glycosylation site in the predicted Ban\\7 protein indicates that it may enter the secretory pathway and become a part of the extracellular matrix. Experiments to assess the physiological function of Banl7 in transgenic plants with altered levels of expression of the transcript are under way.\n\nwww.plant.org on October 27, 2014 -Published by www.plantphysiol.org Downloaded fromCopyright © 1997 American Society of Plant Biologists.
