    "abstract": "We isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the DNA binding protein GT-1. This protein factor, which contains 406 amino acids, is highly homologous to the previously described tobacco DNA binding protein GT-lalB2F but is 26 amino acids longer. Recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1, which was obtained from in vitro translation, bound to probes consisting of four copies of pea small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase rbcS-3A box II and required the same GGTTAA core binding site as the binding activity of an Arabidopsis nuclear protein preparation. However, unlike the truncated tobacco GT-la prepared from Escherichia coli extracts, the full-length Arabidopsis GT-1 bound to pea rbcS-3A box 111 and Arabidopsis chlorophyll alb binding protein CAB2 light-responsive elements, both of which contain GATA motifs. Deletion and mutational analyses suggested that the predicted trihelix region of GT-1 is essential for DNA binding. Moreover, GT-1 binds to target DNA as a dimer, and its C-terminal region contains a putative dimerization domain that enhances the binding activity. Transient expression of the GT-l:$-glucuronidase fusion protein in onion cells revealed the presence of a nuclear localization signal(s) within the first 215 amino acids of GT-1.",
    "full_text": "Studies on the function of plant promoters have demonstrated the presence of regulatory cis-acting elements that mediate developmental or environmental signals. Analyses of many light-responsive genes, such as the small subunit of ribulose-1 ,Bbisphosphate carboxylaseloxygenase (rbcS) and the chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB), showed that cis-acting elements responsible for light regulation are located within the 5' upstream region (Gilmartin et al., 1990). Light-responsive expression of the pearbcS-3A gene in transgenic tobacco has been used as a model system to define a complex array of cis-acting elements that interact with a number of different trans factors (Kuhlemeier et al., 1987(Kuhlemeier et al., , 1988;;Gilmartin et al., 1990). The nuclear GT-1 activity that binds to six binding sites in the upstream region of rbcS-3A was identified as one such factor (Green et al., 1987(Green et al., , 1988)). GT-1 binding sites were also found within the promoter regions of several other light-responsive genes and were shown to be involved in light-responsive transcription in vivo (Stockhaus et al., 1987;Manzara and Gruissem, 1988;Dean et al., 1989;Schindler and Cashmore, 1990). Gain-of-function experiments have confirmed the critical role of GT-1 binding sites in mediating light-responsive and tissue-specific gene expression.

The relationship between GT-la/ B2F and nuclear GT-1 was demonstrated by the similar 6-bp core DNA binding sequence requirement and immunological relationship. Notwithstanding, the recombinant GT-la did not bind to a nuclear GT-1 binding site, rbcS-3A box 111. In addition to this discrepancy, several important issues surrounding the properties of GT-la remained unresolved. For example, the DNA binding domain of GT-la was not defined, and it is not known whether GT-la binds to target DNA as a monomer or a dimer. However, it was not possible to carry out detailed DNA binding experiments because of the difficulty in expressing recombinant GT-la in either Escherichia coli or a reticulocyte lysate system in vitro. Our inability to express tobacco GT-la in E. coli prompted us to clone GT-1 from another plant species with the hope of alleviating the apparent toxicity problem. We chose to use Arabidopsis because of the presence of GT-1 binding sites within the promoter sequence of several light-responsive genes of this model plant (Donald and Cashmore, 1990;Koncz et al., 1990;K. Hiratsuka and N.-H. Chua, unpublished data). Furthermore, recent advances in Arabidopsis genetic research may enable us to use lightresponsive mutants in relation to GT-1 function. As a first step toward understanding the mode of interaction of GT-1 in Arabidopsis, we conducted a series of experiments to define the functional domains of the GT-1 protein. In this study, we describe the cDNA cloning, expression, and characterization of Arabidopsis GT-1.\n\nWe screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library constructed in,h ZAPll with a DNA fragment derived from the tobacco GT-la Tobacco GT-ldB2F\n\n1 381-1 8b% Arabidopsis GT-1 1 406 riheiix 41%\n\nArabidopsis GT-2 8\"\" 81% Rice GT-2 I 81% I I proiine / glutamine-rich region ' $$$: acidic region Figure 2. Predicted Structure of Arabidopsis GT-1 and Comparison of GT Box Binding Proteins.\n\nPutative trihelices of tobacco GT-lalB2F (amino acids 75 to 138;Gilmartin et al., 1992), Arabidopsis GT-1 (amino acids 87 to 150; this study), Arabidopsis GT-2 (amino acids 81 to 161 and amino acids 437 to 512; Kuhn et al., 1993), and rice GT-2 (amino acids 98 to 175 and amino acids 489 to 564; Dehesh et al., 1992) are indicated. The degree of homology between the trihelices is shown. Proline-and glutaminerich regions and acidic regions are represented by diagonal striped and stippled boxes, respectively. sequence (Gilmartin et al., 1992) under low-stringency hybridization conditions. Severa1 positively hybridizing cDNA clones were isolated and shown to encode identical sequences. The longest 1.6-kb insert was excised from h ZAPII, propagated in the plasmid pBluescript II SK+, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Figure 1 shows that the lonbest open reading frame encodes a protein of 406 amino acids, which is highly homologous to, but 26 amino acids longer than, tobacco GTla. The predicted secondary structure suggested the presence of a putative trihelix motif contained within the region from Trp-87 to Lys-150. This region showed the highest homology not only to the tobacco GT-la/B2F putative trihelix region (Gilmartin et al., 1992;Perisic and'lam, 1992), but also to the putative trihelices of GT-2 from Arabidopsis (Kuhn et al., 1993) and rice (Dehesh et al., 1992) (Figure 2).\n\nPrevious studies on tobacco GT-la demonstrated the presente of more than one GT-lalB2F-related sequence in the tobacco genome. We therefore investigated the complexity of the GT-1 gene family in the Arabidopsis genome by DNA gel blot analysis. Figure 3 shows that digestion of Arabidopsis genomic DNA with four restriction enzymes resulted in a single hybridization band under standard conditions, suggesting that GT-1 is encoded by a single-copy gene.\n\nRNA gel blot analysis showed that the GT-1 mRNA expression level was unaffected by light and displayed no tissue specificity (data not shown). Similar results were obtained previously with the tobacco GT-1a/B2F expression pattern (Gilmartin et al., 1992;Perisic and Lam, 1992).\n\nTo study the DMA binding properties of recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1, gel shift assays were performed with the full-length protein expressed via a T7 promoter in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Figure 4 shows that recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1 binds to a probe consisting of four copies of pea rbcS-3A box II with high affinity (Green et al., 1988). Moreover, it showed the same requirement for the GGTTAA core sequence as the Arabidopsis nuclear GT-1 activity, although the binding affinity for each box II mutant probe was slightly different (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the previous finding that some differences existed between the binding specificity of tobacco nuclear GT-1 and the recombinant tobacco GT-1a (Gilmartin et al., 1992).\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that tobacco nuclear GT-1 can interact with pea rbcS-3A box II and box III (Green et al., 1987) and the rice phytochrome PHYA GT2 box (Kay et al., 1989;Dehesh et al., 1990) although with different affinity. On the other hand, £ coli extracts containing a truncated tobacco GT-1a showed strong binding only to box II, with no detectable binding to box III (Gilmartin et al., 1992). This observation prompted us to investigate the binding activity of the recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1 to various GT-related motifs. Figure 4 shows the results of gel shifts using probes of tetramers of rbcS-3A box III (Sarokin and Chua, 1992) and the rice PHYA GT2 box and GT3 box (Dehesh et al., 1992). The full-length B E H P Arabidopsis DNA (1 ng) digested with BamHI, EcoRI, Hindlll, andPstl was electrophoresed in lanes B, E, H, and R respectively, and probed with a radiolabeled Bglll-and EcoRI-digested Arabidopsis GT-1 cDNA fragment.

Either 0.5 ng (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15) or 2.5 ng (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16) of the box II competitor was added to the incubation mixtures. Lanes 1,5,9, and 13 contain the probe alone. The free probe (F), nonspecific complex (NS), and bound complex (B) are indicated. Two different binding complexes, a faster and a slower migrating band, observed in Figure 4, are due to the presence of multiple binding sites in each tetramer probe. These two bands are not seen in Figure 4, lanes 2 to 4, because of an overexposure of the autoradiogram. With short exposure times, however, two complexes similar to those in Figure SB were obtained.\n\nArabidopsis GT-1 protein expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system formed a specific DNA-protein complex with each of these four probes, with the box II probe showing the highest affinity. Whereas the binding affinity of box III was ~50 times lower than that of box II, it was still higher (~5 to 10 times) than those of GT2 box and GT3 box probes, as demonstrated by competition experiments. Nevertheless, similar gel shift patterns of protein-DNA complexes were obtained with all the four probes, suggesting that the mode of interaction of recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1 with box III, GT2 box, and GT3 box is similar to box II. The 78-bp fragment of the Arabidopsis CAB2 promoter region from -111 to -33 was recently shown to confer both circadian-and phytochrome-mediated regulation on the -90 35S promoter (Anderson et al., 1994). Gel shift assays using recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1 protein and the radiolabeled 78-bp fragment showed the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex (Figure 5A). Moreover, competition of box IIDNA binding activity using wild-type and mutant CAB2 promoter sequences demonstrated that the binding activity of recombinant GT-1 is similar to that of CGF-1 (Anderson et al., 1994), which requires the repeated GATA motif for binding (Figure 5B).\n\nPrevious deletion studies suggested that the N-terminal region of tobacco GT-1a/B2F is needed for DNA binding\n\nB- (Gilmartin et al., 1992). Because only one truncated mutant was used in the previous work, more refined analysis was required to define the region for DMA binding. To this end, we generated mutants of Arabidopsis GT-1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and site-directed mutagenesis. Arabidopsis GT-1 mutants were produced by transcription and translation of the appropriate templates in vitro. The primary structures of the various mutants are presented in schematic forms in Figure 6A. Figure 6B shows that the dN80 mutant of GT-1 can still bind to the box II probe with an affinity equivalent to that of the full-length protein. On the other hand, removal of an additional 10 amino acids from the N terminus totally abolished all DNA binding activity. These data suggest that the region between amino acids 80 and 90, which encodes the putative first helix, is essential for DNA binding.\n\nThe importance of the putative trihelix structure for DNA binding was confirmed by site-specific amino acid mutation designed to disrupt the tertiary structure of each of the helices. Figure 7 shows that binding activity to box II is decreased dramatically by the Gin-89 to Pro mutation in helix 1, whereas a similar mutation within helix 2 (Gin-118 to Pro) and helix 3 (Leu-143 to Pro) abolishes DNA binding activity completely.

To examine this possibility, we used an N-terminal deletion mutant of GT-1, dN80, which retains the trihelix region. This mutant exhibited high DNA binding affinity, but because of its shorter length, it formed a slightly faster migrating complex compared with that of the full-length GT-1. Figure 9A shows that cotranslation of mRNA derived from dN80 and the wildtype GT-1 cDNA in a reticulocyte lysate system leads to the formation of a DNA-protein complex of an intermediate mobility, demonstrating that GT-1 binds as a dimer. However, the intermediate complex was not observed when the two proteins were mixed after translation. Cotranslation of mRNAs derived from the C-terminal deletion mutant dC382 with wild-type GT-1 did not produce any intermediate complex (data not shown). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of GT-1 mediates homodimer formation, which enhances the DNA binding activity.\n\nThe importance of the C-terminal region in mediating GT-1 homodimer formation was further confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Figure 9B shows that full-length GT-1 and dN80 form a homodimer complex that can be cross- (A) SDS-urea-PAGE analysis of site-specific mutants of GT-1 proteins generated by transcription and translation in vitro.

Lane C contains the probe only; lanes 1 to 4 contain translation products 1 to 4 from (A), respectively. The free probe (F) and bound complex (B) are indicated. Surprisingly, a short deletion (24 amino acids) of the C-terminal region of GT-1 decreased the DMA binding activity drastically and resulted in the formation of a complex with higher mobility. However, further C-terminal deletion to amino acid 146, which removes part of helix 3, abolished DNA binding activity completely (Figure 8). Collectively, these observations provided evidence that the trihelix region is essential for DNA binding and that the C-terminal region is required for highaffinity DNA binding.\n\nThe result of C-terminal deletion studies of GT-1 prompted us to investigate the function of this region of the molecule. We speculated that the formation of a complex with higher mobility with C-terminal deletion mutants was due to the removal of a dimerization domain that enhances the DNA binding activity C 1 2 3 4 WT homodimer WT/dNSO heterodimer dN80 homodimer • Free probe B WT dC363 dNSO dN80/dC363 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GA-+ -+ -+ -+ 96*-67*-46*-' 30*-Figure 9.

(B) Glutaraldehyde cross-linking of Arabidopsis GT-1 deletion mutants. linked by glutaraldehyde treatment, whereas dC363 does not. These results also suggest that Arabidopsis GT-1 can form homodimers in solution even in the absence of target DNA.\n\nTo determine the intracellular localization of GT-1, a GT-1 cDNA fragment was fused in-frame to the £. coli GUS coding sequence. Because the N-terminal portion of GT-1 contains a basic domain within the trihelix motif, which may include putative nuclear localization signals, GT-1 cDNA corresponding to Met-1 to Gly-215 was used for this purpose. The fusion gene was cloned into the plant expression vector VIP26 as described previously (van der Krol and Chua, 1991). The GT-1::GUS fusion construct was introduced into onion skin cells by particle gun bombardment, and the fusion protein was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Shieh et al., 1993). The intracellular localization of the GT-1-GUS activity was determined by histochemical staining with X-gluc. Figure 10A shows an example of the histochemical staining of onion monolayer cells bombarded with the GT-1::GL/S construct. Note that the blue precipitate was localized within the nucleus. By contrast, GUS activity was observed mainly in the cytoplasm when the GUS gene alone was used (Figure 10B). These results demonstrate the presence of a nuclear localization signal(s) within the first 215 amino acids of the Arabidopsis GT-1 molecule.\n\nthe twin trihelix motifs of GT-2, the GT1 box (GGTTAAT) of rice PHYA, which shares an identical 6-bp'core sequence to the pea rbcS-3A box II, is bound only weakly by the N-terminal domain of rice GT-2 and not at all by the C-terminal domain (Dehesh et al., 1992). In this study, we detected only a weak binding activity of Arabidopsis GT-1 to rice GT2 and GT3 boxes, suggesting that GT-1 most likely does not interact with such sequences in vivo. We also found that Arabidopsis GT-1 could bind to the pea rbcS-34 box 111 probe, with a binding affinity clearly higher than those of the GT2 and GT3 boxes; however, the affinity was 4 0 times lower as compared with box II. The latter result is consistent with the previous observation that box 111 has a lower transcription activity in vivo (Gilmartin and Chua, 1990). Previous experiments showed that the recombinant tobacco GT-1a did not show any detectable binding to the GT2 box and box 111 (Gilmartin et al., 1992). It is noteworthy that the tobacco GT-1 protein used for these experiments was a C-terminal deletion mutant missing the last 244 amino acids. It is possible that the difference in DNA binding activity between Arabidopsis GT-1 and tobacco GT-la is due to the presence or absence of the C-terminal region that mediates dimerization and, consequently, enhances the DNA binding activity of GT-1.\n\nIn this study, we observed specific binding of recombinant Arabidopsis GT-1 to a light-responsive promoter region from the Arabidopsis CABP gene, which contains GATA motifs. These motifs are likely involved in GT-1 interaction because mutations in these sequences blocked binding (Figure 4). Because GATA boxes are frequently found within the promoter region of light-responsive genes (Grob and Stuber, 1987;Gilmartin et al., 1990), GT-1 may be involved in GATA box-mediated transcriptional regulation as well.\n\nThe fact that Arabidopsis GT-1 shows a clear binding preference for box II and box 111 is important when considering the interaction of GT box binding proteins with DNA. The available evidence indicates that Arabidopsis GT-1 binds preferentially to cis elements of light-inducible genes (e.g., rbcS-%), whereas the GT-2 protein prefers cis elements of genes that are negatively regulated by light (e.g., the GT2 box of rice PHYA).\n\nCotranslation experiments and gel shift assays with fulllength GT-1 and the dN80 mutant indicated the formation of a homodimer. Although the dimerization domain was not localized precisely, a 24-amino acid truncation of the C terminus was enough to abolish high-affinity DNA binding to box 11, resulting in a faster migrating complex. This result suggests that this C-terminal region is essential for dimer formation. Sequence comparison of the C-terminal region of GT-1 with the protein sequence data base showed no significant homology with previously reported proteins. The dimer formation of Arabidopsis GT-1 is consistent with the fact,that two GT-1 binding sites are required for nuclear GT-1 binding in vitro and for light-dependent gene expression in vivo (Green et al., 1988;Gilmartin and Chua, 1990). It is also important because of the possible interaction of GT-1 with other molecules that may contain a compatible dimerization interface. Association of GT-1\n\nOur study was undertaken in an effort to dissect the molecular structure of the Arabidopsis GT-1 protein because only a limited amount of information was obtained from the earlier studies with tobacco GT-lalB2F.\n\nThe amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis GT-1 deduced from its cDNA nucleotide sequence shows a high degree of homology with tobacco GT-lalB2F. Homology is especially high within the putative trihelix region, with an amino acid identity of ~8 6 % . Together with the fact that GT-1 is encoded by a single-copy gene within the Arabidopsis genome, these findings lead us to conclude that the cDNA clone described in this report is an Arabidopsis homolog of tobacco GT-lalB2F. Furthermore, this conclusion is reinforced by the identical DNA binding property of the two proteins with respect to the box II mutant series (data not shown) and the absence of another Arabidopsis gene that is homologous to tobacco GT-la, as confirmed by DNA gel blot analysis. On the other hand, Arabidopsis GT-1 (406 amino acids) is significantly longer than tobacco GT-lalB2F (380 amino acids) and contains an additional histidine-rich region ranging from His-46 to His-57. The function of this domain remains to be investigated.\n\nAs summarized in Figure 2, two previously reported DNA binding proteins, GT-2 from rice and Arabidopsis, exhibit some homology with Arabidopsis GT-1 and tobacco GT-lalB2F. The putative trihelix region of Arabidopsis GT-1 shows homology with each of the Arabidopsis GT-2 trihelices: 38 and 41% for the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain, respectively. In addition to the homology between the DNA binding domains, GT-1 and GT-2 share specific domains, such as the prolinelglutamine-rich and the acidic domains, both of which are presumably involved in the transcriptional regulatory function of the protein. The alignment of these specific amino acid clusters of GT-1 is similar to the C-terminal domain of rice GT-2. These structural similarities suggest a close relationship between two groups of DNA binding proteins.\n\nRNA gel blot analysis of GT-1 transcripts showed no difference in expression level among the samples tested (data not shown), suggesting that GT-1-mediated transcriptional regulation is unlikely to be controlled by the expression level of its mRNA. This result is consistent with the previous observation that box I1 binding activity is present in nuclear extracts prepared from light-grown as well as dark-adapted plants (Green et al., 1987(Green et al., , 1988). An attractive hypothesis is that Arabidopsis GT-1 activity is regulated at the post-translational level, although much more biochemical characterization of the protein, such as reversible phosphorylation and/or protein-protein interaction, will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.\n\nThe GT-2 protein has two separate trihelix DNA binding domains, one at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus, which bind preferentially to the rice PHYA GT3 box (GGTAAAT) and GT2 box (GGTAATT), respectively. Although the DNA binding domain of Arabidopsis GT-1 shows similarity with each of with another molecule may generate new DNA binding specificities, leading to the interaction with different target sequences not recognized by the GT-1 homodimer.\n\nOriginally, GT-1 was identified as a nuclear protein that binds to light-responsive promoters, although no information was available concerning its intracellular localization. Because the GUS fusion protein strategy has been successfully applied to the study of nuclear localization of plant DNA binding proteins (Raikhel, 1992), we tested a GT-1::GUS chimeric construct by transient expression assays. Our results strongly suggest Arabidopsis GT-1 is localized in the nucleus in vivo. Although it is probable that GT-1 contains at least one nuclear localization signal, we could not identify any previously reported nuclear localization signal consensus sequence within the amino acid sequence of GT-1. Further molecular dissection will be necessary to define the amino acid sequence directly involved in nuclear targeting. In addition, because nuclear localization may be a regulatory step of GT-1-mediated transcriptional regulation, studies on the in vivo mechanism of GT-1 intracellular localization will also be interesting.\n\nTaken together, our results provide strong evidence that the Arabidopsis GT-1 described in this report is functionally similar to the nuclear GT-1 that binds to light-responsive elements. The availability of a full-length cDNA clone encoding GT-1 would allow future experiments designed to manipulate the activity of this protein in vivo.\n\nRNA and DNA gel blot analyses as well as other standard molecular cloning techniques were performed as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA sequencing was carried out using a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturet's instructions. DNA and amino acid sequence data were processed using a Macintosh DNASIS (Hitach Software Engineering Co., San Bruno, CA) program software package.\n\nAn Arabidopsis cDNA library in h ZAPll (Stratagene) made from lightgrown Arabidopsis (Columbia) mature plants was screened with tobacco GT-la cDNA. The bacteriophage library was plated at a density of -50,000 plaque-forming units per 150-mm-diameter Petri dish. Plaques were lifted onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (Du Pont) and prehybridized for 2 hr at 37% in 20% formamide, 5 x SSC (1 x SSC is 0.15 M NaCI, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 1% SDS, 5 x Denhardt's solution (1 x Denhardt's solution is 0.020/0 Ficoll, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% BSA), and 50 mglmL denatured salmon sperm DNA. The probe was prepared by random prime labeling of the isolated tobacco GT-la EcoRl insert with the Klenow fragment of,DNA polymerase I. The labeled probe was added to the prehybridization mix and incubated at 37°C for 12 hr. Filters were washed twice in 2 x SSC, lO/o SDS at 6OoC for 30 min and exposed to Kodak XAR films (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY) with intensifying screens.\n\nN-terminal deletions were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: dN30,5'-GGGAAGCTTGCCGCC- ACCATGAlGATCGAmACTCACCACCACT-3'; dN60,5'-GGGAAGCTTGCC-GCCACCATGTCTCAGCCACAACAACAGATT-3'; dN80, 5\"GGGAAG-CTTGCCGCCACCATGGCACCAAAGAAACGAGCGGAG-3'; dN90, 5'-GGGAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGCAAGACGAAACTCGTAGCTTA-3'; and the reverse primer 5LAACAGCTATGACCATG-3'.\n\nC-terminal deletions were generated by exonuclease 111 digestion of the full-length clone and insertion of an Nhel stop codon linker (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). dC146 was constructed by PCR using the primer dC146 (5'-CTAAAACTTAAACTCTTTCAACAGATTC-3') and the M13 -20 primer. Interna1 mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the supplier's instructions.\n\nGel shift studies were performed as described previously (Green et al., 1988;Foster et al., 1992). All plasmid constructs were transcribed with T7 polymerase in vitro using an RNA transcription kit (Stratagene); RNAs were translated with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (Promega) in the presence of 35S-methionine, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein production in each reaction was verified by SDS-PAGE or SDS-urea-PAGE followed by autoradiography.\n\nTransformation of Onion Cells and Histochemical Staining pB1121 was digested with BamHl and Sacl to release the p-glucuronidase (GUS) coding sequence. The BamHI-Sacl fragment was inserted into a pBluescript I1 SK+ vector containing a full-length Arabidopsis GT-1 coding sequence to generate the GT-1::GUS fusion construct. Protein production of the GT-1::GUS construct was first verified by transcription and translation in vitro as previously described. Subsequently, the chimeric coding sequence was introduced into a plant expression vector (van der Krol and Chua, 1991). Onion peel cells were bombarded with 1.6-mm gold particles coated by GT-1::GUS or GUS DNA using a model PDS-1000lHe particle delivery system (Bio-Rad). After incubation at 28OC in the dark for 48 hr, samples were treated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 10 mglmL X-gluc (5bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl-!3-o-glucuronic acid) for 2 to 12 hr at 37OC (Jefferson et al., 1987). lntracellular localization of GUS activity was observed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Instruments, Inc., Pelham, NY) and photographed with a Nikon FX-35Acamera(Nikon Inc., Melville, NY)."
