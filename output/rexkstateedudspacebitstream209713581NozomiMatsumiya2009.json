    "full_text": "One of the important keys to characterize the biological function of a protein is the study of post-translational modification (PTM). Formation of disulfide bond linkages between cysteine residues within a protein is a common PTM which not only contributes to folding and stabilizing the protein structure, but also to accomplishing its native function. Therefore, the study and discovery of structural-functional relationships of expressed proteins using an isolated proteomics approach has been one of the biggest advances within the field of structural biology in recent years. In this study, rapid disulfide bond mapping of freshly obtained equine serum albumin (ESA) was performed using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Highly sensitive MALDI-TOF MS is commonly used for the investigation of disulfide bond linkages in the proteomics field. However, it has also been known that the presence of disulfide bond linkages absorbs the energy which is created by the cysteine-cysteine kinetic vibration, resulting in a decrease of the instrumental sensitivity. To overcome this problem, the disulfide bond mapping method was optimized by applying a combination of chemical labeling, proteolytic enzymes, and matrices. With the optimized method, we were also able to achieve high protein sequence coverage. Obtaining higher sequence coverage of a protein provides more information about a protein which helps to identify the protein by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) technique. These analyses eventually contribute to the estimation of the possible PTM sites.

A variety of PTMs have been discovered and studied, including attachment of phosphates, lipids and sugars. Due to the presence of these additional appended groups, proteins can be altered with respect to stability or activity. As of 2006, at least 350 different types of PTMs had been reported. 1 Due to the extensive progress in PTM research in recent years, the number of distinct PTMs discovered has been increasing. Even though many PTMs have been discovered, characterization of many of them has proven to be a difficult task. Identification and characterization of a PTM can be difficult because such identification is labor-intensive, the database for the genome can be incomplete and there are no standardized methodologies. 1 Various clinical research groups produced protein-based biopharmaceuticals involving a broad range of PTMs, with many of these having at least one, or more likely a combination of two or more PTMs.\n\nGlycosylation is one of the most common PTMs along with carboxylation and hydroxylation. It has been reported that nearly 50 % of human proteins are glycosylated. [2][3] Glycosylation includes the attachment of mono, oligo, and extended polysaccharide chains. Glycosylation is reported to help proteins fold correctly and therefore to be stabilized better with often enhanced solubility. 2 Besides glycosylation, one of the other significant PTMs is formation of disulfide bonds.\n\nThe formation of disulfide bond linkages contributes to the stabilization of the protein's tertiary structure. This makes proteins which have larger numbers of amino acid residues between two bond forming cysteines more stable. The location of cysteines within a protein greatly affects the conformation of natively folded protein. Besides stabilizing the structure of protein, disulfide bonds also influence activation or regulation of potential function of protein by forming correct or incorrect bondings. [3][4][5] In order to form a disulfide bond, two cysteine residues in a protein must be co-oxidized. Cysteine is the only amino acid among 20 major encoded amino acids that contains a reactive sulfur atom. This sulfhydryl group can function in many ways. It generally exists by forming native disulfide bond with other present cysteines in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum to maintain its native bioactivity or stay as free (reduced) cysteine which also functions as a regulator or a substance carrier in many given biological systems. [4][5][6][7][8] In a review article by Mamathambika, 9 four major factors are emphasized; concentration of thiolate anion (-Sˉ), accessibility, proximity, and reactivity of the thiolate anion or bond linkage can all affect formation of disulfide bonds. Also, when the native disulfide bond and a sulfhydryl group of free cysteine come closer, disulfide bond exchange can occur between already formed disulfide bond and a free cysteine as it is shown below.\n\nR1-SH + R2S-SR2 ⇋ R1S-SR2 + R2-SH 10 The equilibrium constant for the disulfide bond exchange can be varied by the stability of each bond. Because sulfhydryl groups usually stay in the reduced form within a cell, new disulfide bond formation is more likely to occur extracellularly where the pH is higher by breaking original bond with possible presence of reducing agent such as glutathione. The pKa of cysteine sulfhydryl group normally is 8.37, therefore reoxidation to form new bond most likely happens at higher pH values. 9 R-SH ⇋ R-S -…H + ⇋ R-S - Under certain condition, pKa value of cysteine can be shifted depending on the surrounding environment within a protein. For example, Keap1 protein, the repressor of Nrf2 which acts in the role of transcriptional activation of phase 2 genes, could have a lower pKa values than usual. Nrf2 is normally bound to the cytoplasm through Keap1 which is anchored to the cytoskeleton. These two form a complex and regulate phase 2 gene transcription. Murine Keap1 is 624 amino acid long protein and contains 25 cysteines in which 4 cysteines are identified to be most reactive. When these 4 cysteines which are located on the binding domain are modified, Nrf2/Keap1 complex is disrupted. This disruption causes Nrf2 to be dissociated from Keap1 and moved to nucleus where it accelerates the transcription. Because these 4 cysteines are located adjacent to the basic residues which have higher side chain pKa values, pKa of cysteines would be lower than usual. It is not uncommon to see the case where cysteine pKa values are shifted due to the change in its surrounding conditions. [11][12] Formation of disulfide bonds is certainly necessary for plants as well. Disulfide bond formation can reversibly be regulated by signaling element which controls gene expression level of chloroplast in many plant's metabolic pathways. 13 It is also known that some protein folding mechanisms first require disulfide isomerase and a formation of non-native disulfide bonding in order to form correct disulfide bonds later. 9, 14 If a protein was not folded correctly, the protein can lose its original function and become aggregated or degraded by proteases. Proteins containing multiple or odd numbers of cysteines are still capable of forming correct disulfide bonds and this fact indicates high specificity of disulfide bond formation. The bovine cathepsin C (CC), a lysosomal cysteine protease, is a tetramer, made of four identical monomers, and contains 13 cysteines per each monomer. Out of 13 cysteines, 10 cysteines were confirmed to be participating in the formation of disulfide bonds while the remaining 3 cysteines were identified to be free. Among those three cysteines, one is classified to be an inaccessible buried residue while another cysteine is a catalytic residue located in the active site. One last free cysteine becomes exposed during the activation process and can cause dissociation of the tetramer into dimers which indicates that this free cysteine significantly contributes to the maintenance of the original structure. 15 Identifying existing disulfide bonds in the protein leads to understanding of functional mechanism of the protein. 16 Disulfide bond formation is necessary for a protein to perform its function.\n\nHowever, determination of the disulfide bond can be challenging due to the presence of unstable intermediates and other technical concerns which discussed later. 9,[16][17]\n\nDetermination of the structure of a protein in its native state gives us many clues to understand the functional properties of the protein. It is often difficult to perform a full structural analysis of a protein at its native state due to larger molecular weights and numerous PTMs. 18 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), X-ray Crystallography, and Edman Degradation have essentially been used to study structural aspects of protein. These methods are used to analyze and identify disulfide bonds.\n\nHowever, these methods can be limited by several factors. Sample concentration is one aspect that limits an analytical method. It will also depend on protein's purity and sensitivity of the instrument. NMR usually requires highly purified sample, greater than 90 % purity, in a milligram scale. Likewise, x-ray crystallography will most likely require equal or higher amounts of purified samples for crystallizations. Purifying samples can be challenging if the sample is not abundant or is difficult to extract. Furthermore, x-ray crystallography uses proximity of neighboring cysteines to estimate disulfide bond linkages rather than actually measuring real disulfide bonds. Also, there is always extra time needed for the data processing steps. After raw experimental data are collected, both NMR and x-ray crystallography require data conversion or processing by computer to actually obtain analytically comparable data. Edman Degradation can be useful if sample is a peptide, generally less than 5000 in molecular weight. The reaction efficiency of each degradation step is relatively high which leads to prevention of sample loss. However, this method still requires a large quantity of chemical reagents and time throughout the experiment. 8,19 Additionally, it can only analyze one pure peptide at a time and sample must have a free N-terminal to initiate degradation reaction.\n\nMass Spectrometry (MS) has been contributing to the wide range of research fields especially in the proteomics research in the past few decades. Recently, it has often been used to obtain a variety of information such as sequencing of protein and investigation of protein's original structural characteristics including the assignment of disulfide bonding. [3][4]8,14,16,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26] MS is highly sensitive, regularly using only pico or femto mol amounts which is much less than that required by the other analytical instruments discussed above. Because amount of sample required for MS analysis is relatively small, it can be processed from either a solution or a gel. MS can analyze sample at the native state since it does not require any crystallization or treatment with organic or inorganic solutions.\n\nElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are the two most commonly used mass spectrometry instruments for the determination of disulfide bonds and identification of related PTMs of a protein. [1][2][3][4][23][24] Another significant point to mention is that by using MS, we can expect relatively high coverage of the protein sequence. High yield protein sequence coverage is an essential key to the characterization of a protein because it provides information across the full length of the sequence. This additional information will lead to the complete assignment of the PTM sites leading to understanding of protein regulation mechanisms. Now, researching biomarkers of different diseases is very much demanded from the society, detection of any kind of sequence modification such as deletion or truncation can give clues to the research goal. 20 Sequence coverage sometimes helps ascertaining the amount of expressed protein as well. Obtaining high yield sequence coverage depends on many small factors for instance, amount of protein, sample preparation and matrix adjustments. 23 Chemical modification followed by enzymatic digestion of a protein is the basic proteomics approach for detecting disulfide bond linkages using MS. 4,14,26 MALDI-TOF MS particularly is useful to detect disulfide bonds because of its high sensitivity and relatively simple methodology. However, it is well known that the sample containing multiple cysteines or disulfide bonds is hard to be detected causing the energy absorbance or kinetic vibration caused by the multiple cysteines. Also any salts or contaminants including non-cysteine-containing digested fragments lead to poor ionization efficiency of the sample. Due to these factors, only 40-50 % is the range of protein sequence coverage by MALDI-TOF MS. When it is combined with CE (capillary electrophoresis)/ESI-TOF MS, sequence coverage can be up to 90 % as it is reported. 20,23 Overall, adjustment of MALDI matrices as well as careful sample preparation would greatly contribute to the collection of reliable data and high yield sequence coverage.\n\nSerum albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood plasma of vertebrates, up to 50 % of all protein. 27 It is generally rich in cysteines and the molecular weight is also relatively large, 67 kDa for human serum albumin. See Figures 1-1and 1-2 for 3D structure and primary sequence. [29][30] Serum albumin is quite hydrophilic and this hydrophilicity contributes to keeping up the oncotic (colloid osmotic) pressure. For example, when a large amount of protein was suddenly lost or body was lacking in enough nutrition, the protein level can suddenly be dropped which causes dramatic decrease in blood pressure levels. This condition accumulates fluids in surrounding tissues which eventually causes our body to get swollen, known as edema. Besides maintaining oncotic pressure, the free cysteine can specifically transport molecules or substances such as ions or variety of drugs to the necessary area. Because of these function, serum albumin is often called \"multifunctional plasma transport protein.\" 27 Equine Serum Albumin (ESA) used in this study, contains 607 residues and 35 cysteines.\n\nSee Figures 1-3 and 1-4 for primary and secondary structure of ESA. 28,31 Furthermore, the ESA sequence is 76.1 % and 73.9 % identical to the human serum albumin 30 and the bovine serum albumin 32 respectively (see Figure 1-5 for comparison). 28 This high sequence similarity also applies to the position and the number of disulfide bonds reported. Both human and bovine serum albumins contain 17 disulfide bonds in similar sequence positions. The three dimensional structure of ESA determined using x-ray crystallography with a resolution of 0.27 nm was studied and positions of 17 disulfide bonds and 1 free cysteine site were predicted. 28 It was also known that ESA contains 3 phosphorylation sites. Being very abundant and a cysteine rich protein, ESA was an excellent candidate for this study.

In order to improve quick and easy disulfide bond mapping methodologies and also to achieve high yield protein sequence coverage using MS, we optimized the protocol by chemically labeling the cysteines and also used a new type of matrix. Nearly 90 % of sequence coverage was obtained by single enzyme digestion after reduction and carboxymethylation of sample while two enzyme combined data showed up to 92 % sequence coverage. The possibility of other PTMs such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, in the ESA sample, were also investigated using a proteomics approach.\n\nKSU ES was diluted 1/5, 1/10, and 1/100 of the original concentration using D.D.water. To the 2.0 μL of diluted sample, 13.0 μL of D.D.water and 5.0 μL of the SDS sample buffer were added to make a total volume of 20.0 μL in each sample. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) standard, 2.0 mg/mL, was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL with D.D.water. Sample buffer 5.0 μL was added to 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μL of diluted BSA standard. D.D.water was added into the BSA mixture to make a total volume of 20.0 μL in each sample mixture. A total 20.0 μL of prepared serum and BSA standards were loaded into the prepared tricine gel. The electrophoresis was performed by following the standard protocol using Invitrogen SDS-PAGE apparatus as described in the previous section. UN-SCAN-IT gel software version 6.1 (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) was used to determine the density of each band after scanning the completed gel using a ScanJet ADF (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The prescribed dilution of the BSA concentration standards were plotted in the x-axis and average pixels of the corresponding bands were plotted in the y-axis to make a standard calibration graph. This standard calibration graph was later used to determine the concentration of equine serum albumin.\n\nThe dye 6-Iodoacetamido fluorescein (6-IAF, molecular weight = 515.26) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Freshly obtained KSU ES (native), 50.0 μL, was mixed with equal volume of 5 mM of 6-IAF stock solution (2.58 mg/mL 50 % DMF in D.D.water.) and placed in 4 °C for an overnight reaction in the dark (more than 10 fold excess 6-IAF to a free cysteine). Unreacted 6-IAF was removed by using a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ) using D.D.water. SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectrophotometer were used to confirm the attachment of 6-IAF to the free cysteine site in the serum. Purified sample was covered and kept in 4 °C.\n\nSDS sample buffer, 10.0 μL, was added to 10.0 μL of the collected 6-IAF labeled serum fractions and then the mixture was applied to the SDS-PAGE using the standard protocol. After running, the gel was first rinsed with D.D.water to wash out the SDS and 6-IAF. It was then visualized using a Typhoon 9410 Imager (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), which was set at 488 nm and 520 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Image Quant TL 7.0 software (GE Healthcare bioscience AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for the image analysis. The sample was prepared for the ingel digestion by following the standard protocol; 6-IAF attached serum albumin band from completed gel was cut into pieces and washed with 50 % acetonitrile twice for 15 minutes each. It was then frozen and dried using FreeZone 2.5Plus lypholizer (LABCONCO, Kansas City, MO).  Proteolytic Digestion Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade (Promega, Madison, WI) 10 ng/μL in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Fluka/Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 30.0 μL, was added to the prepared gel pieces followed by the addition of 30 μL of digestion buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate). The sample was then incubated for overnight at 30 °C. The same procedure was repeated for the digestion using the endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche,   25 The reducing capability of DAN was tested using a synthesized vasopressin by mixing sample and prepared matrix in 1:1 ratio. Vasopressin is a peptide hormone containing 2 cysteines, 1 disulfide bond, and synthesized in the magonocellular cells of brain to be released into the blood stream. Its main function is to regulate the water retention in the body leading to the control of urine levels. 35\n\nGelCode Glycoprotein Staining Kit was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL).\n\nHorseradish Peroxidase (HP) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (TI) (included in the kit) were used for positive and negative controls respectively. Both dried controls were resuspended by adding 0.5 mL of D.D.water to make 2 mg/mL solution. It was then diluted to make a concentration of 1 mg/mL using the SDS sample buffer. 1.0 μL of the equine serum was diluted with 10.0 μL of D.D.water and 22.0 μL of SDS sample buffer to make 1 ug/μL solution. BSA (used in the protein concentration determination experiment) was also diluted with SDS sample buffer to make 1 mg/mL solution. Both 5.0 and 10.0 μL of each control and prepared sample were applied to the tricine gel. The SDS-PAGE standard protocol previously described was used to carry out electrophoresis.\n\nThe completed gel was stained by following the direction briefly described here. The gel was fixed in 50 % methanol, and then washed with 3 % acetic acid. After removing the wash solution, the oxidizing solution (include in the kit) was added to the gel and gently agitated for 15 minutes. To the gel, 3 % acetic acid was added again to gently wash the gel for a few times. The glycoprotein staining reagent (included in the kit) was added which react only with the glycoproteins. After discarding the staining solution, a reducing solution (include in the kit) was added. Finally, the gel was washed with 3 % acetic acid and D.D.water then scanned using Epson TWAIN5 USB Scanner.\n\nThe Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain Kit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The same tricine gel which was used for the glycoprotein investigation was again used for this experiment. The completed gel was stained by following the direction briefly described here. The gel was fixed with the fixing solution; 50 % methanol/ 3 % acetic acid followed by rinsing with D.D.water.\n\nThen Pro-Q Diamond stain was added to the gel followed by 1 hour incubation in dark.\n\nDestaining solution was prepared by mixing 20 % acetonitrile and 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 4. The stained gel was transferred into the destaining solution for three times to remove the background, and then the gel was once again washed with D.D.water for twice. The stained gel was visualized using Typhoon 9410 with 532 nm excitation wavelength and 560 nm long pass emission wavelength. Image Quant TL 7.0 software was used for further image analysis.\n\nThe KSU and Sigma ES showed identical bands based on the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 3\n\nThe protein concentration determination standard calibration graph (Figures 3-3 for the gel image, 3-4 for the data table, and 3-5 for the graph) was made by taking μg of standard BSA along the x-axis and average number of pixel on y-axis.

The IAA-labeled free cysteine fragment (residues 45-65), [M+H] + = 2478.2 m/z, was detected. Peptide clusters Tryp 1 (1 miscleavage), 4, 5, 7, and 8 from the Table 3-1 were also detected with smaller intensities. The total sequence coverage of this spectrum was calculated to be 47.0 % as indicated in blue in the Figure 3-14.

The 6-IAF labeled ESA spectrum had a reduced intensity (10 3 ) compared to the IAA labeled ESA spectrum (10 4 ). Also, 6-IAF labeled ESA had lesser number of peaks, particularly larger than 2000 m/z molecular ion peaks were rarely observed.

An IAA labeled free cysteine fragment as well as the disulfide bonded peptide clusters Lysc2, 4, and 5 (from the Table 3-2) were detected. Total sequence coverage including free cysteine fragments was 54.0 % (Figure 3-21). Carboxymethylated ESA red was also measured using DHB and produced 89.1 % sequence coverage with higher MS signal intensities (10 5 ) as shown in the Figures 3-22 and 23. The MS spectrum of ESA red peptides had a higher intensity throughout the entire spectrum. The spectrum of IAA labeled ESA ox (Figure 3-20) was observed with lesser intensity (10\n\n4 ) and also noticeable intensity gaps were seen between peaks of disulfide bonded peptide clusters and nondisulfide bonded fragments. For example, disulfide bonded clusters Lysc4 and Lysc5 had intensities of approximately 0.2 x 10 4 a.u.

Presence of glycoprotein in gel was indicated with pink color stain.\n\nPhosphoprotein detection was performed using the phosphoprotein gel staining kit on the same gel used for the glycoprotein detection.   IAA labeling of the protein is a very important tool for peptide mapping along with the labeling with fluorescein. It covalently alkylates free sulfurs and therefore blocks any unwanted oxidations that would interfere which interpreting the data. As shown in the Figure 3-10, when IAA attaches to the free sulfur, both the I -and H + are products of the reaction. This modification causes the cysteine containing fragments to gain 57 molecular mass per cysteine and this should be small enough compound to go and interact with a tightly folded protein to label any free sulfhydryl group in the native protein. Labeling the fully reduced protein helps to make sure that the protein will fully unfold during the proteolytic digestion process.\n\nThe chemically modified samples were digested with two different enzymes;\n\ntrypsin and Lys-C. The units of enzymes as well as the wash and extraction procedures were identical for both enzymes. Comparing these two enzymes, they both have similar activities and cleavage preferences. Trypsin cleaves protein at a C-terminus of both arginines and lysines while Lys-C specifically cleaves only at a C-teminus of lysines.\n\nThese enzymes both have pH optima of 7 to 9 and are mostly resistant to 0.1 % SDS, 1M urea, or up to 10 % acetonitrile (Product information from Promega and Roche).\n\nHowever a notable difference is the cost for conducting a single experiment. In our protocol, it only costs $ 0.19 for trypsin while costs $5.52 for Lys-C to digest the same sample. This significant difference in cost between two enzymes seems to reflect the percent sequence coverage obtained for ESA sample. Besides trypsin and Lys-C, chymotrypsin was used either independently or in combination with the other enzymes.\n\nHowever, due to lack in the specificity of chymotrypsin, satisfactory data were not obtained.\n\nUsing the synthesized vasopressin, the reducing capability of DAN was tested.\n\nSynthesized vasopressin was first analyzed with the MS using CCA as a matrix. The oxidized vasopressin spectrum (blue line) in the Figure 3-12 indicated a peak at 1085.4 m/z with the highest intensity. Vasopressin was then analyzed using DAN to confirm its reducing capability. The MS spectrum obtained using the DAN (red line) showed a peak shift (to the higher mass) between the oxidized and reduced vasopressin. The reduced vasopressin had a molecular ion of [M+H] + = 1087.5 which also produced the highest intensity peak in the spectrum. Although the majority of the peak indicated a reduced vasopressin, a minor oxidized vasopressin peak was still detected. Based on this experiment, reducing capability of DAN was verified but not at 100 % efficiency for this sample. MS measurements using DAN as the matrix can be challenging mainly due to its preparation. DAN must be prepared immediately before applying to the sample plate because it quickly self-oxidizes within the solution. Also after the DAN solution was prepared, it needed to be kept in dark to avoid chemical reaction caused by exposure to light. The crystal of the peptide-DAN mixture formation on the MALDI target plate also contributes to improved sample ionization.\n\nAs shown in the Figure 3-13, 5 out of 9 trypsin digested disulfide bonded oxidized peptide clusters (from Table 3- Using Lys-C as a primary proteolytic enzyme is not recommended due to its higher cost.\n\nFor determining the cleaved peptides, the MS method used predominantly in these experiments was MALDI-TOF positive ion reflector mode. This method only detects fragments which have a total positive ion charge. Since extracted fragments were resuspended in 0.1 % TFA and DHB was also dissolved in 33 % acetonitrile/ 0.1 % TFA, sample applied to the MS measurement was dried in an acidic environment. This condition protonates all the acidic amino acids such is glutamic acid and aspartic acid, thereby making peptides containing acidic amino acids measurable. However, the intensity of the fragment peaks containing large number of acidic amino acids were generally lower due to a decrease in sensitivity. Decreases in the sensitivity are generally caused by poor ionization and also higher mass molecular ions.\n\nThe reason that we are not able to detect all of the disulfide bonded clusters can be explained by a difference in the energy absorption among the digested fragments.\n\nSome digested fragments were more easily ionized compared to the others. Easily ionized fragments absorb more energy from the energy source leaving less energy to ionize the other fragments. In other words, MS measurements are sequence dependant.\n\nIt also signifies that the hydrophobic samples are easier to ionize into the gas-phase and be detected while highly hydrophilic samples are not.\n\nMiscleavage by the enzyme can be another reason for not recovering some fragments. Miscleavage of the fragments generates new higher molecular weight fragments. When the total molecular weight of the disulfide bonded cluster increases, the total ionization potential of the cluster can be decreased due to the presence of the additional amino acids. In this case, poor ionization of the cluster could lead to not identifying certain clusters. Overall, the sequence of ESA contains a large number of lysine and arginine. Some of those cleavage sites could be located in the buried section of the native (oxidized) sample that was inaccessible to the protease. As discussed in the introduction, the presence of disulfide bonds in the sample reduces the ionization potential of the segment. This condition also contributes greatly to the lowering of the peak intensity.\n\nreducing ability of DAN, reduced fragments within an undetected disulfide linked peak become identified. In other words, DAN helps to distinguish between intra and interpeptide disulfide bonds within a digested peptide. If interpeptide disulfide bonds were formed, 2 additional peaks appear while the oxidized peak disappears or decreases.\n\nWith the presence of an intrapeptide disulfide bond, the identified peak shifts 2 mass units higher. DAN is a new type of matrix which can reduce existing disulfide bonds without pre-treating a sample with any reducing reagent. This unique property of DAN contributes greatly to the field of protein structural analysis not only by shortening the analysis time, but also excluding the addition of any extra reducing chemicals or salts to the sample which could potentially interfere with the MS measurement.\n\nThe MS/MS measurements were carried out to identify the peak 1231 m/z (Figure Additional protein data bases, a variety of search engines using different algorithms and de novo sequencing programs, are also contributing to the rapid process in protein identification.\n\nThe sequence coverage obtained for each experiment is summarized in the\n\nFigures 4-1 and 4-2 for oxidized and reduced ESA samples, respectively. Sequences generated by only trypsin are indicated in red, only Lys-C is blue, and by both enzymes is indicated in purple. Sequences which were not identified using either enzymes are indicated in black. Lys-C digestion (Red) generated more sequences that were not covered by the trypsin digestion (Blue) within the native ESA ox sample, which again confirms the higher detection rate for this enzyme. Residues 20-28, GVLRRDTHK, in the ESA red were not detected by either enzymes (indicated in black). While fragments up to Arg 19 generated by trypsin digestion were identified, the theoretical fragment generated by the Lys-C hydrolysis (residues 3-28: [M+H] + = 3085.673 m/z) was not detected due to its large ion mass. The two sequences containing adjacent cysteine residues, 383-4 and 581-2 (underlined) were not discovered either in native (oxidized) or reduced ESA samples. This could be indicating that those cys-cys residues are located in the tightly folded motif where either IAA or enzymes were not able to reach.\n\nAdditionally, it is also possible that in the native ESA ox sample, the presence of asparatic acids and glutamic acids near cys-cys residues are making negatively charged fragments which cannot be detected by the applied measuring method. Even though the ESA sample was prepared in the acidic environment prior to the MS measurement, these particular fragments could not be fully protonated which, as result, caused poor ionization of the fragments. The presence of an intrapeptide bond between Cys 383 -Cys 392 could also be one of the reasons to cause the poor ionization due to the energy absorption by the cysteines.\n\nimportant to identify the appropriate matrix for each experiment in order to achieve the best ionization for the sample. Obtaining good crystallization of the matrix on the target plate is also a critical item along with finding an optimal sample-to-matrix ratio. Figures  6). However, even though the crystal was formed, no detectable peaks were observed during the MS measurement.\n\nIt is important to adjust the type, concentration, and the ratio of matrix in order to achieve better MS measurements. Knowing the characteristics of the sample and adjusting the matrix referring to the each sample leads to improved MS measurements. Figure 4-4 DAN crystal\n\nAs the glycoprotein stained gel image in the Figure 3-25 shows, no glycosylation in the native ESA ox was detected. Using the glycosylation staining kit was a very quick and easy way to probe for the glycoproteins. The whole staining process took less than 2 hours and there were no additional or unusual chemicals required. However, this method can be unreliable considering the sensitivity of the staining kit. Horseradish peroxidase (HP), 5 μg was used as a positive control (included in the kit), and has numerous glycosylation sites. According to the instruction, as little as 0.16 μg of HP can be detected using this staining kit. This suggests that in cases with samples containing only a few glycosylation sites or samples at lower concentration, glycosylation might not be detected. Additionally, in order to assign the glycosylation sites, another method must be applied. MS has often been used for mapping glycosylation sites after glycosylated sample was pre-treated with a glycosidase. Mass differences observed between glycosylated and deglycosylated samples can be measured using MS to assign glycosylated sites to certain peptides. For more precise mapping, one can combine this technique with liquid chromatography (LC/MS), to more easily detect the glycosylation sites. 3\n\nPhosphorylation of the ESA ox sample was confirmed using the phosphoprotein gel staining kit. As shown in the Figure 3\n\nFree cysteine and disulfide bonds present in the equine serum albumin (ESA) were characterized by using MALDI-TOF MS. After chemical modifications of the sample and matrix adjustments, majority of the expected disulfide bonded clusters were assigned which matched with the disulfide mapping reported from the x-ray crystallography experiment. 28 Total sequence coverage of native and reduced ESA reached to 73.6 % and 92.6 %, respectively when combining both the trypsin and Lys-C data. Acquired data from this experiment using MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the disulfide bonds sites reported by x-ray crystallography, but in a much more efficient way.\n\nModifying the free cysteine in the ESA ox was an important step before proceeding to the further analysis. Labeling the free cysteine with florescent dye (6-IAF) was effective because not only was the reaction irreversible, but also because it was visible to unaided eyes. Due to a large number of disulfide bonds present in the native ESA ox , some of the digested fragments were still cross-linked after denaturation. However, using DAN, a new type of reducing matrix, those disulfide bonds were reduced instantly on the sample plate with just the addition of MALDI laser energy. Additionally, since the sample was separated, labeled and digested within the gel, more MS peaks with higher intensities and sensitivities were obtained. These facts make it possible to achieve higher sequence coverage of the protein which is important for the characterization of the protein sequences along with the assignment of all the PTM sites. Figure 5-1 is a summary of an optimized protocol based on our studies. For the disulfide bond mapping using MALDI-TOF MS, it is recommended to follow such protocol for obtaining better results.\n\nMALDI-TOF MS is one of the common protein analysis tools that can provide extensive information in a short time frame while keeping the sample in its native state.\n\nA protein containing disulfide bonds is poorly ionized with MALDI which leading to a decrease in the sensitivity of the instrument. However, by using a new type of matrix and performing a sample digestion with suitable proteolytic enzymes, it is possible to overcome such problems. Nowadays, the investigation of PTMs has been a big focus in the field of proteomics.\n\nEven though different separation techniques or ionization Appendix A -Trypsin digested fragments 912.878 841.944 1594.965 986.941 1454.923 1192.872 1414.837 1873.918 1148.884 x10 Intens.
