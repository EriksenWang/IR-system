    "abstract": "EHD1 has been implicated in the recycling of internalized proteins to the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which EHD1 mediates recycling and its relationship to Rab-family-controlled events has yet to be established. To investigate further the mode of EHD1 action, we sought to identify novel interacting partners. GST-EHD1 was used as bait to isolate a ~120 kD species from bovine and murine brain cytosol, which was identified by mass spectometry as the divalent Rab4/Rab5 effector, Rabenosyn-5. We mapped the sites of interaction to the EH domain of EHD1, and the first two of five NPF motifs of Rabenosyn-5. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 partially co-localize to vesicular and tubular structures in vivo. To address the functional roles of EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5, we first demonstrated that RNA interference (RNAi) dramatically reduced the level of expression of each protein, either individually or in combination. Depletion of either EHD1 or Rabenosyn-5 delayed the recycling of transferrin and MHC Class I to the plasma membrane. However, whereas depletion of EHD1 caused the accumulation of internalized cargo in a compact juxtanuclear compartment, Rabenosyn-5-RNAi caused its retention within a dispersed peripheral compartment. Simultaneous RNAi depletion of both proteins resulted in a similar phenotype to that observed with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi alone, suggesting that Rabenosyn-5 acts prior to EHD1 in the regulation of endocytic recycling. Our studies suggest that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 act sequentially in the transport of proteins from early endosomes to the endosomal recycling compartment and back to the plasma membrane.",
    "full_text": "The ability of cells to internalize plasma membrane proteins is key to many essential physiologic processes such as nutrient uptake, retrieval of exocytosed synaptic vesicle components, and the regulated expression of signaling receptors, transmembrane ligands, membrane transporters, and adhesion molecules (Mellman, 1996;Conner and Schmid, 2003). Plasma membrane proteins can be internalized by either clathrin-mediated or nonclathrin-mediated pathways, in both cases resulting in the delivery of the proteins into the endosomal system (Nichols and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2001;Johannes and Lamaze, 2002;Conner and Schmid, 2003). Just as critical is the ability to return a subset of the internalized proteins, in particular endocytic receptors, from endosomes to the plasma membrane, so that they can participate in additional rounds of endocytic uptake. Two distinct recycling pathways have been described. A fast recycling pathway takes proteins directly from early endosomes to the plasma membrane (Sheff et al., 1999;Hao and Maxfield, 2000;van Dam et al., 2002;Sheff et al., 2002), while a second, slow pathway involves passage through a pericentriolar endosomal compartment known as the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) (reviewed by Gruenberg and Maxfield, 1995).\n\nThe ERC has been described as a dense collection of tubular structures that radiate from the microtubule-organizing center (Hopkins and Trowbridge, 1983;Yamashiro et al., 1984).\n\nWhereas the molecular machinery involved in endocytosis has been characterized in great detail (Mellman, 1996;Conner and Schmid, 2003;Gruenberg, 2003), the mechanisms responsible for recycling to the cell surface are less well understood. Rab GTPases such as Rab4 (van der Sluijs et al., 1992;Daro et al., 1996;Sheff et al., 1999) and Rab11 (Ullrich et al., 1996;Ren et al., 1998;Sheff et al., 1999;Zeng et al., 1999), as well as their corresponding effectors (Zeng 1999;Mammoto 1999;Nagelkerken 2000;Prekeris 2000;Cormont 2001;Hales 2001;de Renzis 2002;Lindsay 2002;Sonnischen 2002;Wallace 2002a;Wallace 2002b;Cormont 2003;Deneka 2003;Fouraux 2004), have been implicated in recycling of internalized receptors. In addition, a genetic screen for C. elegans mutants defective in receptor-mediated uptake of yolk protein resulted in the identification of another component of the recycling machinery, the protein RME-1 (Grant et al., 2001). C. elegans RME-1 is homologous to the family of human proteins named EHD1, EHD2, EHD3 and EHD4 (Mintz et al., 1999;Pohl et al., 2000). EHD family members are characterized by an N-terminal P-loop domain with nucleotide binding motifs, a central coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal Eps15-homology (EH) domain (Mintz et al., 1999;Pohl et al., 2000) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the inhibition of yolk protein endocytosis upon RNA interference (RNAi) of RME-1 in C. elegans appears to be secondary to impaired recycling of the yolk protein receptor (Grant et al., 2001). In mammalian cells, EHD1 has been shown to control ERC morphology (Lin et al., 2001), and to regulate the recycling of the transferrin receptor (TfR) (Lin et al., 2001) and Major Histocompatiblity Complex Class I molecules (MHC-I) (Caplan et al., 2002) to the plasma membrane, with little or no direct effect on internalization.\n\nTo date, the relationship between the Rab-regulated steps and EHD1 has not been established. In this study, we identify the divalent Rab4/Rab5 effector Rabenosyn-5 (Nielsen et al., 2000;De Renzis et al., 2002) as an interaction partner for EHD1, and present evidence that this interaction regulates recycling by mediating transport of receptors from early endosomes to the ERC.\n\nRecombinant DNA constructs. Full-length EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 constructs, as well as Rabenosyn-5 truncations in pGEM used for in vitro binding assays were described previously (Nielsen et al., 2000;Caplan et al., 2002;De Renzis et al., 2002). Mutations in full-length Rabenosyn-5 to change individual NPF motifs to APA were introduced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as per the manufacturer's instructions. GST-EHD1 was obtained by subcloning EHD1 into the pGEX 4T-1 vector, and GST-β3ear, GST-GGA1-hinge, and GST-GGA2-hinge have been described previously (Mattera et al., 2003). Two-hybrid constructs for full-length Rabenosyn-5, full-length EHD1, and the EH domain of EHD1 were generated by subcloning into the pGBKT7 and pGADT7 two-hybrid vectors. For both full-length EHD1 and the EH domain of EHD1, tryptophan 485 was mutated to alanine using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit. EHD2 and EHD3 were obtained from HeLa mRNA by RT PCR and subcloned into pGBKT7. The sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.\n\nAntibodies. Purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Rabenosyn-5 has been described previously (Nielsen et al., 2000). Rabbit antibodies were prepared against an N-terminal peptide (MFSWVSKDARRKKEP) of EHD1 (AnaSpec, Inc, San Jose, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to EEA1 and Rab5 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), W6/32 antibody to MHC-I (peptide-bound) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the 9E10 antibody to the Myc epitope was from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Cy-3-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG, as well as Alexa-488-conjugated antibody to mouse and rabbit IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).\n\nIdentification of Rabenosyn-5 as an EHD1 binding partner. GST-EHD1 (50µg protein) was bound to 30 µl Glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry in a volume of 1 ml PBS with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (GST-binding-buffer), washed 4 times with GST-binding-buffer and incubated in the presence of either 2 ml bovine brain cytosol or 2 ml murine brain cytosol for 3 h at 4 0 C. Beads were sedimented, and new brain cytosol was added. This step was repeated three times. Precipitates were washed four times with GST-binding-buffer, twice with the same buffer lacking Triton X-100, eluted, and separated by 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The ~120 kD band visualized by Coomassie Blue specifically after pulldown with GST-EHD1, as well as the corresponding region of the gel for GST-control fusion proteins were excised, destained, and in-gel digested using modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting peptides were extracted and subjected to analysis by LC-MS/MS. Aliquots of the sample were injected onto a capillary gradient MAGIC LC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) operated at 400 nL/min using a constant pressure splitter and separated using a 10 min linear gradient. A 75 mm I.D. fused silica capillary PicoFritAE (New Objective, Woburn, MA) column packed with a Vydac C18 resin (5 mm particle, 300 ≈ pore) of approximately 5 cm in length was used for the liquid chromatography. The LC effluent was electrosprayed directly into the sampling orifice of an LCQ DECA (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) using an adaptation of the microscale electrospray interface method (Davis et al., 1995). The LCQ DECA was operated in a mode that automatically generated MS-MS spectra of the three most intense peaks present in the full MS scan of the ion trap that exceeded a pre-set threshold.\n\nPeptide partial internal sequence data produced by the LC-MS/MS experiments were subjected to analysis using both MASCOT (Perkins et al., 1999) and SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) programs, employing the mammalian portion of the NCBI non-redundant data base for the database searches. Sequences of bovine peptides identified that specifically bound to GST-EHD1 were: SHLSDFKK, TLQENLR, TLQENLRQLQDEYDQQQTEK, and QLQDEYDQQQTEK.\n\nOther biochemical assays. Confirmation of Rabenosyn-5 binding to EHD1 was achieved by pull-down assays performed as described above, either using bovine brain cytosol as input, or 35 S-labeled in vitro transcription/translation products (Promega). For the former, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting was performed utilizing anti-Rabenosyn-5 antiserum. Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image (v1.62).\n\nImmunofluorescence, fluorescence recycling assays and quantitation. HeLa cells were grown on cover-glasses, transfected using FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and fixed with 4% v/v paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody mixture containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at room temperature. To specifically detect proteins on the plasma membrane, antibody binding (primary and secondary) was done in the absence of saponin. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 410 or Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using a 63X 1.4NA objective with appropriate filters. Transferrin recycling was measured by first starving cells in DMEM lacking serum (but containing 0.5% BSA) for 23 min, and then applying a 15 min pulse with Transferrin-Alexa-Fluor 568 (Tf-568; Molecular Probes). The labeled transferrin was then chased for the indicated times by incubating the cells in full medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml unlabeled transferrin at 37 0 C, and cells were then fixed and processed as described above. For quantitative analysis, 30-50 cells were randomly chosen and scanned with an open pinhole, allowing fluorescence to be collected from the entire depth of the cell. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) imaging was utilized to determine the boundaries of each cell, and LSM software was used to obtain mean fluorescence values. MHC-I recycling was analyzed by performing a 20 min pulse with W6/32 anti-MHC-I, followed by a 20 second acid strip (0.5% acetic acid, 500 mM NaCl) to remove residual surface-bound (non-internalized) antibody (Le Gall et al., 2000;Means et al., 2002;Naslavsky et al., 2003). Cells were returned to 37 0 C for 30 min chase in full media, fixed and processed as above. In this case, a secondary Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was utilized to label the remaining (non-recycled) intracellular pool of MHC-I.\n\nQuantitation of cell surface transferrin receptor levels was achieved by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) using 10,000 HeLa cells that were released into suspension by a 30 second incubation with either trypsin or EDTA (100mM) at 37 0 C. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained first with anti-transferrin receptor antibodies (Zymed), and then with an anti-mouse 488-Alexa secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Quantitation was also achieved by immunofluorescence microscopy, as described above. In the latter case, the statistical significance of the differences observed for the various treatments was calculated using the One-Way Analysis of Variance for Independent or Correlated Samples (ANOVA). Quantitation of co-localization was done using LSM software, setting thresholds levels by extracting the mean background signal.\n\nGene knockdown by RNAi. RNAi duplexes (synthesized by Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were transfected using oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) essentially by the method of Elbashir and colleagues (Elbashir et al., 2001). Calibration experiments demonstrated that either 48 or 72 h of treatment was sufficient to lower the expression of EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 to less than 10% of mock-treated cells. The sequence used for Rabenosyn-5 (base pairs 1559-1579) was: cagctgcagatgttgcgtg , and the sequence used for EHD1 (base pairs 943-963) was gaaagagatgcccaatgtc.\n\nOther procedures. Yeast two-hybrid analysis using the strain AH109 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was performed as previously described (Caplan et al., 2001).\n\nEHD1 has been shown to play a role in the recycling of internalized proteins from the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to the plasma membrane (Lin et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002;Picciano et al., 2003). However, little is known about its mechanism of action and, in particular, how it might connect with Rab proteins involved in the recycling pathway. Accordingly, we sought to identify components of the recycling machinery that interact with EHD1. To this end, recombinant, full-length EHD1 was expressed as a GST-fusion protein, and used as bait in pull-down assays utilizing either bovine or murine brain cytosol. Bound and eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B). Pull-down experiments using bovine brain cytosol resulted in the isolation of a ~120kD species (Fig. 1B; asterisk and dashed arrow) that was specific for GST-EHD1, but not GST-GGA1-hinge (Fig. 1B) or other GST fusion proteins (our unpublished results). Other proteins on the gel either bound to all the GST fusion proteins tested or could not be visualized because of interference by degradation products of the GST fusion proteins (i.e., those of ~80kD or less). Similar results were obtained using murine brain cytosol as a protein source (our unpublished results). Mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) of tryptic peptides derived from the specific ~120kD species from both bovine and murine sources resulted in the identification of four peptides matching the sequence of orthologs of the divalent Rab4 and Rab5 effector, Rabenosyn-5 (Nielsen et al., 2000;De Renzis et al., 2002) (Fig. 1A).\n\nTo confirm the association of EHD1 with Rabenosyn-5, we performed immunoblot analysis of proteins isolated in GST pull-down experiments from bovine brain cytosol (Fig. 1C). We observed that an antiserum to Rabenosyn-5 recognized a band of ~120kD from bovine brain cytosol (Fig. 1C; BBC input) as well as from a pull-down with GST-EHD1 but not with other GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). In addition, radiolabeled, in vitro transcribed-translated Rabenosyn-5 was generated and assayed for binding to GST-EHD1, or to control proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, only GST-EHD1 bound to Rabenosyn-5. These experiments thus identified Rabenosyn-5 as a specific binding partner for EHD1.\n\nA prominent feature of EHD1 is its C-terminal EH-domain (Fig. 1A), which for other proteins has been demonstrated to bind the asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif (DeBeer et al., 1998;DeBeer et al., 2000). We therefore hypothesized that the EH domain of EHD1 could interact with either of five NPF motifs present in Rabenosyn-5 (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis, we performed yeast two-hybrid analyses. As shown in Fig. 2A (bottom panel; -His), both full-length EHD1 and its isolated EH domain were capable of interacting with Rabenosyn-5. Moreover, other EHD family members (i.e., EHD2 and EHD3), which also contain EH domains, similarly interacted with Rabenosyn-5 (Fig. 2A). A conserved tryptophan residue within the EH domain of other EHcontaining proteins has been shown to be critical for interactions with NPF motifs (DeBeer et al., 2000). Mutation of the homologous tryptophan 485 of EHD1 in the context of the full-length protein or its isolated EH domain abrogated interactions with Rabenosyn-5 (Fig. 2B, bottom panel; -His). These results hinted at EH-domain-NPF motif interactions as the probable basis for the binding of EHD1 to Rabenosyn-5.\n\nTo delineate the region of Rabenosyn-5 that is required for binding to EHD1, a series of deletions and truncations of Rabenosyn-5 produced by in vitro transcription-translation were utilized for binding assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length Rabenosyn-5 (FL) or mutants deleted in the N-terminal region (i.e., 264-784, ∆C2H2) bound efficiently to GST-EHD1. In contrast, proteins truncated in the C-terminal region displayed impaired binding to EHD1 (Fig. 3A). Loss of the five NPF motifs (as in the 100-263, 264-500, 501-626 constructs) resulted in complete abrogation of binding, while inclusion of all five NPF motifs in a short deletion construct (501-784) displayed significant, albeit reduced, binding. The short 627-784 Rabenosyn-5 deletion, which contains the last four NPF motifs but lacks the first NPF, did not bind to EHD1 (Fig. 3A), indicating either that this truncated protein is improperly folded or that the first NPF motif is critical for binding. Overall, these results highlight the importance of the Rabenosyn-5 C-terminal region for binding to EHD1 and further indicate the likelihood of EH-domain-NPF motif interactions.\n\nTo address this directly, we generated a series of NPF mutants. Each of the individual NPF motifs was mutated to APA, leaving the proline residue intact to avoid structural changes (Martina et al., 2001). In addition, a double-mutant with substitution of the first two NPF motifs was also generated. As shown in Fig. 3B, and quantified in Fig. 3C, more than 60% of the binding to EHD1 was lost when either the first or second NPF motifs were mutated. Mutations in both of the first two NPF motifs resulted in very weak binding, at less than 10% of the wild-type full-length protein (WT). These data are consistent with the EHD1 EH domain interacting with Rabenosyn-5 primarily via its first two NPF motifs.\n\nWe and others have previously shown that EHD1 and other EHD family proteins localize to membrane-bound vesicular and tubular structures (Rotem-Yehudar et al., 2001;Lin et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002;Galperin et al., 2002;Shao et al., 2002). Rabenosyn-5 has also been observed in association with vesicular structures (Nielsen et al., 2000). To determine whether EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 co-localize, Myc-EHD1 was transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 4A-C). This transfection approach was necessary because antibodies to EHD1 gave very weak staining for the endogenous protein. EHD1 was found to colocalize with endogenous and transgenic Rabenosyn-5 on cytoplasmic vesicles and tubules (Fig. 4A, B; yellow arrows). The overlap, however, was partial since EHD1 tended to be on tubular structures and Rabenosyn-5 on vesicular structures. Quantitation by confocal microscopy indicates that 5-10% of GFP-EHD1 co-localizes Rabenosyn-5, while about 3-5% of Rabenosyn-5 is found on common structures with GFP-EHD1.\n\nTaken together with the binding of EHD1 to Rabenosyn-5, these data indicate that EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 might functionally interact in endocytic/recycling pathways.\n\nPrevious studies utilizing over-expression and dominant-negative approaches have implicated both EHD1 (Lin et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002) and Rabenosyn-5 (De Renzis et al., 2002) in endocytic recycling events. We hypothesized that the absence of expression of either of these proteins should similarly result in impaired recycling to the plasma membrane. To this end, we undertook an RNAi approach to block expression of EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 in HeLa cells. The effects of RNAi were assessed by immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). Immunoblotting of HeLa cell lysates with antibodies to Rabenosyn-5 revealed a specific ~120kD band in untreated cells (UT), cells treated with mock-RNAi (Mock), and cells treated with irrelevant RNAi (Fig. 5A; top panel). This band was not detected in cells treated with RNAi specific for Rabenosyn-5 (Fig. 5A; top panel). As a control, nitrocellulose blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to α-tubulin, demonstrating similar levels of protein in all lysates (Fig. 5A; bottom panel). Immunofluorescent staining of mocktreated cells with antibody to Rabenosyn-5 revealed a pattern of endogenous cytoplasmic vesicles and tubules (Fig. 5C), as previously described (Nielsen et al., 2000;De Renzis et al., 2002). In agreement with the immunoblot analysis, treatment with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi resulted in a dramatic reduction in the intensity of immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5D). Immunoblotting with an antibody to endogenous EHD1 in mock-treated cell lysates revealed a band of ~55kD and a second band of ~68kD (Fig. 5B; left panel), as previously reported (Rotem-Yehudar et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002). RNAi for EHD1 almost completely eliminated the ~55kD band, indicating that this corresponds to endogenous EHD1. Mock-and EHD1-RNAi-treated cells were also transfected with Myc-EHD1, and subjected to the same immunoblotting analysis using anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 5B; right panel). A single band at ~55kD was visualized in the mocktreated lysates but not in the EHD1-RNAi lysate, thus confirming the efficacy of the RNAi approach. To analyze EHD1-RNAi efficacy by immunofluorescence microscopy, it was necessary to transfect the cells with a tagged construct (i.e., GFP-EHD1, Fig. 5, E and F) because our antibodies to EHD1 do not work well for immunofluorescent staining of the endogenous protein. As shown in Figs. 5, E and F, mock-treated cells displayed typical EHD1 vesicles and tubules, whereas EHD1-RNAi cells showed no staining.\n\nThese results indicate that the expression of both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 can be specifically abolished with RNAi treatment.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that loss of RME-1/EHD1 expression in C. elegans inhibits yolk protein endocytosis, primarily due to retention of the yolk protein receptor in an expanded endocytic compartment, and it has been proposed that delayed recycling decreases yolk receptor expression on the plasma membrane (Grant et al., 2001). Since overexpression of dominant-negative mammalian EHD1 proteins interferes with the recycling of transferrin receptor and MHC-I to the plasma membrane (Lin et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002), we hypothesized that RNAi-based knock-down of EHD1 and/or Rabenosyn-5 in human HeLa cells might reduce the levels of transferrin receptor localized to the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 6, Rabenosyn-5-RNAi treatment led to a ~27% (p<0.01) reduction of transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane at steady state compared to mock-treated cells as calculated by quantitation of fluorescence on the cell surface. EHD1-RNAi treatment led to a 38% (p<0.01) decrease in plasma membrane levels of transferrin receptor compared to mock-treated cells. In agreement with these results, experiments performed utilizing Transferrin-Alexa-Fluor 568 (Tf-568) as a ligand for the cell-surface expressed transferrin receptor also indicated that there are decreased levels of transferrin receptor localized to the plasma membrane. About a 40% (p<0.01) and 20% (p<0.01) decrease in bound ligand was observed following Rabenosyn-5-RNAi and EHD1-RNAi treatments, respectively, compared to mock-treated cells. No statistically significant difference in plasma membrane levels of transferrin receptor was observed when Rabenosyn-5-RNAi and EHD1-RNAi treatments were compared directly.\n\nTo verify these findings using a larger sample population, we performed flow cytometry analysis, comparing the levels of transferrin receptor expressed on 10,000 cells from each treatment (Fig. 6, black columns). By this assay, the level of transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane at steady state in mock-treated cells was 22% higher than in Rabenosyn-5-and EHD1-RNAi-treated cells. These data are consistent with both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 regulating recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane.\n\nBased on the observations shown in Fig. 6, as well as previous evidence for a role of Rabenosyn-5 (De Renzis et al., 2002) and EHD1 (Lin et al., 2001;Grant et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002) in recycling, we hypothesized that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 regulate recycling events en route to the plasma membrane. To address this hypothesis, we obtained quantitative data comparing the kinetics of recycling in mock-, Rabenosyn-5and EHD1-RNAi treated HeLa cells (Fig. 7A). In these experiments, recycling was measured by pulsing the cells with fluorochrome-labeled transferrin (Tf-568), and analyzing the loss of intracellular Tf-568 over time (during a 'chase' in the presence of excess non-labeled transferrin). Since the steady-state levels of transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane are about 20% lower in cells treated with either Rabenosyn-5-or EHD1-RNAi (see Fig. 6), it was necessary to normalize the initial levels of internalized ('pulsed') transferrin for each treatment, so that the rates of recycling could be compared.\n\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 7A, after 10, 15 and 25 min of chase, there was a significant decrease in the rate of transferrin recycling in HeLa cells treated with Rabenosyn-5-or EHD1-RNAi (compared to mock-treated cells). Thus, the amount of recycled transferrin is impacted in two ways by the loss of either Rabenosyn-5 or EHD1, as a result of: (1) less transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane at steady-state (and subsequently, less binding and internalization of transferrin), and (2) a slower rate of recycling of transferrin and its receptor to the plasma membrane.\n\nTo visualize cargo-recycling we analyzed the distribution of internalized Tf-568 (Fig. 7B-E) or antibody to MHC-I (Fig. 7F-I) in pulse-chase experiments by confocal microscopy comparing cells treated with mock-, Rabenosyn-5-or EHD1-RNAi. After 15 min internalization of Tf-568 or anti-MHC-I, followed by a 15 min chase, cells treated with mock-RNAi emptied of Tf-568 (Fig. 7B) and anti-MHC-I (Fig. 7F), as a result of recycling to the plasma membrane. Cells treated with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi displayed a decreased rate of recycling of Tf-568 (Fig. 7C) and MHC-I (Fig. 7G), with the cargo being retained longer in a dispersed, peripheral compartment. Treatment with EHD1-RNAi also slowed recycling of Tf-568 and anti-MHC-I, but these cargo proteins accumulated in a compact, pericentriolar compartment (Fig. 7D and H) reminiscent of the compartment described upon overexpression of a dominant-negative EHD1 mutant (Lin et al., 2001). These data collectively indicate that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 regulate recycling at distinct but partially overlapping stages of recycling.\n\nPrevious studies provide evidence that loss of EHD1 function causes a delay in recycling and accumulation of transferrin (Lin et al., 2001), MHC-I (Caplan et al., 2002) and cholesterol (Hao et al., 2002) at the endocytic recycling compartment.\n\nOverexpression of EHD1, on the other hand, does not significantly alter the morphology of transferrin-containing compartments (Supplemental Figure 1). To characterize the identity of the compartment within which transferrin accumulates upon Rabenosyn-5-RNAi treatment, mock-treated cells or cells treated with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi were subjected to pulse-chase recycling assays with Tf-568, and then fixed and immunostained with antibodies for the endocytic marker proteins EEA1 and Rab5 (Fig. 8). To view the co-localization of transferrin with EEA1 and Rab5 in the Mock-treated cells, the cells were pulsed without a chase, preventing the recycling and exit of Tf-568 from the cells (Fig. 8A-F). On the other hand, cells treated with RNAi for Rabenosyn-5 were chased for 10 min, to allow accumulation of the Tf-568 within the intracellular compartments (Fig. 8G-L). As expected, in mock-treated cells internalized transferrin was distributed primarily in small, dispersed, punctate compartments (Fig. 8B and E), showing substantial co-localization with EEA1 and Rab5 (Fig. 8A-F). In cells treated with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi, internalized transferrin accumulated in an intracellular vesicular compartment (Fig. 8H and K). These transferrin-containing vesicles appeared somewhat larger than those in the mock-treated cells, but they also substantially co-localized with both EEA1 and Rab5 (Fig. 8G-L), suggesting that Rabenosyn-5 affects transport through early endosomes. These data raise the question as to where endogenous Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 act in the endocytic pathway with respect to one another.\n\nWe hypothesized that these two proteins may act sequentially to control recycling to the plasma membrane, in which case the simultaneous absence of Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 should result in the accumulation of recycling cargo within the first of the two affected compartments. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that simultaneous treatment with RNAi for both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 reduces expression of both proteins in single cells (Fig. 9). To this end, mock-treated HeLa cells were co-transfected with Rabenosyn-5 and GFP-EHD1, and displayed good co-expression (>95%) and partial co-localization (Fig. 9A-C). When co-transfected cells were treated only with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi, expression of Rabenosyn-5, but not GFP-EHD1, was completely abolished (Fig. 9D-F). The reciprocal experiment, utilizing only EHD1-RNAi, demonstrated that GFP-EHD1 expression was abrogated, while Rabenosyn-5 expression remained intact (Fig. 9G-I). Finally, simultaneous treatment of HeLa cells with RNAi for both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 (combo-RNAi) resulted in loss of expression of both proteins (Fig. 9J-L), indicating the feasibility of this approach. Cells treated with combo-RNAi were then subjected to microscopic pulse-chase analysis using either Tf-568 (Fig. 7E) or antibody to MHC-I (Fig. 7I). Simultaneous reduction in expression of both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 resulted in a distribution pattern of Tf-568 (Fig. 7E) and anti-MHC-I (Fig. 7I) resembling that observed with only Rabenosyn-5-RNAi (7C and G).\n\nThese results support a model in which Rabenosyn-5 acts upstream of EHD1, probably by mediating transport from early endosomes to the ERC (see model in Fig. 10).\n\nUsing a combination of biochemical approaches, we have identified Rabenosyn-5 as a novel binding partner for EHD1. The interactions between these two proteins are mediated by the first two of five NPF motifs in Rabenosyn-5 and the EH domain of EHD1. The role of the other three NPF motifs in Rabenosyn-5 remains to be established; one possibility is that they are involved in binding other EH-domain-containing proteins.\n\nRabenosyn-5 and EHD1 co-localize to cytoplasmic vesicles and tubules, but this colocalization is partial. By quantitation, we estimate that 5-10% of EHD1 co-localizes with Rabenosyn-5, while 3-5% of Rabenosyn-5 co-localizes with EHD1. Rabenosyn-5 tends to give a more peripheral vesicular pattern, as previously reported (Nielsen et al. 2000), while EHD1 is also concentrated in tubules that radiate from the ERC (Lin et al., 2001;Rotem-Yehudar et al., 2001;Caplan et al., 2002) (Fig. 4). These observations are consistent with Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 being associated with successive compartments of the same pathway, with the overlap representing sites of interaction or transition between the two compartments.\n\nRNAi experiments with HeLa cells support the notion that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 function in the same membrane trafficking pathway. Consistent with previous studies involving overexpression of normal and mutant forms of these proteins (Nielsen et al., 2000;Lin et al., 2001;De Renzis et al., 2002;Caplan et al., 2002), our RNAi experiments demonstrated that both proteins are required for efficient recycling of internalized proteins to the plasma membrane. Internalized Tf-568 and anti-MHC-I in cells lacking Rabenosyn-5 were delayed in their ability to reach the ERC and hence the cell surface. Similarly, EHD1-depleted cells exhibited decreased recycling of both internalized proteins to the cell surface. Our kinetic analysis indicates that the rate of recycling is slower in cells treated with Rabenosyn-5-or EHD1-RNAi; however, over long periods of chase the internalized cargo is eventually recycled in these cells. This is consistent with the modest but measurable (~20%) decrease in the level of transferrin receptor localized to the plasma membrane at steady-state for Rabenosyn-5 -and EHD1-RNAi treated cells. These findings are also reminiscent of the changes observed in yolk receptor distribution in C. elegans upon loss of the EHD1 homolog (Grant et al., 2001). This reduced rate of transferrin and anti-MHC-I recycling by EHD1-RNAi occurred despite the existence of three other proteins closely related to EHD1, namely EHD2, EHD3 and EHD4 (Mintz et al., 1999;Pohl et al., 2000). This indicates that at least in HeLa cells, EHD1 is a key member of this family for the recycling of internalized proteins to the plasma membrane. The other family members may not be sufficiently active or abundant in HeLa cells to compensate for the loss of EHD1, and may be active in other cell types, consistent with a role described for EHD4/Pincher in nerve cells (Shao et al., 2002). Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that EHD2 plays a critical role in the internalization of transferrin into early endosomes in cultured adipocytes (Guilherme et al., 2003). Since transferrin and anti-MHC-I are internalized by clathrin-dependent and -independent processes, respectively (Naslavsky et al., 2003), our observations indicate that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 function after the merging of the two endocytic pathways.\n\nOur data demonstrate a similar decrease in the rate of recycling caused by the absence of either Rabenosyn-5 or EHD1. However, RNAi specific for either EHD1 or Rabenosyn-5 resulted in a different subcellular accumulation pattern of internalized cargo. Rabenosyn-5-RNAi caused the internalized cargo to accumulate in a dispersed, slightly enlarged vesicular compartment extending to the periphery of the cell (Fig. 7B and F); this compartment largely co-localized with the endosomal markers EEA1 and Rab5 (Figure 8A-F). Compartments containing accumulated transferrin in cells treated simultaneously with Rabenosyn-5-and EHD1-RNAi ('Combo'-RNAi) were similarly positive for early endosomal markers (our unpublished results). On the other hand, EHD1-RNAi caused delayed cargo recycling and retention in a tight, compact pericentriolar compartment characteristic of the ERC (Fig. 7D and H), and similar to the compartment described upon utilization of a dominant-negative EHD1 (Lin et al., 2001;Hao et al., 2002;Picciano et al., 2003).\n\nBased on the phenotypic differences observed following treatment with either Rabenosyn-5-RNAi or EHD1-RNAi, we hypothesize that these proteins act at consecutive stages of the recycling pathway. We cannot rule out the possible involvement of EHD1 in the regulation of the fast recycling pathway, directly from early endosomes to the plasma membrane (Fig. 10); indeed, little is known about the regulation of this pathway. However, the accumulation of internalized transferrin (and MHC-I) in a compact perinuclear region in the presence of EHD1-RNAi or a dominant-negative EHD1 (Lin et al., 2001;Hao et al., 2002;Picciano et al., 2003) fosters the notion that the primary site of EHD1 action is at the ERC. Moreover, our experiments simultaneously utilizing RNAi for both EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5 support a model in which Rabenosyn-5 is specifically involved in the transport of cargo from early endosomes to the ERC, whereas EHD1 participates in transport from the ERC to the plasma membrane (Fig. 10).\n\nRabenosyn-5 might thus serve as a relay, steering cargo from early endosomes to the ERC, where contact is made with EHD1-containing structures prior to returning to peripheral endosomes.\n\nAs a result of its location downstream from Rab5 and Rab4 but upstream from EHD1, Rabenosyn-5 may connect these two types of proteins involved in endosomal recycling. Rab4, in particular, is localized to a recycling domain of early endosomes (Daro et al., 1996;Sonnichsen et al., 2000) and regulates recycling to the plasma membrane (Van der Sluijs et al., 1992). Rab4 could recruit Rabenosyn-5 (De Renzis et al., 2002), after which Rabenosyn-5 could become incorporated into vesicular carriers that mediate transport from early to recycling endosomes. Rabenosyn-5 would then interact with EHD1 in the process of relaying cargo to the ERC. After dissociation from Rabenosyn-5, EHD1 would assume its role in recycling cargo to the plasma membrane via tubular and/or vesicular structures, possibly in conjunction with Rab11 and other recycling regulatory proteins.\n\nIn conclusion, our observations indicate that Rabenosyn-5 may serve as a nexus between Rab4 on early endosomes, and EHD1 on the ERC, thus linking consecutive molecular machineries involved in recycling internalized proteins to the plasma membrane.

After 48 h, the levels of transferrin receptor and/or bound transferrin on the plasma membrane were determined either by flow cytometry analysis or by confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry analysis, adherent HeLa cells were starved in serum free media for 30 min, released into suspension by a 30 sec incubation with trypsin or 100 mM EDTA, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Suspended cells were incubated with mouse anti-transferrin receptor antibodies and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibody. Data from 10,000 cells (for each treatment) was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson). The bar graph depicts the percentage of mean fluorescence counts for RNAi-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells in a representative experiment. For confocal microscopic analysis, HeLa cells were incubated on ice with Transferrin-Alexa-Fluor (Tf-568) extensively rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaledehyde, or fixed and then incubated with mouse anti-transferrin antibodies  and EHD1. Cells treated with mock-RNAi (A, B and F), RNAi specific for Rabenosyn-5 (A, C and G), RNAi specific for EHD1 (A, D and H), or combinations with RNAi for both proteins (E and I), were subjected to pulse-chase analysis with either Transferrin-Alexa-Fluor (Tf-568) (A, B-E) or with antibodies to MHC-I (F-I). In (A-I), cells were pulsed for 15 min and chased in full media (with excess unlabeled transferrin in A-I) for the indicated times.

Fixed-permeabilized cells were incubated first with mouse antibodies against EEA1 (A-C, G-I) or Rab5 (D-F, J-L), and then with secondary Alexa-488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (A-L). Images were obtained by confocal microscopy. Insets depict the co-localization of Tf-568 with EEA1 (G-I) and Rab5 (J-L) on vesicles in Rabenosyn-5-RNAi treated cells. Bar, 10 µm. HeLa cells were mock-treated (A-C), treated with RNAi specific for Rabenosyn-5 (D-F), or RNai specific for EHD1 (G-I), or treated simultaneously with RNAi specific for both Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 (J-L). 48 h later, cells were co-transfected with Rabenosyn-5 and GFP-EHD1. 72 h after the start of the RNAi treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Rabenosyn-5, followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (red channel). Over 300 cells were examined on 4 cover-glasses for each RNAi treatment to examine expression of GFP-EHD1 (B, E, H and K; green channel), and Rabenosyn-5 (A, D, G and J; red channel). The images shown are representative, with the efficacy for either individual or combination RNAi (Combo-RNAi) above 95%. Yellow arrows mark structures with colocalization of EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5. Bar, 10 µm. internalized into vesicles either via clathrin-coated pits or independently of clathrin\n\nquickly fuse with early endosomes (EE), which play a role in determining whether proteins are delivered to late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes (LYS) for degradation, or recycled to the plasma membrane. At least two partially distinct recycling pathways have been described. The first is a 'Fast Recycling' pathway that is thought to return cargo to the plasma membrane directly from the EE. The second recycling route is a slower pathway, by which receptors are recycled via the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). EHD1 appears to be involved primarily in the latter pathway, regulating the exit of receptors from the ERC. Rabenosyn-5 appears to be critical for transport from the EE to the ERC, but a role cannot be ruled out in direct recycling from the EE to the plasma membrane.
