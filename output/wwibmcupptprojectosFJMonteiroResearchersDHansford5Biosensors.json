    "full_text": "The ability to create well-defined and controlled interfaces has been an area of great interest over the last few years, particularly in the biomedical arena. Of particular interest is the development and characterization of well-controlled, stable, and uniform membranes capable of biomolecular separation for implantable biosensors and protein filtration applications. In such applications, the membrane must exhibit minimal fouling and structural stability under a wide range of biological conditions (i.e. temperature, pH, humidity, and enzymatic activity). Additionally, parameters such as biocompatibility, appropriate diffusion kinetics, and a diminished response to interfering materials are all critical elements to the development of the successful implantable biosensor (Turner et al., 1991).\n\nSeveral glucose sensors have been developed, but many challenges remain yet to be overcome for commercial application (Gough et al., 1995;Gough, 1988). For instance, the main problem associated with amperometric glucose sensors is interference with the sensor signals by the direct electrooxidation of organic chemicals present in physiologic fluids. The usual way to overcome this is to employ any of a number of different types of protective membranes or coatings. However, several problems are also associated with these membranes. For example, Nafion-based biosensor membranes exhibit cracking, flaking, protein adhesion, and calcium deposits (Moussy et al., 1994). Mineralization of polymer-based membranes occurs in the biological environment, resulting in cracking and changes in permeability (Mercado and Moussy, 1998). The presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups in a polymerbased sensor membranes contributes to the polymers total interfacial energy. This energy has been shown to be important in the nucleation of calcium phosphate on the surface of such membranes. The tortuous porosity associated with polymer membranes has also been shown to be important in membrane stability and mineralization in vivo. Biological components, which enter pores or voids in the material, cause metabolic shadows, which are loci for ion and calcium accumulation. This situation, coupled with the fact that mineral deposits have been known to propagate surface fractures in polymeric membranes, presents a potentially serious problem for implantable glucose sensors.\n\nAnother urgent in vivo challenge yet to be overcome pertains to drift of the glucose sensor output with time. This phenomenon may be caused by leakage or inadequate diffusion properties, and events at the body-sensor interface such as biofouling and protein adsorption, encapsulation with fibrotic tissue, and degradation of the device material over time. Gilligan et al. (1994) reported that sensor membranes eventually failed because of biodegradation or biofouling of test bioprotective polymeric membranes. The chemistry and stability of the membrane material is therefore an important consideration in biosensor applications.\n\nThe filtration of 20-100 nm molecules, with absolute precision, is highly desirable for biosensors and other biomedical applications ranging from blood fractionation to artificial organs. Over the past 30 years, the field Fig. 3. SEM showing (a) top view of a single 50-nm pore and (b) high magnification image of 24.5-nm pore.  of membrane science and technology has developed rapidly (Lonsdale, 1992;Martin, 1994). Currently, membranes with nominal pore sizes as small as 20 nm are available. Even so, the filtration at these dimensions is far from absolute. The most common filters are polymeric membranes formed from a solvent-casting process, which result in pore size distribution with variations as large as 30% (Dunleavy, 1996). The use of ion-track etching to form membranes (e.g. Millpore Isopore) produces a much tighter pore size distribution (9 10%). However, these membranes have low porosities (B10 9 pores/cm 2 ), limited pore sizes, and the pores are randomly distributed across the surface. Porous alumina (e.g. Whatman) has also been used to achieve uniform pores. Although the aluminas typically have higher pore densities (\\ 10 10 /cm 2 ), only certain pore sizes (typically greater than 20 nm) can be achieved and the pore configurations and arrangements are difficult to control.\n\nThe technology of micromachining can be used to create membranes with a multitude of pore configurations and arrangements. For example Yang et al. (1998) used standard microfabrication techniques to create filtration membranes made of silicon nitride and parylene in 1-10 mm size range for studying the effects of pore size and shape on the passage of gases. Van Rijn et al. (1998) were able to obtain pore sizes of several hundred nanometers using interference lithography. Other research groups have recognized the need to develop novel microfabrication techniques for defining smaller nanoscale pores in membrane structures. By   using a sacrificial oxide, Kittilsland et al. (1990) were able to define a flow channels between two silicon membranes. The fabrication process gave a self-aligned membrane based on the etch-stop created by heavily boron-doping of an opened silicon substrate. While this process has many of the advantages of a simple fabrication scheme and control over pore sizes, it had problems of doping control, pore density considerations, and a tortuous flow path We have previously reported on novel microfabrication strategies to create pore sizes in the tens of nanometers on silicon substrates (Chu et al., 1996;Tu et al., 1998;Desai et al., 1999a) using a combination of photolithography and deposition/selective removal of sacrificial layers. In addition to tightly controlled pore size distributions (B 5% over a 4¦ wafer), these membranes take advantage of silicon's beneficial material properties such as biological, thermochemical, and mechanical stability. Silicon-based membranes have recently been described for bioseparation and immunoisolation applications (Ferrari et al., 1996;Desai et al., 1998Desai et al., , 1999b)). Such membranes consist of a surface-micromachined membrane on top of an anisotropically etched silicon wafer, which provides mechanical support. The nominal pore size is determined by the deposition and selective removal of a sacrificial layer, sandwiched between two structural layers (Chu et al., 1996). These membranes exhibit highly uniform pore distributions (B5% variation) and have been fabricated with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm. Using this approach, the final configurations of the membrane pores, including pore size, density, and path length, can be fabricated as desired.\n\nBuilding on our previous work in micromachined membranes, we present a novel nanopore anti-fouling silicon membrane for bioseparation and biosensing applications. Micromachined membranes may be advantageous for in vitro and in vivo applications requiring membrane biostability and non-fouling over time. The present paper describes the characterization of novel nanoporous micromachined membranes that exhibit low bio-fouling and selective diffusion in vitro, with pore sizes capable of the simultaneous exclusion of albumin and diffusion of glucose. Using membranes with pore sizes of 25.4 nm, we examine diffusion of glucose (MW 180) and albumin (MW 66K) as well as morphological changes and degradability of the membrane over time.  The next etch step is the etching of holes in the base layer, which defines the overall shape of the pores. The holes are etched through the polysilicon by chlorine plasma, with a thermally grown oxide layer used as a mask. After the pore holes are defined and etched through the base layer, the pore sacrificial oxide is grown on the base layer. The sacrificial oxide thickness determines the pore size in the final membrane, so control of this step is critical to reproducible pores in the membranes. The necessary control is accomplished by the thermal oxidation of the silicon in dry oxygen. Thermal oxidation of polysilicon allows the control of the sacrificial layer thickness of less than 0.5 nm across the entire wafer. Limitations on this control can come from local inhomogeneities in the polysilicon, such as the initial thickness of the native oxide (especially for polysilicon), the grain size or density, and the impurity concentrations.\n\nTo mechanically connect the base polysilicon with the plug polysilicon, which is necessary to maintain the pore spacing between layers, anchor points are defined in the sacrificial oxide layer. After the anchor points are etched through the sacrificial oxide, the plug polysilicon is deposited to fill in the holes. The plug layer is then planarized down to the base layer, leaving the final structure with the plug layer only in the base layer openings. Chemical mechanical polishing is used to planarize the polysilicon, leaving a very smooth surface with the pores exposed.\n\nA protective nitride layer is then deposited on the wafer (completely covering both sides of the wafer). This layer is completely impervious to the KOH chemical etch used to release the membranes from the bulk silicon. The backside etch windows are etched in the protective nitride, exposing the silicon wafer in the desired areas, and the wafer is placed in an 80°C KOH bath to etch. After the silicon is completely removed up to the membrane (as evidenced by the smooth buried etch stop layer), the protective, sacrificial, and etch stop layers are removed by etching in HF.\n\nTo assess the size of the pores fabricated on the membranes, both in situ ellipsometry and post-fabrication microscopy were used. The in situ ellipsometry was used to measure the thickness of the thermally grown sacrificial oxide on the base polysilicon layer. Because of the morphology of the features, the thickness could not be measured directly, but a polysilicon-covered dummy was used in the oxidation furnace and measured. Profiles of the oxide thickness were taken across the wafer, and random measurements around the entire wafer were taken to get a statistical average of the oxide thickness.\n\nNanoporous membranes were microfabricated with pore thickness of 24.5 nm. The fabrication of nanochannels in the membrane structure consists of two steps: (1) surface micromachining nanochannels in a thin film on the top of a silicon wafer, and (2) releasing the membrane by etching away the bulk of the silicon wafer underneath the membrane. The overall process is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The first step is the etching of the support ridge structure into the substrate (not shown in the figure). These ridges provide mechanical rigidity to the final membrane structure. A low stress silicon nitride layer (nitride), which functions as an etch-stop, is then deposited. A polysilicon film, that acts as the base structural layer (base layer), is deposited on top of the etch-stop layer. Because the etch-stop layer is very thin, the structural layer gets deposited down into the support ridge, which will remain after the membrane is released and the etch stop layer is removed.\n\nNanoporous membranes were verified to have open pores using a nitrogen flow rate test. Nitrogen flow rate tests were carried out by isolating the filters in a chamber with only one inlet and one outlet. The inlet was connected to a compressed nitrogen gas tank and held at 5 psi. The outlet was connected to a tube submerged underwater, and relative flow rates were measured by counting the rate of bubble flow there.\n\nDiffusion of glucose was measured for three types of membranes: nanopore microfabricated membranes (pore size, 0.0245 mm), Whatman Anodisc membranes (pore size, 0.02 mm), MF-Millipore Mixed cellulose acetate and nitrate membrane (pore size, 0.025 mm). All membranes were examined in vitro by measuring relative concentrations of glucose on both sides of the microfabricated interface over time, using a mini diffusion chamber constructed around the membranes. The diffusion chamber, fabricated out of acrylic, consists of two compartments A and B with fixed volumes of 2 ml, separated by the desired membrane, sealed with Orings, and screwed together.\n\nGlucose is measured on either side of the membrane using the diffusion chamber by means of a quantitative enzymatic assay (Trinder, Sigma) and colorometric reading via a spectrophotometer. Starting glucose concentration for all tests was 6666 and 0.0 mg/dl in chambers A and B, respectively. Samples of 0.1 ml were taken from the diffusion chamber and 10 ml of that were added to 3 ml of glucose reagent in a cuvette, and mixed gently by inversion. Each tube was incubated for 18 min at room temperature and then readings were taken at a wavelength of 505 nm. The reagent is linear up to 750 mg/dl. The diffusion chamber itself was attached to a motor for stirring in order to minimize boundary layer effects (diffusion resistance at the liquid/membrane interface). In order to ensure wetting of the pores, the receptor cell was first filled with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 15 min before the filling of the donor cell. The donor cell was filled with solutions of glucose in PBS in varying concentrations.\n\nAlbumin is also measured on either side of the membrane using the diffusion chamber. Albumin diffusion and/or exclusion was first measured and quantified using Albumin BCP (bromocresol purple, Sigma). Starting albumin concentration for all tests was 4 g/dl and 0.0 mg/dl in chambers A and B, respectively. A sample of 0.1 ml was taken at time zero and at the end of the diffusion period (time, 330 min). An aliquot of 300 ml was then added to 3 ml of the reagent and absorbance was read at 600 nm. Reagent plus deionized water was used as the blank. The BCP assay is linear up to 6 g/dl but is not accurate below 1 g/dl. For the small concentration of albumin that might be present in chamber B, we also measured the presence of any protein in chamber B using the Bradford Method (Mi-croProtein Kit, Sigma). This method quantitates the binding of Coomassie brilliant blue to an unknown protein and compares this binding to that of different amounts of a standard protein. Albumin was used as a standard protein. This method quantifies 1-100 mg protein using a standard curve, with sensitivity down to 10 or 0.1 g/dl protein. The absorbance is measured at 595.\n\nThe various membranes were viewed before and after diffusion tests through an Olympus epifluorescent microscope coupled with a photomicrography system. The membranes were visualized using brightfield imaging mode. The structure and pore size of microfabricated membranes was verified using scanning electron microscopy.\n\nAfter the completed fabrication, the pore sizes were measured with a SEM at high magnification and compared to the expected values from the oxide thickness measurements. Fig. 2 is a scanning electron micrograph of the entire membrane with the surrounding support structure (top view). Fig. 3 shows scanning electron micrographs obtained for a 50-nm pore and a 24.5-nm pore. For an oxide that measured 25.49 0.5 nm, a 24.590.9 nm pore size was measured. The discrepancy of the absolute value is due to the loss of some of the oxide from a quick dip in HF before the deposition of the plug polysilicon layer (calculated to remove 1.0 nm of oxide), and the error is largely due to the inability to obtain a non-distorted view of the pore edges at high magnification (Hansford, 1999).\n\nIn terms of glucose diffusion through the membranes, we see that the glucose concentration increases and begins to plateau at 240 min (Fig. 4). Comparing our diffusion rates with that of commercially available membranes, we see that microfabricated filters have glucose diffusion properties comparable to Millipore and Alumina Whatman membranes with similar pore size. Fig. 5 shows the diffusion of glucose from a pure glucose solution and a mixed solution of glucose and albumin through 24.5-nm-pore-sized silicon membranes. The presence of albumin does not seem to impede passage of glucose through the membranes, nor slow down glucose transport in the experimental conditions we employed. In contrast, the diffusion of glucose through millipore membranes from a mixed solution of albumin and glucose is significantly less than from a pure glucose solution (Fig. 6).\n\nFig. 7 shows that no detectable amounts of albumin diffuse through the microfabricated membrane. The same membrane, however, shows glucose diffusion. The microfabricated membranes seem to be able to achieve complete exclusion of albumin (to within the limits of detection), while allowing glucose diffusion.\n\nThe passage of albumin through the micromachined membrane is measured by looking at the change albumin concentration in chamber A and chamber B over time. Using the BCP assay, we found no detectable traces of albumin in chamber B. However, the amount of albumin in chamber B may have been below the limits of detectability of this assay system. Therefore, the Bradford Method was also employed. Using this microassay, we again found no detectable amounts of albumin in chamber B for the micromachined membrane but small amounts of protein in chamber B using both the millipore and whatman membranes. The amounts of albumin detected after 420 min in chamber B were approximately 0.25 and 0.20 g/dl albumin for the Millipore and Whatman membranes, respectively (Table 1).\n\nTo further verify this difference in protein concentration over time, we also looked at any changes in albumin concentration in chamber A. The change in albumin concentration can be due to either diffusion through the membrane or adsorption of the protein to the membrane. We found that nanopore micromachined membranes have almost no change in albumin concentration in chamber A over time, whereas, the other membranes had significant changes in chamber A protein concentration. This suggests that both diffusion and adsorption of albumin is negligible for micromachined membranes compared to the other membranes (Table 2).\n\nWe have compared properties and calculated the effective diffusivity for all three membranes based on the glucose diffusion studies described above. This is done using Fick's Law of diffusion, as shown below. Diffusion across the membrane can be described by,\n\nwhere N is the flux, A eff is the cross sectional pore area, D eff is the effective diffusivity, L is the membrane thickness, and C is the chamber concentration (Dunleavy, 1996;Hansford, 1999). It is assumed that (i) there were no significant boundary layer effects in the rotating diffusion chamber and (ii) a steady-state concentration profile was established within the membrane. By coupling this with the mass balance equation,\n\none can find the following relationship between concentration in chamber B and time,\n\nwhere h is volume fraction of chamber A to B (=1), C A0 and C B0 are initial solute concentrations in chamber A and B, respectively, and V B is the chamber volume (= 2 ml). By plotting,\n\nand since\n\nthe effective diffusivities of glucose for the different membranes can be determined (Table 3).\n\nAll membranes were evaluated before and after diffusion experiments to determine if any structural or surface changes had occurred. We find that there are significant changes in membrane morphology for both the Whatman and Millipore membranes after being incubated with glucose, albumin, and phosphate buffered saline for over 24 h at 37°C (Figs. 8 and 9). In contrast, the micromachined silicon membrane has the same appearance before and after the tests (Fig. 10). In fact, the microfabricated membrane pores are free from biofouling and any agglomeration of the protein on the surface. The Millipore and Whatman membranes display inhomogeneities and morphological changes after all diffusion tests.\n\nNanoporous silicon membranes were characterized in terms of glucose diffusion, albumin exclusion and stability in biologic environments. Results indicated that glucose does indeed diffuse through microfabricated membranes at a rate comparable to commercially available membranes. At the same time, albumin is excluded from passage. In mixed solution of glucose and albumin, it has been shown that only glucose diffuses through the membranes.\n\nAn increasingly important application of biofilters is that of biosensors (Gough, 1988). Ideally, the sensing membrane should provide protein-removal with high capacity and selectivity as well as compatibility with established laboratory and clinical protocols. Although several membranes, such as those by Whatman and Millipore (Gough et al., 1995), are available for sizebased filtration, these membranes do not have all the desired 'ideal' membrane properties such as stability, biocompatibility, and well-controlled permselectivity. Moreover, these membrane should allow passage of desired biomolecules without biological fouling over time.\n\nThe proposed filter technology may address and alleviate several of the problems associated with current commercially available separation membranes. As mentioned earlier, protective membranes or coatings can be used to improve signal interference in amperometric glucose sensors by providing selective permeability and decreasing non-specific adsorption. Through the use of controlled sacrificial layer deposition, membranes can be fabricated with sufficient precision to guarantee high pore uniformity in sub-micron dimensions. The thickness of the thermally grown oxide can be controlled to 91 nm for nominal pore sizes as small as 18 nm. This is the size range needed to obtain absolute protein exclusion and glucose diffusion for biosensor applications.\n\nMoreover, this filter technology can bring in the added advantages of stability, minimal protein adsorption through established silicon surface modification techniques, reusability, and sterilizability. Silicon micromachined membranes do not have the tortuous porosity associated with polymeric membranes that has been shown to decrease membrane stability and increase mineralization in vivo. Moreover, these inorganic silicon membranes do not exhibit local accumulation of mineral deposits, which may lead to the local surface fractures often present in polymeric membranes. Silicon surface chemistry does not promote mineralization, one of the biggest for polymeric biosensor membranes, even in long term in vivo implantation (Desai et al., 1995).\n\nAnother problem associated with some membrane technology is signal interference. This phenomenon may be caused by leakage or inadequate diffusion properties, and events at the body -sensor interface such as biofouling and protein adsorption, encapsulation with fibrotic tissue, and degradation of the device material over time. Gilligan et al. (1994) recently reported that sensor membranes eventually failed because of biodegradation or biofouling of test bioprotective polymeric membranes.\n\nNanoporous anti-fouling silicon membranes may hold great potential for biosensor applications due to the fact that they can be micromachined to the desired pore size, can be easily integrated onto a biosensor platform, and are biologically stable in the presence of proteins and ionic solutions. They may provide a novel alternative to conventional membrane technologies and coatings currently used for amperometric glucose sensors."
