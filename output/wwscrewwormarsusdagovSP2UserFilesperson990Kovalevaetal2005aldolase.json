    "abstract": "Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a key enzyme in glycolysis. We have characterized full-length coding sequences for aldolase genes from the cyst nematodes Heterodera glycines and Globodera rostochiensis, the first for any plant-parasitic nematode. Nucleotide homology is high (83% identity), and the respective sequences encode 40 kDa proteins with 89% amino acid identity. Genomic sequences contain six introns located at identical positions in both genes. Intron 4 in the H. glycines gene is >500 bp. Partial genomic sequences determined for seven other cyst nematode species reveal that the large fourth intron is characteristic of Heterodera but not Globodera aldolase genes. Total aldolase-like specific activity in homogenates from H. glycines was 2-fold lower than in either Caenorhabditis elegans or Panagrellus redivivus (P = 0.001). Activity in H. glycines samples was higher in juvenile stages than in adults (P = 0.003). Heterodera glycines aldolase has Km = 41 µM and is inhibited by treatment with carboxypeptidase A or sodium borohydride.",
    "full_text": "Plant-parasitic nematodes are dependent primarily upon carbohydrate metabolism for several critical life processes, and investigation of the glycolytic pathway may offer insight into development of control strategies based upon energy production. Glycolytic enzymes have been examined extensively in animal-parasitic nematodes (Komuniecki and Harris, 1995) and to a lesser extent in plant-parasitic nematodes (Barrett and Wright, 1998). A key glycolytic step responsible for the reversible cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to the triose phosphates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate is catalyzed by fructose-1,6bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13). Aldolase has been biochemically characterized in free-living (Ells, 1969;Inoue et al., 1997;Reznick and Gershon, 1977) and animal-parasitic (Kochman and Kwiatkowska, 1982;Rhodes, 1972) nematodes but not in plant-parasitic nematodes.\n\nAlthough glycolysis is one of the most extensively studied metabolic pathways, and its component enzymes have been conserved during evolution (Marsh and Lebherz, 1992), among the invertebrates fewer than 10 aldolase genes have been characterized thus far. Of these, three of the genes are from nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans, Inoue et al., 1997;Onchocerca volvulus, McCarthy et al., 2002). No aldolase gene has been described for any plant-parasitic nematode. We report here characterization of the aldolase gene from the cyst nematodes Globodera rostochiensis and Heterodera glycines, partial genomic sequences from seven other cyst nematode species, and aldolase-like activity in homogenates prepared from different developmental stages of H. glycines.\n\nNematodes: Heterodera glycines (population NL1-RHp) was reared on soybean plants according to Sardanelli and Kenworthy (1997). Globodera rostochiensis cysts were kindly provided by V. Dzhavakhiya, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, All Russian Research Institute of Phytopathology, Golitsino. The microbivorous species Caenorhabditis elegans (strain N2) and Panagrellus redivivus (population LKC26) were reared as described previously (Chitwood et al., 1995).\n\nAldolase assay: Nematodes were homogenized for enzyme assay in sterile water using a motor-driven ground glass homogenizer. The 20,000 × g supernatants were vacuum dried and dissolved in assay buffer (TEA; triethanolamine, 100 µM, pH 7.6; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and protein was estimated with the microBCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Aldolase-like activity was detected using a spectrophotometric assay modified from Rajkumar et al. (1966) and Misset and Opperdoes (1984). The reaction was started by addition of substrate (fructose 1,6-biphosphate, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and progress was monitored by decreasing absorbance at 340 nm. Reactions were performed at 37 °C, thereby providing adequate absorbance signals for measuring aldolase activity in crude nematode homogenates. One aldolase unit is defined as the amount of enzyme causing loss of 1 nMol NADH/minute, and data are expressed as units per mg protein ± SE. Inhibition of aldolase activity was tested either by digestion with carboxypeptidase A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or treatment with sodium borohydride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in assay buffer.\n\nDNA preparation: A H. glycines cDNA library constructed in bacteriophage vector Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was provided by E. L. Davis, North Carolina State University. Total cellular RNA was isolated from frozen G. rostochiensis cysts by a standard guanidinium thiocyanate method followed by cDNA preparation with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Alternatively, total RNA was con-verted to 5Ј-and 3Ј-elongated cDNA for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), with the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Genomic DNA was extracted from 100,000 fresh juveniles of H. glycines and from G. rostochiensis cysts with the MasterPure DNA purification kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI).\n\nGenomic DNA was also prepared from four other Heterodera species: H. schachtii (Belgium), H. avenae (France, Villasavary), H. ripae (Belgium), and H. litoralis (New Zealand); and from three other Globodera species: G. pallida (Germany), Globodera sp. (Peru, Huamachuco), and Globodera sp. (New Zealand). For each species, one to four cysts were used for DNA extraction as described previously (Subbotin et al., 2000).\n\nIdentification of aldolase cDNA: The PCR and sequencing procedures have been described (Kovaleva et al., 2002). The PCR primers were chosen on the basis of multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences of several known aldolase genes. Positive PCR products amplified from H. glycines cDNA were then sequenced to confirm homology to known aldolase genes, and the sequences of overlapping fragments were combined. The 5Ј-end and the 3Ј-end regions of the H. glycines aldolase gene were amplified from a cDNA library using nested PCR with M13REV and T3 sequencing oligonucleotides as sense PCR primers for the 5Ј-end, and M13-21 and T7 sequencing oligonucleotides as antisense PCR primers for the 3Ј-end, along with corresponding specific primers derived from the obtained informative sequence. Similar techniques were applied for identification of aldolase sequence from G. rostochiensis, but the 5Ј-end and the 3Ј-end regions were detected by the RACE method.\n\nIdentification of introns: Genomic fragments spanning the introns of aldolase from H. glycines and G. rostochiensis were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The precise splicing sites of the introns were identified by the alignment of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences, and by using GENSCANW (Burge and Karlin, 1998). Other gene-prediction programs used were GENWISE (Birney et al., 2004) and HMMgene (Krogh, 2000). Based on the established genomic sequences of H. glycines and G. rostochiensis aldolase genes, we designed primers to amplify fragments with predicted lengths from 850 to 1350 bp, spanning four introns. Using primers Ald-F: 5Ј-ATGGCAGAGGTCGGAAAC-3Ј and Ald-R1: 5Ј-GCTTTGTAGGTGTAGGC-3Ј, we obtained fragments of aldolase genes from other Heteroderidae. Two to three clones for each species were then sequenced using primers Ald-F and Ald-R2 (5Ј-CACGATGGGCA-CAAGTC-3Ј), and positions of introns were established.\n\nAldolase activity was detected in tissue samples prepared from immature and mature stages of H. glycines, including eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2), and females and males. The amount of activity was highest in preparations of J2 and eggs, and lowest in adults (P = 0.003). Specific activities at 100 µM substrate were 86 ± 6 units/mg protein for J2 and 69 ± 6 for eggs. Extracts of males had 50% to 60% of those activities (40 ± 17 units/mg protein), and females had <5 units/mg. Aldolase levels in C. elegans and P. redivivus were each 2-fold higher than in H. glycines (P = 0.001; 213 ± 29 and 195 ± 6 units/mg protein, respectively).\n\nIn samples prepared from J2, activity was tested with substrate concentrations varying from 12 to 200 µM, and Km was estimated at 41 ± 4 µM. Inhibition experiments at 100 µM substrate showed 50.8% loss of activity following carboxypeptidase A digestion, and 48.8% and 90.0% losses in the presence of sodium borohydride (5 mM and 10 mM, respectively).\n\nFull cDNA and genomic aldolase sequences were characterized for H. glycines and G. rostochiensis. The mRNA sequences corresponding to complete coding sequence (CDS) of aldolase were deposited into Gen-Bank under the accession numbers AF318604 (H. glycines) and AY160988 (G. rostochiensis). The predicted cyst nematode aldolases are proteins of 366 (H. glycines) and 365 (G. rostochiensis) amino acids with molecular weight ∼ 40 kDa. The glycolytic enzyme domain in both species occupies almost the entire sequence, from residue Glu-19 to the carboxy terminus. Functionally important residues were established by similarity. Arg-60 and Lys-150 bind the C-1-phosphate group of the substrate, and a catalytically important C-terminal tyrosine is essential for enhanced activity of the enzyme toward fructose bisphosphate as compared with fructose-1phosphate. Lysine-233, involved in Schiff base formation with dihydroxyacetone phosphate, is located in the aldolase signature (Ile-225 and Asn-235). Overall homology of the two amino acid sequences is 89%, and nucleotide sequence identity of the coding regions is 83%.\n\nUsing primers Ald-F and Ald-R2 (Fig. 1), partial genomic sequences were determined for H. avenae, H. litoralis, H. ripae, H. schachtii (accession numbers AY494940-3), and G. pallida, Globodera sp. Peru, Globodera sp. New Zealand (accession numbers AY497332-4). The obtained fragments corresponded to residues 14 to 177 of aldolase sequences from H. glycines and G. rostochiensis (Fig. 2). Multiple alignment of the sequences shows a high degree of homology among aldolase genes from all species (Fig. 2). Within the Heterodera group, similarity was 92% to 100% (100% identity between H. glycines and H. schachtii). Similarity within the Globodera group is 90% to 94% (highest between G. rostochiensis and G. pallida). Nucleotide sequence homologies were also very high: 86% to 98% within the Heterodera spp. (highest between H. glycines and H. schachtii) and 88% to 91% within the Globodera species (highest between G. rostochiensis and G. pallida).\n\nTwo overlapping fragments that together span the entire CDS were amplified from genomic DNA of H. glycines and G. rostochiensis and used to determine the contiguous sequences of the aldolase genes. Comparative analysis of genomic and cDNA sequence data showed that, for both cyst nematodes, the CDS was interrupted by six introns at identical amino acid positions: 42, 88, 130, 208, 270, and 337 (Fig. 1). The fourth intron in H. glycines is exceptionally large (554 bp), unlike the corresponding intron in G. rostochiensis. We examined other Heterodera and Globodera species for the presence of this large intron by using primers Ald-F and Ald-R1 (Fig. 1). The PCR results showed that all Heterodera products were 1250 to 1350 bp long whereas all Globodera products were 850 to 900 bp long (Fig. 3). Based on this difference in size we conclude that the aldolase gene in Heterodera spp. contains the large fourth intron and the Globodera spp. gene does not. All nine species have introns 1 through 4 in the same position. Introns 1 through 3 were sequenced for all species and were short (mostly 40 to 60 bp). Intron 3 was most variable in size (46 to 138 bp) and sequence. litoralis; Gpa, G. pallida; G827, Globodera sp. Peru; G582, Globodera sp. New Zealand). The alignment is viewed using GeneDoc (Nicholas et al., 1997). Positions with identical residues are labeled with white letters on a black background, positions with a consensus are white on gray, and positions without a consensus but with conserved substitutions are black on gray.\n\nDespite its importance in energy metabolism and abundant information for vertebrates, an understanding of aldolase biochemistry in plant-parasitic nematodes is lacking and will benefit from a genetic approach. Difficulties presented when attempting to work with obligate parasites in the laboratory have also limited the molecular characterization of genes from plant-parasitic nematodes. Recently, using the expressed sequence tag (EST) approach, a number of sequences have become publicly available, including those from several parasitic species. The EST database contains fragments of aldolase-like sequences from H. glycines (Gao et al., 2001), H. schachtii (CF101130), G. rostochiensis (Popeijus et al., 2000), and Meloidogyne incognita (McCarter et al., 2003). Nevertheless, aldolase genes have not been described for any plant-parasitic nematode thus far, and phylogenetic analysis of this gene across the phylum Nematoda has not yet been attempted.\n\nWe have detected and characterized aldolase genes in nine plant-parasitic nematodes, providing the first molecular analysis of this enzyme for cyst nematodes. Aldolase-like activity was detected in both immature and mature stages with substrate affinity similar to that reported for free-living and animal-parasitic nematodes (Inoue et al., 1997;Reznick and Gershon, 1977;Rhodes, 1972;Zeelon et al., 1973). Inhibition of H. glycines aldolase activity by carboxypeptidase A and sodium borohydride is consistent with the behavior of aldolases from other organisms (Blonski et al., 1997;Choi et al., 2001;Gefflaut et al., 1995). Despite similar substrate affinities, the amount of aldolase on a unit protein basis is greater in whole body homogenates prepared from free-living species than in H. glycines.\n\nWhether this is relevant to the energy requirements of these nematodes is not known.\n\nComparative studies of aldolase activity in samples prepared from different developmental stages of H. glycines showed similar activity in eggs and J2, and lower activity in adults. Aldolase activity in eggs is mostly attributable to the presence of pre-infective juveniles, which explains the similarity of aldolase activity in eggs and J2. The lower activity detected in adults compared with immature stages, although warranting further examination, is not surprising. In Turbatrix aceti, for example, age-synchronized cultures sampled periodically over a 7-week period showed a continuous decline in aldolase specific activity to 50% of initial levels (Zeelon et al., 1973).\n\nDeduced amino acid sequences for H. glycines and G. rostochiensis aldolases have notably high homology, and each contains primary structure features conserved among aldolases (Blonski et al., 1997;Choi et al., 2001). Molecular weights of 40 kDa are expected for subunits of the aldolase homotetramer. Partial genomic sequences from seven additional cyst nematode species revealed nucleotide and amino acid similarity across all species. Thus, the minimum sequence similarity among all the Heterodera and Globodera spp. is 85% (amino acid identity) and 80% (nucleotide identity). The extensive sequence conservation suggests a close phylogenetic association among cyst nematodes. The same conclusion can be reached by analysis of intron location. All six introns in the aldolase gene from H. glycines and G. rostochiensis have identical positions; the positions of the first three introns were confirmed for seven more cyst nematodes. The C. elegans aldolase genes have three (ce-2) and two (ce-1) introns. No intron information is available for the aldolase gene from O. volvulus. The position of intron 1 from H. glycines and G. rostochiensis seems most conserved, coinciding with the position of intron 2 in C. elegans ce-2. All other introns are located in different places in the cyst nematodes and C. elegans. Based upon intron characteristics, it appears that ce-2 is more similar to the cyst nematode aldolase genes than is ce-1. In addition, C. elegans Ce-2 aldolase has higher amino acid similarity to aldolase from the cyst nematodes (72%) than does Ce-1 (60%).\n\nNoting that H. glycines and G. rostochiensis aldolases are more similar (sequence identity 89%) than the two C. elegans aldolases, Ce-1 and Ce-2, are to each other (66%), we suggest that the aldolases predicted from genes described from cyst nematodes are homologous to Ce-2 aldolase from C. elegans, whereas the O. volvulus enzyme is more closely related to Ce-1 (74%) than to Ce-2 (63%). Two genes reported for C. briggsae code for the hypothetical proteins CBG09060 and CBG15316, which have high amino acid sequence similarity to Ce-2 and Ce-1 aldolases, respectively. The cyst nematode amino acid sequences reported here have the same high homology to CBG09060 that they have to Ce-2, and lower homology to CBG15316, such as they exhibit to Ce-1. Also, intron location in the gene encoding CBG09060 is the same as in ce-2, with the same similarity to cyst nematode aldolase introns. Lack of additional information on nematode aldolases does not allow further phylogenetic analysis.\n\nThe presence of the large fourth intron in Heterodera spp. and its absence from Globodera spp. provides a potentially useful molecular diagnostic marker within the cyst nematodes. High nucleotide homologies will allow construction of specific PCR primers that may be tested over a broad range of cyst nematode species for differentiation on the basis of intron sizes. Large numbers of cyst nematode species could be screened using this PCR-based assay, thus avoiding any need for DNA sequencing.\n\nLiterature Cited\n\nJournal of Nematology 37(3):292-296. 2005.© The Society of Nematologists 2005.\n\nJournal ofNematology, Volume 37, No. 3, September 2005"
