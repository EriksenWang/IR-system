This chapter lists the advances made and the motivation for this work. The following chapter presents a brief explanation of Penning traps for the new reader. In chapter three, we discuss the methods for particle (and antiparticle) detection. Chapter four explains the mechanism for trapping positrons via positronium. Chapter five shows the progress with antiproton trapping at a new facility. Chapter six contains the experiments done combining cold trapped positrons and antiprotons.\n\nA new physical mechanism for the accumulation of cold (4.2 K) positrons, orders of magnitude more efficient than previous methods, is explained and demonstrated [1]. Highly excited positronium is formed as positrons pass through a moderating tungsten crystal in a high magnetic field. This positronium is ionized by the electric field of a trapping well, which accumulates either positrons or electrons, depending on the polarity of the well. The accumulation of positrons by this method has been previously postulated [2]. The clear symmetry we observed between positron and electron accumulation established the central role of strongly magnetized Rydberg positronium.\n\nAn understanding of the positron accumulation process allowed us to make two improvements to the absolute loading rate. First, we incorporated a second moderating tungsten crystal. This dual-moderator technique improved the rate by 250%. The use of two moderators also allowed us to study the energy distribution of moderated positrons. The second gain in accumulation rate was achieved through the installation of a new 150 mCi 22 Na source replacing the 2.5 mCi source used during beginning studies. The maximum rate now observed, benefiting from both improvements, is more than 1000 times greater than the previous electronic dampening method.\n\nWe have also demonstrated the crucial role of adsorbed gas on the surface of the thin transmission moderator. The inadvertent removal of this gas layer occurred when cold positrons and antiprotons were first made to interact [2]. The role of this gas layer in the formation of positronium remains to be understood. Further work in this area may result in improved rates, if the properties of the gas layer are optimized for positronium production.\n\nTo protect this adsorbed gas layer, we installed a rotary electrode into the 4.2 K, 6\n\nT, vacuum environment of the Penning trap. This electrode separates the antiproton and positron trapping regions, keeping the antiprotons from acting on the moderators. Extended use of this rotary electrode has shown that we are now able to protect the adsorbed layer.\n\nAs part of the ATRAP collaboration, we have trapped, cooled, and stacked antiprotons from CERN's new Antiproton Decelerator (AD) for the first time. This work built upon the techniques developed by the TRAP collaboration which pioneered antiproton trapping [3,4,5,2]. Bunched 5 MeV antiprotons are ejected from the AD. Using energy degraders, we reduce a fraction of the antiprotons to under 3 keV. These antiprotons are captured in our Penning trap and cooled via collisions with electrons to sub-eV energies. We trap and combine antiprotons from multiple ejections, increasing the total number accumulated.\n\nAntiproton trapping occurs in a new Penning trap [6] designed to accumulate positrons and antiprotons. This trap is capable of capturing positrons and antiprotons in a single, cryogenic, vacuum space. The 35 electrode Penning trap has incorporated two positron-moderating crystals, a field emission point (FEP) for electron production, and an energy degrader for antiproton trapping. As this trap is able to simultaneously trap positrons and antiprotons, we were able to experiment with the particles together.\n\nOur most interesting use of our trapped antiprotons and positrons has been the demonstration of the first positron cooling of antiprotons [7]. While we have not yet observed a clear signature of cold antihydrogen, we have demonstrated the feasibility of accumulating and manipulating the cold positrons and antiprotons that are required.\n\nLooking forward to this long-term goal of antihydrogen production, we have initially investigated two recombination techniques. The first technique, three-body recombination, has been theoretically investigated by others [8,9] with more recent work investigating rates in high magnetic fields [10,11,12]. The second technique, pulsed field recombination, has been demonstrated with rubidium [13]. This scheme incorporates pulsed electric fields (ν ∼ 0.1 GHz) to trap the positron inside the Coulomb potential of the antiproton.\n\nThe eventual goal of this work is the formation of cold, trapped, antihydrogen atoms. Antihydrogen has already been made in high-energy experiments [14,15], but would be interesting if done in an environment suitable for precision measurements. Cold trapped antihydrogen would allow for many types of experiments not available antihydrogen at high energies. Two experiments involving tests of fundamental physics are the possibility of CPT violation [16] and verifying the weak equivalence principal in neutral antimatter [17].\n\nHistorically discrete symmetry invariance began with parity conservation. The parity operator (P) inverts the coordinate system producing a mirror image of the original axis. For many years physicists had believed that the laws of physics are the same in a parity inverted space. In 1956 Lee and Yang pointed out [18], \"for the weak interaction . . . parity conservation is so far only an extrapolated hypothesis unsupported by experimental evidence\" and then suggested possible experiments which would determine if parity is a conserved quantity in beta decay. An experiment was soon carried out to test this hypothesis.\n\nA sample of 60 Co was placed in a magnetic field and cooled, aligning the nuclear spins. Electrons are emitted as 60 Co decays. The parity complement experiment has the nuclear spins aligned in the opposite direction, but with the original distribution of electrons. If parity is conserved, then the electron distribution should be equal in both the direction aligned and the direction anti-aligned to the nuclear spin. In Wu's experiment [19], there was a non-symmetric distribution. This result showed that parity was not conserved in this system.\n\nReplacing the parity conservation theory, Landau proposed that the combination of P and C might indeed be conserved [20]. C, the charge conjugation operator, exchanges a particle with its antiparticle. The combined charge conjugation and parity operators would act to change a particle to its antiparticle and change the sign of its coordinates. The hope was that nature followed the same physical laws on systems and their CP counterparts.\n\nIn 1964 Cronin and Fitch investigated the decay of K 2 . K 2 is an eigenstate of CP with eigenvalue -1. Their apparatus was designed to look for transitions of K 2 into two pions. As the two pion state is also an eigenstate of CP but with eigenvalue +1, this should be a forbidden transition. To the surprise of many, observed transitions to the \"forbidden\" state [21] showed that CP is not an invariant.\n\nCurrently it is believed that CPT, where T represents time reversal, is an invariant. As finding a CPT violation would require new physics, it is difficult to speculate on the possible size of expected violations. CPT conservation requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen should have the same energy levels and therefore any difference would be important.\n\nIn addition to interesting internal energy levels, the gravitational properties of antihydrogen will be interesting to study. Einstein's theory of general relativity rests on the assumption that gravitational and inertial masses are equivalent. After many years of tests this assumption seems to hold true. Physicists, who generally look for the simplest set of laws possible, often believe that this should hold true both for matter (which has been experimentally verified) and for antimatter (for which this has never been experimentally verified in a direct manner.) Since this test only requires antimatter of some form, it might seem easier with a collection of elementary particles, e.g. positrons. Unfortunately doing gravitational measurements on charged particles is extremely difficult due to the ratio of gravitational to electric field strength. A review of the problems in performing gravitational measurements on charged particles [22] has been done and points to the extreme difficulties with controlling \"small\" electrical effects which can mask gravitational effects. It is with this in mind that antimatter gravity experiments seem more likely to produce meaningful results with neutral samples. There remain difficulties [17] to overcome, yet the possibility to perform these experiments still exists.\n\nAlthough our long-term goals still hold many interesting and difficulties to overcome, the short-term goal of cold antihydrogen seems attainable on a short-time scale. Positrons, accumulated at a high rate using the interesting new method, are trapped simultaneously with antiprotons in a new apparatus. As both particles are accumulated in a single space, their manipulations is simple and holds no new difficulties.\n\nThe ingredients of cold antihydrogen are now available and able to be combined. Hopefully, signals from cold antihydrogen will be observed soon and spectroscopy on these atoms will follow.\n\nA Penning trap is a particular combination of electric and magnetic fields which provides the ability to trap charged particles. The range of both particle number and type held in a Penning trap is amazingly large. As these traps use electromagnetic fields for containment, they have the ability to hold antimatter particles which annihilate when held with others methods. Antiprotons have even been trapped for two months without loss [23]. Examples of trapped species include a single electron [24] and 6 × 10 5 antiprotons [2]. This chapter will present an overview of the Penning trap including the electrostatics involved, particle motion, and relevant energy levels. A more complete presentation upon which this work is heavily based can be found elsewhere [25].\n\nAn ideal Penning trap consists of a electrostatic quadrupole potential aligned in a homogeneous magnetic field. A mathematical representation of the fields is\n\nwhere P n (x) is the Legendre polynomial of order n, and d is a so far undefined characteristic length.\n\nThe magnetic field can be produced with a solenoid of such dimensions as to provide an adequate interior volume and acceptable homogeneity. One way to generate the quadrupole potential is with electrodes having surfaces which are hyperboles of revolution. Figure 2-1 shows a section of a hyperbolic trap with truncated electrodes. Extra compensation electrodes [26] are often introduced in the gaps between the ring and endcap electrodes. Hyperbolic electrodes benefit from the uniformity of the quadrupole potential. Perfect hyperbolic electrodes produce the potential given in (2.1) anywhere within the electrodes. Since Penning trap experiments often need access for particles or light, other geometries have been investigated of which the open-access cylindrical trap [27] is an example. This trap is built with coaxial cylindrical electrodes. Although this type of trap does not produce a pure quadrupole potential over as large a volume, the electrode dimensions are chosen to produce a near quadrupole field within the center of the trap.\n\nAlthough all work done in this thesis used open-access cylindrical traps, it is instructive to first work out the electrostatics of the hyperbolic trap. In this way one can see the perturbations to the field in using an open-access cylindrical trap.\n\nA hyperbolic trap has electrodes which follow one of two equations. The inner surface of the ring electrode obeys\n\nwhile the endcap electrodes follow\n\nwith ρ o and z o being the shortest distances from the center to the electrodes in the radial and axial directions, respectively.\n\nIf the electrodes are biased such that V ring = -V o and V endcap = 0, which would trap positive particles when V o > 0, then the electrostatic potential inside the trap can be solved as a boundary value problem satisfying the following\n\nThe general solution in spherical coordinates, neglecting terms which do not converge at the origin, are antisymmetric in z, or have azimuthal dependence, is\n\nApplying this general solution to the given boundary conditions gives\n\nwith the following definitions\n\nSince the constant term does not trap, the trapping potential within the electrodes can be rewritten as\n\nwhich is identical to (2.1) showing that hyperbolic electrodes can be used to generate the electrostatic field of a Penning trap. (As the constant term of the potential effects the trap operation, for example when loading the trap, it can not be generally ignored.)\n\nNow that a hyperbolic trap has been presented the next step is the three electrode cylindrical trap. Because there are less degrees of freedom than that of a five electrode cylindrical trap this trap is simpler to intuitively understand. Also, all mathematical results of this trap can be used in the five electrode case after being suitably rescaled.\n\nA three electrode cylindrical trap can be seen in Fig. 2-2. One should note that this trap as drawn is in fact not an open-access trap. The reason for the inclusion of end-plates has been to simplify the mathematics and it will be shown that near the center of the trap the movement of these plates will not drastically affect the results.\n\nBiasing this trap with the same values as that of the hyperbolic trap,\n\nCross section of a cylindrical three electrode Penning trap and V endcap = 0, gives the following boundary conditions\n\nSince the boundary conditions are naturally expressed in cylindrical coordinates this trapping configuration will be solved using them. The general expansion of the electrostatic potential in cylindrical coordinates, neglecting terms which diverge at the origin, are antisymmetric in z, or have an azimuthal dependence, is\n\nwhere I n is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order n. Using the given boundary conditions gives the following expansion [28] A\n\n)\n\n20z o C 2 0.5736 0.5734 0.5734 C 4 0.01356 0.01350 0.01350 C 6 -0.04858 -0.04859 -0.04859 ρ o = .6cm z o = .512cm Table 2.1: C k values for various endcap lengths in 3 electrode cylindrical trap with\n\nwith 2L as the total axial length of the trap. Writing out the potential for completeness gives\n\nTo convert this series into spherical coordinates one simply has to equate this series with the general expansion (2.6) along the z-axis near the trap center.\n\nRewriting the cos term as a power series and using the fact that I 0 (0) = 1 gives\n\nIn order for each of these series to be equal, each term in z must be separately equal.\n\n21) Since r d 1 for particles in thermal equilibrium, only the leading C n 's will affect the results. A table of the leading C n values for different lengths of endcaps is shown in Table 2.1.\n\nIdeal open-access traps should be designed to duplicate the pure quadrupole electrostatic field of the hyperbolic trap inside the region of interest as closely as possible. Open-access traps can be made with as little as three electrodes similar to the hyperbolic traps but five electrode traps have the ability to tune out the leading term of the non-quadrupole expansion. The geometry of a five electrode or compensated open access trap can be seen in Fig. 23. The set of boundary conditions for this trap is given as\n\nwhere\n\nIn order to reuse the results from the previous subsection, the potential will be defined as\n\n26) L endcap = z e L endcap = 2z e L endcap = 10z e C 2 0.5450 0.5448 0.5448 C 4 -0.00001265 -0.00007030 -0.00007031 C 6 -0.0003413 -0.0003494 -0.0003494 z r = .096 cm z o = .585 cm z e = 1.016 cm ρ o = .600 cm V c /V o = .8810 Table 2.2: C k values for various endcap lengths in 5 electrode cylindrical trap\n\nThe solution is trivially seen to be\n\n(2.28)\n\n(2.29)\n\nAgain the potential will be included for completeness\n\nTransforming this representation to spherical coordinates gives\n\nThe numerical values are given in Table 2.2\n\nSince the potential of this trap is dominated by the quadrupole term it will be rewritten as\n\nwhere it is clearly seen that this trap produces the same type of potential as an ideal Penning trap but rescaled by a numerical factor C 2 .\n\nIn order to complete the electrostatic solutions of the ideal Penning trap the problem of a charged particle in the trap will now be solved, see Fig. 234. For simplicity the limit of infinite endcap electrodes will be used here. Although this differs in reality since finite endcap electrodes must be used the error will be seen to be small since the potential drops off exponentially in the axial direction. This calculation follows previous work [25,28] where the amount of charge induced on an electrode by a trapped particle is computed. It will be shown that this approach agrees with the previous solution.\n\nBecause of the different boundary conditions of this problem the electrostatic potential will be expanded as follows\n\n(2.34)\n\ne knz (2.35) Crossing over a layer of charge the potential is a continuous function but not its first derivative. The potentials given are continuous as required and have derivatives which must satisfy qδ(ρ) o = ∂Φ II ∂z -∂Φ I ∂z z=0 (2.36) where δ(ρ) is the 2-d delta function defined as 2π ρo 0 δ(ρ)ρ dρ = 1 (2.37)\n\nThe solution of this problem is shown in Panofsky [29] and is\n\nand k n ρ o being the n th zero of the Bessel function.\n\nThe induced surface charge density on the cylinder is\n\nwhich becomes\n\nPerforming the trivial integral over the azimuthal angle gives the linear charge density as\n\nwhich is shown in Fig. 2345.\n\nTo determine the signal induced on an arbitrary electrode, one integrates over that electrode to find the total charge induced. The axial motion of a particle is monitored via a compensation electrode therefore the induced charge produced by a particle of charge q at the origin is\n\nPerforming the integral gives Because the cylindrical cylinder is infinite in length, motion of the particle is equivalent to a change in the limits of integration. Therefore the induced signal of a charge axially displaced z a from the origin is\n\nPerforming a sum over leading terms and then integrating with the limits taken as the charge oscillates in the axial direction gives the following signal per unit charge\n\nfor small oscillations, k 0 z a 1.\n\nAs the position dependent term will be used in following sections it will be labeled as κ = dQ comp dz a = -.767 cm -1 (2.48)\n\nAs stated earlier κ can be related to an equal quantity from previous work [25,28] with the two related via κ = -\n\nFor five electrode traps of the type considered d 1 = 0.8994 and z o = 0.586 cm giving κ = -0.767 cm -1 in agreement to the results of this approach.\n\nAssuming that the charge is that of a single positron with axial oscillation fre-quency of f = 28 MHz and amplitude z = 60 µm, gives the RF signal\n\nClassically, a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field will execute circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. This motion is known as cyclotron motion and has a frequency\n\nDefining the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive z direction it is seen that the particle is bound in the x-y plane in its circular motion. A Penning trap superimposes an electric field onto this magnetic field, trapping the particle in three dimensions. The potential of the electric field is\n\nwhere C 2 = 1 for hyperbolic traps and is listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 for other geometries. Since the magnetic field does not affect the motion of the particle along its axis, the particle's axial motion is determined by the z component of the electric field whose force is\n\nThis is clearly seen to be the force producing simple harmonic motion. Solving for the motion of the particle shows its fundamental frequency to be\n\nSince the electric field must have a zero divergence the axial component of this field brings with it a radial part. Writing the radial portion of the Lorenz force equation with ρ denoting the 2-d radial position vector and k representing the axial unit vector\n\nUsing Newton's equation to determine the particles motion gives upon substitution of axial and cyclotron frequencies\n\nThis second order differential equation exhibits the contributions of two effects. The term with ω c is from the particles cyclotron motion and the term with ω z is from the electric field. From the azimuthal symmetry one might propose a circular motion of e P f mag [Hz] 2.65k 17.5k\n\nTable 2.3: Typical particle frequencies.\n\nthe following form\n\nwith the individual motions being given as\n\nUpon substituting ρ(t) into the equation of motion one finds\n\nIn the case that ω 2 c 2ω 2 z , which is the normal experimental case, the above frequencies can be approximated by the more simple\n\n)\n\nwhere the frequencies are now labeled ω m to represent the magnetron frequency and ω c for the modified cyclotron frequency. With the characteristic frequencies now defined and the individual motions described one can see how the particle moves within the fields. From the above treatment one can see that the particle's motion is a sum of three motions each with their own characteristic time scales. The sum motion is fast, ω -1 c and slow, ω -1 m , radial circular motions imposed on a moderate, ω -1 z , oscillatory axial motion which can be seen in Fig. 23456. Typical frequencies are shown in Table 2.3, with f = ω/2π.\n\nNow that the particle's motion has been investigated, the energy of the particle can be determined. The total non-relativistic energy of a particle is given by\n\n(2.63)\n\nFrom the exact forms of the energies it is seen that the cyclotron energy is nearly all kinetic, the axial energy oscillates between kinetic and potential, and the magnetron energy almost entirely potential.\n\nIt has been shown [25] that when the Penning trap particle dynamics are solved as a quantum system that each motion behaves as a quantum harmonic oscillator with the following energy levels\n\nDetermining the expectation values of the quantum states is trivial when the average energies are known. It will be assumed that both the cyclotron and axial motion are at equilibrium with a 4 K environment and that the magnetron quantum number is the same as that of the axial. The justifications of the assumptions are shown in the following subsections. Table 2.5: Typical uncoupled radiative decay times for particles\n\nParticles executing simple harmonic motion radiate their energy [29] as given by\n\nwhich is exponential decay with time constant\n\nGiven typical experimental parameters, the decay constants for each of the motions of both positrons and anti-protons are given in Table 2.5. Looking at the decay times it is clear that only positron cyclotron energy will be able to appreciatively radiate without extra coupling. This extra coupling is in fact applied and its application is explained in the following section.\n\nAs has already been shown in a previous section, a charge oscillating in a Penning trap induces currents in the electrodes. By placing a resistive element between two electrodes which are not symmetric in the particles movement, the particle will be able to dissipate power and thus cool. A drawing of the dampening mechanism is shown in Fig. 234567with the equivalent electronic circuit shown in Fig. 2345678.\n\nThe capacitance shown in Fig. 2-8 is a combination of two different effects. C 1 represents the capacitance between the electrodes. This capacitance is necessary since the induced signal must have a grounded electrode to return the current. The other capacitance C 2 is the unavoidable capacitance which comes from the placement of the inductor, L, at a distance away from the electrode; in practice this is the dominant capacitance.\n\nThe equivalent series resistance and inductance come from a single coil. This coil is normally a single metal wire wound on a form although in the case of the antiproton axial dampening coil it is fabricated from a Type-II superconductor to reduce the resistance.\n\nCombining the various passive elements in Fig. 2  and C 2 lead to a combined impedance of\n\nThe charge induced on the compensation electrode was shown in Section 2.2 to be of the form (where the constant term has been neglected as it does not contribute to power loss)\n\nTaking the square of the time derivative and averaging over the oscillation period gives\n\nSolving for z a and inserting into (2.64) gives\n\nAs the power lost in the real impedance corresponds to the time derivative of the energy, one may write\n\nCombining the energy and energy loss equations and solving gives\n\nwhere Q is defined as Q = 1 ωRC .\n\nFor the positron axial cooling circuit this gives a particle width γ ed /2π = 1.6 Hz and a cooling decay time of .10 s. For an arbitrary number of particles (2.78) can be written as [28]\n\nwhere e e and m e are the single electron (positron) charge and mass.\n\nThe last type of cooling to be discussed is sideband cooling [30]. This technique is most easily viewed in a quantum mechanical framework. As has already been discussed the energy of a particle in a Penning trap can be labeled by three quantum numbers, one for each of the characteristic motions. Table 2.3 shows that the frequencies are well separated from each other which leads to the separation of energy level intervals. and magnetron frequencies. This drive can be expressed as an operator D = â † z âm + âz â † m (2.80)\n\nwhere â † and â are the creation and annihilation operators satisfying\n\nTo find the transition probabilities to various states one simply computes the expectation value to an arbitrary set of states\n\nwhich shows that the only transitions allowed are those that involve a lowering of the axial state with the raising of the magnetron or the raising of the axial with the the lowering of the magnetron state. If the initial state,\n\nand the state will have a higher probability to transition into |n z -1, n m + 1 than |n z + 1, n m -1 . The state will continue to evolve until the transition probability of both final states are equal which clearly occurs at n z = n m . (Changing the initial state to either n z < n m or n z = n m results in the same final state as above.) Sideband cooling turns out to be an important experimental tool as it is used to bring particles into a small radial orbit. The previous sections results showed that cylindrical traps can be used as Penning traps but only over a small central volume. Large radial orbits will not have harmonic axial potentials and therefore are generally avoided.\n\nThe detection of particles in the Penning trap falls into two categories, non-destructive and destructive measurements. Non-destructive measurements rely on the AC currents induced by the oscillating particles onto the conductive electrodes of the Penning trap. Destructive measurements are based on particle annihilation signals. As the apparatus for the destructive annihilation detection was provided by other members of the ATRAP collaboration it will only be briefly summarized here.\n\nAs has been discussed in the previous chapter, trapped particles induce signals on the trap electrodes. As the signals are extremely small (10 fA / particle), large amounts of gain must be used to monitor the signals.\n\nA schematic of the RF detection circuit is shown in Fig. 3-1. The circuit is divided into three parts, the particles, the resonator, and the cold gain. The centerof-mass motion of the particles is represented by a capacitor and inductor in series. The justification of this representation is as follows. It has been previously shown in Section 2.2 that the charge induced on the compensation electrode by an axially displaced particle to be\n\nCombining this with the result [27] of the compensation potential needed to displace a particle's equilibrium position\n\ngives\n\nThis relationship between charge and voltage is that of a capacitor and therefore the particle has a capacitance of\n\nwhere the relationship κ = -d 1 2zo has been used. Similarly the inductance of the particle can be determined. Assuming that V comp = V co cos(ω z t) and Q comp = Q co cos(ω z t) and taking two time derivatives gives\n\nThis result shows that the particles behave like an inductor of inductance\n\nFor reference, a positron that has an axial oscillation of 30 MHz will have a corresponding capacitance of 5 × 10 -21 F and inductance of 6 kH.\n\nThe resonator is a RLC series circuit with a non-zero temperature, lossy inductor represented as an inductor, voltage source and resistor. The resistor is the active element of this pre-gain stage. Without this element there would be no signal as all other components are passive.\n\nThe two capacitors represent the capacitance between the signal electrode and the neighboring electrodes and the capacitance of the signal line to ground surfaces near it. The cold gain comes from a Mitsubishi MGF1100 MESFET which takes its input from a tap on the inductor. This tap point is chosen as a balance between maximum signal (tapped as shown in the figure) and minimum noise going to the particles (tap being placed at other end of inductor, thereby shorting FET noise to ground.)\n\nThe justification of representing the particles as circuit elements will be shown in a following section. The coupled buildup cavity is schematically shown in Fig. 3-2 with the two sources of capacitance combined into a single element.\n\nThe current in this circuit is\n\nThe definitions in Table 3.1 with the approximation ω ≈ ω o give\n\nThe voltage source in this schematic is the thermal voltage produced across a resistor at non-zero temperature.

Figure 3-3 shows the various components. The diagram can be separated into DC biases to bring the MGF1100 to the correct operating mode, the capacitively coupled input, the MGF1100, and an impedance matching π-net. In typical use the MGF1100 has a transconductance of\n\nand a output impedance of 10 kΩ [31]. The π-net acts to transfer the power from the high-impedance output of the MGF1100 to the low-impedance input of the following room-temperature amplifier chain. Therefore the power at the first room-temperature amplifier is given by\n\nA typical amplifier resonance can be seen in Fig. 3-4 at three different temperatures with the Q at 4 K reaching nearly 1500. frequency [MHz] 29.4 29.6 29.8 30.0 30.2 power [arb. units] 0 2 4 6 8 10 300 K 77 K 4 K Once particles are trapped in a harmonic well, the noise voltage drives the centerof-mass motion of the particles. This linking of particles and detection will \"short out\" the amplifier at the particles' frequency. By tuning the trap voltages to bring the particles into resonance with the amplifier, a \"dip\" in signal can be seen. As the particles' signal width has been shown to depend on particle number, the dip can be used as a particle counter.\n\nWith the above results for the particle's capacitance and inductance a circuit analysis of the particles interacting with the tuned circuit [32] gives a power spectrum of\n\nwhich reduces in the small number limit (Nγ z Γ) to\n\nand in the large number limit (Nγ z Γ) to two separate peaks with separation according to δω = Nγ z Γ (3.16)\n\nAn example of a large cloud which satisfies this limit is shown in Fig. 3-5 with the non-particle resonance shown as a reference.\n\nFor the small limit Fig. 3-6 shows the dip of 8 positrons. frequency -28.776 MHz [Hz] -250 -125 0 125 250 power [arb. units] 0 1 2 3 4 5 noise floor signal Figure 3-6: Eight positrons shorting out the amplifier signal\n\nAlthough working with antimatter particles in normally more difficult than matter particles there are also some advantages. One that will be mentioned here is the availability of destructive detection techniques.\n\nAntiproton annihilation occurs with many possibilities for decay products. The simplest decay that is realized is an antiproton-proton annihilation. One possible outcome is\n\nThe actual antiproton-proton decay has many decay channels but on average it can be written [33] P + P → 1.5π\n\nwhere unlikely events and gammas have not been included. Since the trapped antiprotons can annihilate on many different surfaces in the Penning trap a statistical analysis should be done based on the different materials that could trigger the annihilation and the outcomes of each material.\n\nThe antiproton annihilation detector consists of two distinct detectors. Following the path of a π + from its creation on the surface of an electrode is instructive and can be seen in Fig. 34567. As the pion travels away from the center of the Penning trap it will reach the first antiproton annihilation detector, the fiber detector. This detector is made from optical fibers which are able to change the energy loss of the traversing pion into an optical signal. This light is detected with photomultipliers. Because of the high average number of events from a single antiproton annihilation, this detector operates with a near 100% detection efficiency. This detector also detects cosmic events and suffers from some level of electrical noise which gives a noise count rate of 75 per second. In order to reduce the noise counts, the normal event from this detector is two events in coincidence (20 ns time window) from two separate layers reducing the background rate to 10 counts per second.\n\nThe other detector of antiproton annihilation is the paddle detector. This detector consists of 18 rectangular paddles arranged in concentric circles around the magnet. This detector has a 50% efficiency of detecting single antiproton annihilation. As these detectors also have high noise rates, single events in this detector are coincidences between two layers as with the fiber detector. An event in this detector is a signal in both of the two layers such the first and second layer adjacent.\n\nA further decrease in noise can be had from combining the events from the two detectors. This combined signal was known as the trigger since it could be used to start a data acquisition cycle. The trigger is the logical AND of both detectors. A complete listing of efficiencies and noise backgrounds can be seen in Table 3\n\nTrapping positrons from a radioactive source presents interesting difficulties. The list includes the short lifetime of positrons in contact with matter, the continuous emission characteristic of radioactive sources, and the initial amount of kinetic energy with which positrons are emitted. Here we report a new trapping mechanism [1] with rates of 1.4 × 10 4 e + h -1 mCi -1 , orders of magnitude greater than a previously demonstrated electronic cooling method [34] or any other method of accumulating 4.2 K positrons. This method, using a Penning trap shown in Fig. 4-1, is compatible with extreme high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures making it ideal for precision studies with antimatter. Our studies, which focused on the symmetric nature of positron and electron capture from a radioactive source, have shown and explained a new physical mechanism for accumulating cold positrons and electrons. Highly energetic positrons, from a 22 Na source, are passed through a moderating tungsten crystal. Highly excited positronium is created as slow positrons leave the crystal, followed by an associated secondary electron. The positronium continues in the direction of the strong (5.3 T) magnetic field and enters a trapping region where it is ionized by an electric field. The ionization field is arranged such that either the positron or the electron is trapped, depending on the sign of the trapping well. Equal amounts of positrons and electrons are captured, indicating the crucial role of positronium. By varying the ionization field and trapping well depth, we have been able to identify a region of the positro-nium's phase space. The positronium that we create has an initial kinetic energy around 1 eV and interparticle separation of a few µm.\n\nWe have also introduced a second tungsten crystal to give the unmoderated positrons an extra channel to eV energies. These moderated positrons are then accelerated back to the first moderator where they become bound with an electron to form positronium. This additional channel increases the accumulation rate by 250%.\n\nThe first interaction between cold antiprotons and positrons exhibited a linking between the two trapping mechanisms [2]. The apparatus was unable to accumulate positrons once antiprotons had been captured. Postulating that the antiproton beam had removed an adsorbed gas layer from the tungsten crystal used for positronium creation, the 4.2 K Penning trap was temperature cycled to 300 K. This 12 hour process restarted the positron accumulation mechanism. In order to study this problem without the use of antiprotons, we installed an optical fiber linking the 4.2 K, extreme-high vacuum, Penning trap to an external laser. Up to 4 W of laser light, directed on the thin tungsten crystal, was able to arrest the positron accumulation, as seen with antiprotons. We now understand the need for this adsorbed layer, although its specific role in positronium formation is yet to be explained. To protect this adsorbed layer, we designed and installed a rotary electrode in the apparatus designed for further antiproton and positron studies. The use of this rotary electrode has allowed us to capture positrons and antiprotons in the same apparatus without the previous linking seen before.\n\nIn order to trap positrons from a radioactive source, the source needs to be placed near the trapping region. As the placement of a radioactive source in this area both creates a hazard for experimentalists working nearby and renders annihilation particle detectors useless, the source was designed to be moved near the trapping region as needed. Thus, a system was needed to move the radioactive source to either the loading position or a shielded position. Positron experiments were done with either of two source delivery apparatus both of which will be discussed. These apparatus will be referred to as the Harvard and the CERN apparatus for reasons which will become clear. The positron mechanical system of the Harvard apparatus was first built and used at CERN for the first attempt at cold antihydrogen. After that use, which lasted only a few months, the system was then shipped to Harvard where work on understanding the positron trapping mechanism, reported here, was performed.\n\nThe CERN positron system was first partially assembled at Harvard for intermediate tests and then completed at CERN where it is still in use. This system was improved compared to the Harvard system, incorporating a laser access port, a 140 K source precooling system, and a non-vertical storage position to protect annihilation detectors from gamma radiation from the source.\n\nThe Harvard positron apparatus can be seen in Fig. 4-2 which includes the positron blockhouse. The straight blockhouse pictured above the experiment serves several purposes. The first is radiation protection. The 22 Na material that is used as the source of positrons emits harmful radiation. The design philosophy of the source container was that there should be a negligible increase in radiation compared to the natural background for people working around the experiment. With this constraint, lead shielding was needed to absorb the emitted radiation from the source. The other purposes of this straight blockhouse are the ability to hold a vacuum and once under vacuum to move the source near and away from the Penning trap region.\n\nKeeping the source under vacuum was done using mostly standard vacuum equipment but the source movement was more difficult. The source movement design was heavily constrained including the following necessities...\n\n• Source must be able to move vertically 2 m\n\n• The system must not warm up the Penning trap\n\n• The system must be robust as failures with radioactive materials may ruin an entire trapping system\n\n• Source movement must be able to accept tolerances as great at 0.5 mm A schematic drawing of this storage blockhouse is presented in Fig. 4-3. The main functional parts of the system in regard to source movement are a computer controlled stepper motor, high performance string used to position the source, string tension sensor and two position sensors. The movement of the source was done via computer control with software that continuously checks string tension and the state of the position sensors.\n\nIn addition to being able to move the source into position for trapping, the positron mechanical system must be able to inhibit and allow the beam the enter the trapping region. This is necessary as the loading rate of positrons or electrons was normally the measurement being made. This timing was accomplished via a rotatable beam shutter which allows the positron beam to enter the trapping region when open. The chopping system includes a computer controlled stepper motor with independent position detection, a rotary motion feed-through, thermally non-conductive rods to transfer the motion to the 4.2 K environment, and a metallic plate sufficiently thick to stop all the positrons which come from the source. As an independent check on the position of the beam stop, the current on this stop and on the transmission moderator were monitored with a low-noise, precision ammeter. A plot showing the opening and closing of the beam shutter can be seen in Fig. 4-4. stepper motor high performance string tension sensor position sensor radioactive source\n\nA second positron mechanical system was built for use at CERN. Because the rates of antihydrogen production depend on the number (or density) of positrons, a new 150 mCi 22 Na source was acquired which would allow for much shorter loading times.\n\n(Figure 4-5 shows the much greater number of positrons that are trapped with the larger source.) In addition to needing more shielding, this source was also larger in diameter than the previous model and therefore had to have a larger channel through the experimental apparatus. The structure of the positron blockhouse also incorporated three new features as this experiment needed to accommodate the abilities to make and detect antihydrogen. First, the source had to be shielded from below in order to keep the antiproton and positron annihilation detectors from detecting the large number of gammas which continuously come from the 22 Na source. This was accomplished by turning the source from the vertical to an angle of 45 • . This rotation allowed the radiation to be well shielded by a Elkonite block. Next, the source had to be able to be moved out of the central axis so that the source travel channel could be used to allow laser light to enter the trapping region. This was accomplished by moving the source diagonally out of the central channel. Lastly, the source needed to be precooled in order to allow the trap to remain at 4.2 K when the source is brought down. This was done with a thermal connection between the source and a liquid nitrogen reservoir while the source is in a rest position in the block house. The CERN blockhouse can be seen in Fig. 456.\n\nPositrons are produced as 22 Na undergoes a nuclear transition changing one proton into a neutron 22 11 Na → 22  10 Ne + e + + ν e This beta decay process produces positrons with a continuous distribution of kinetic energies between 0 and E o , with E o being the energy difference between the initial and final nuclei.\n\nThis distribution has been shown [35] to be of the following form\n\nwhere F + (Z, E e ) is defined as follows\n\n) is used to account for the fact that the positron is repulsed by the nucleus and therefore reduces the possibility of low energy positrons being emitted. The other terms can be identified as C being a constant which is set to normalize the distribution, Z the final atomic number of the nucleus (10 in this case), E e the positron energy and v the positron velocity. This distribution for positrons emitted from 22 Na is shown in Fig. 4567.  22 Na Not all the positrons leaving the source will arrive in the trapping region. A careful study of the losses has been done [36,32] and will only be summarized here.\n\nWith the 22 Na source in the trapping position, the magnetic field used for the Penning trap guides the positrons to move axially with their radial kinetic energy being contained in circular cyclotron orbits. The positrons coming from the source normally would have equal probability of moving either towards or away from the exit window, but a tungsten backing material in the source capsule increases the forward yield. Even so, 25-50% are moving in the opposite direction, 50% are absorbed in the source material and 33% are lost in the source capsule vacuum window. Therefore, only 21% of the positrons emerge from the source.\n\nOnce free from the source capsule, the positrons travel along the magnetic field lines towards the Penning trap. Because the radial cyclotron motion is quick compared to changes in the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the particle orbit remains fixed. This can be equivalently express as an invariance of p 2 ⊥ /B. (Depending on the position of the source, the magnetic field may increase or decrease in strength as the positron approaches the magnetic field center.) Therefore, perpendicular momentum must also increase, thereby lowering the parallel momentum. Depending on the initial momentum angle of the positron, the positron may bounce off the magnetic field. This effect is shown in Fig. 45678, where the source is raised out of the magnetic field, causing more positrons to bounce off the field, while the positron current on the chopper wheel is monitored.\n\ndistance from magnet center [cm] 0 10 20 30 40 50 tranmission coefficient 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 As the positrons travel downward, they reach a 10µm Ti vacuum window, which separates the magnet bore vacuum from the extreme high vacuum of the trap itself. This window will also introduce a loss of 34%. At this point there is a 14% efficiency of positrons reaching the trapping region or 4.6 × 10 6 e + /mCi/s.\n\nTable 4.1: Positron/electron current measurements I [pA] I [pA/mCi] I o 1.73 .540 I o 2.18 .680 i 0 -.35 -.11 i 1 -.46 -.14 i 2 -.41 -.13 i 3 -.62 -.19 Table 4.2: Positron/electron current values\n\nIn order to verify the number of positrons reaching the trapping region, current measurements were taken from the metal surfaces through which positrons pass. Since the positrons have high kinetic energies, it is possible to see effects of secondary electrons leaving surfaces. A complete picture of possible charged currents is shown in Fig. 456789.\n\nThe secondary electrons are normally emitted with low kinetic energies but can be held in the material if it is appropriately biased. Conversely, the non-moderated positrons have energies which can not be overcome at low potentials. The small number of moderated positrons produced was such that it was not possible to measure their current with the methods used here.\n\nBy biasing the various conductors which pass or block positrons, one could measure the sum of the various currents. There exists a set of algebraic equations which determine the individual currents on each surface. The complete set of equations can be seen in Table 4.1. Although it was not possible to bias all surfaces through which currents passed, there were enough constraints that all pertinent currents could be determined. The determined values of all positron and electron currents are listed in Table 4.2.\n\nInstead of biasing away all secondary electron emission, the bias can be swept over the range of energies of the electrons. In this way, the secondary electron energy distribution can be seen. For example, in Fig. 4-10 the forward electron distribution from the transmission moderator is shown. potential barrier [V] 0 5 10 15 20 forward moderator current [fA] -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 Figure 4-10: Forward electron current from transmission moderator produced when the positron beam is allowed to pass through.\n\nAs previous work on positron and electron trapping suggested that the loading mechanism occurred via field ionization of excited positronium, experiments were carried out to validate this possibility. The model was that a small percentage of high energy positrons from the radioactive source thermalized within the transmission moderator. Upon leaving the moderator surface, a thermal positron picked up an electron to form a highly excited state of positronium. As the state of the positronium is highly excited, the particles are guided by the magnetic field. Once in the trapping region, applied electric fields separate the particles. Depending upon the sign and the magnitude of the potential where the particles separate, either the positron, the electron, or neither particle could become trapped. The potential along the direction of the magnetic field used in a typical positron capture experiment can be seen in Fig. 4-11 with typical trapping rates for this well in Fig. 4-12\n\nIn order to confirm that the positron loading was due to positronium, electron trapping was investigated. The idea was that the positronium production region potential (i.e. transmission moderator) should be held constant between electron and positron accumulation, while the particle capture region should have all potentials inverted. A typical potential field used is shown in Fig. 4\n\nFigure 4-14 shows the loading rates of positrons and electrons are identically over a wide range of loading parameters, confirming the loading of both particles via the field ionization of highly excited positronium. load number 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 percentage deviation from mean positron load rate -10 -5 0 5 10  transmission moderator potenial [V] -5.0 -2.5 0.0 2.5 5.0 load rate [particle/s] 0 5 10 15 20 positron electron Figure 4-14: Loading rate dependence on transmission moderator potential showing symmetry between positron and electron trapping\n\nIn order to increase the positronium current, we have installed a reflection moderator to act on the unmoderated positron beam which passes through the transmission moderator. This second moderator creates a low-energy positron beam traveling back towards the transmission moderator. If this reflection moderator is then biased correctly, moderated positrons can reach the transmission moderator. These positrons then have another chance to bind with an electron to form positronium. Seen via the number of trapped particles, this beam does increase the amount of positronium leaving the transmission moderator. An illustration of the additional moderated positron channel can be seen in Fig. 4 loading rate [particle/s] 0 5 10 15 20 reflection moderator potential [V] -500 -250 0 250 500 750 1000 positrons electrons Although it seemed likely that the reflection moderator was improving the positron load rate through moderation, another possible mechanism exists. It is the reflection of positrons with energies below 100 eV by the potential of the reflection moderator. This channel would not depend at all on the material used as a positron mirror, only the potential applied. To determine if this indeed was the case, the electrodes which come before the reflection moderator were biased to the nominal reflection moderator bias. The potential seen in the two cases is shown in Fig. 4-17. The dramatic difference in loading rates when using the reflection moderator or a potential to reflect positrons shows that moderation does occur and is responsible for the increased loading rate. Using this second source of moderated positrons, we were able to probe the energy distribution of this beam in an indirect manner. This technique is the measurement of the loading rate associated with the particular beam. We controlled the blocking of the moderated positron beam from the reflection moderator. By varying the difference in potential between this beam and the blocking potential one measures the energy distribution of the moderated beam. A plot of the potential can be seen in Fig. 4 loading rate [e+/s] 0 5 10 15 barrier potenial [V] 95 100 105 110 moderated positron distribution [e+/eV/s] 0 1 2 3 1.3 eV\n\nBy varying the potential used to capture positrons one is actually probing the phase space of initial positronium states. Using a simple 1-dimensional model of the field ionization of positronium, one can map out a phase space that would result in a trapped positron. Although this reconstruction only limits the initial states to a range of initial conditions, this does give an idea of the initial states created. Data sets used for this purpose can be seen in Figs. T2 potential [V] -16 -12 -8 -4 0 positron load rate [e+/s] 0 5 10 15 20 Figure 4-21: T2 map. This electrode is the positron trap.

This was clearly a grave problem for the hopes of making antihydrogen in a single trapping system. Therefore, it was decided to determine the cause of this failure in order to avoid the same problem in the next generation of Penning traps. Among the possible failure mechanisms were either \"cleaning\" or \"coating\" of the positron transmission moderator by the antiproton beam. In order to investigate the \"cleaning\", an optical fiber was brought into the Penning trap. Although optical fibers routinely carry light, there were many problems to overcome as this optical fiber had to make vacuum seals both at a room temperature junction and also in a 4.2 K environment and it had to carry large amounts of power into a vacuum environment. After trying many paths, a vacuum tight optical fiber was installed with a copper finger that helped keep the fiber tip from melting as the light was pulsed through it.\n\nAs the previous work showed that cycling of the Penning trap to room temperature restored the positron loading at least on a temporary basis, it was believed that as the transmission moderator cooled it cryopumped the residual gas left in the vacuum of the Penning trap critical to the formation of positronium. When the high energy antiproton beam passed through this foil the frozen gas layer would be slightly removed. Over time this gas layer would be \"cleaned\" off. Using the installed optical fiber to direct light on this same foil, we were able to do a controlled removal of the gas layer without the expense and difficulty of using an antiproton beam.\n\nA 818 nm laser diode was chosen as the light source. Before pulsing the light on the transmission moderator, a positron loading rate curve was taken while varying the transmission moderator potential. This initial curve can be seen in Fig. 4-24.\n\nAs the light was brought in to clean the moderator the loading rate was indeed seen to diminish. This brought light to the previous failure and allowed the design of the next generation Penning trap to include a rotary electrode which would be able to block the antiproton beam from reaching the transmission moderator. Figure 4-25 shows the effect of increasing amounts of laser energy applied to the moderator and also the recovery of positron loading rate once the moderator was cycled to room temperature and back to 4.2 K.\n\nThe positron moderators used are tungsten single crystals. The moderators are treated in order to free them of impurities using a recipe that was developed elsewhere [37], but slightly modified. The moderator is suspended by thermally isolating, thin, tungsten wires in a vacuum chamber. An ordinary light bulb filament is placed next to the moderator and is used to produce an electron source which heats the moderator. In order to direct the electrons, the moderator is biased to 1 kV above the filament and a 150 gauss magnetic field is applied to focus the electron beam.

The vacuum chamber is evacuated to better than 0.2 µTorr and the filament slowly warmed. As the moderator heats, outgassing effects are seen, probably both from the moderator itself and the surrounding vacuum chamber. At temperatures above 1500 K, the moderator temperature is measured with a optical pyrometer. The treatment cycle employed, involved two alternating steps. The first was to inject oxygen into the chamber until a pressure of 1 µTorr was achieved, keeping the moderator at 1500 K. This was done for 30 minutes such that any surface contaminants would react with the oxygen, thereby forming an oxide layer. The next step was to stop the oxygen flow and hold the moderator at 2500 K for five minutes. This step serves two purposes, removing the oxide layer which would then be pumped away and allowing contaminants to move from the bulk to the surface where their concentration is now lower. The two steps were iterated five times. A schematic of the setup is shown in Fig. 4 Chapter 5\n\nFor antihydrogen experiments, the availability of antiprotons are essential and great lengths are taken to capture these particles. We have now shown that we can trap, cool, and stack antiprotons from the new Antiproton Decelerator (AD) facility. We accumulate these antiprotons in an extreme-high vacuum, 4.2 K, Penning trap. The antiprotons are created through high-energy collisions, then cooled by the AD, and pulsed to our experimental area. This chapter will discuss how we are able to capture these particles and our techniques to cool and stack them. This work builds upon techniques pioneered by the TRAP collaboration [3,4,5,2].\n\nIn 1997, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) approved the construction of the AD. This new machine was to replace the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) which had shut down at the end of 1996. The AD was designed to reduce the operational costs of delivering low energy antiprotons. The design goals [38] for the AD were 1.2 × 10 7 , 100 MeV/c, antiprotons delivered in 200 -500 ns pulses with a 60 s cycle time.\n\nTo supply the AD, antiprotons are produced via collisions of 10 13 , 26 GeV/c protons on an iridium target. Once produced, about 5×10 7 antiprotons are collected into the AD with a momentum of 3.57 GeV/c. As the antiprotons circulate in the AD, two different cooling schemes are applied. Stochastic cooling is used on the antiprotons at 3.57 GeV/c and 2 GeV/c and then electron cooling at 300 MeV/c and then again at 100 MeV/c. After cooling, a nominal bunch of 2 × 10 7 antiprotons are ejected to the experimental extraction lines. The AD facility can be seen in Fig. 5-1.\n\nIn July 2000, the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) began delivering low-energy antiprotons [39] to the ATRAP experiment. On July 18, the ATRAP collaboration trapped antiprotons coming from the AD for the first time. Fig. 5-2 shows the annihilation signal from these first trapped antiprotons. By the end of that day, antiprotons had also been cooled down to eV levels from their initial keV energies via interactions with cold (4.2 K) trapped electrons. We have since repeatedly demonstrated accumulation and electron cooling of antiprotons. We trap up to 12,000 antiprotons per 110 second AD cycle with cooling to sub-eV energies.\n\nInjection Line to AD scintillator counts 0 100 200 300 400 release time [ms] -25 0 25 50 75 Figure 5-2: First trapped antiprotons at the AD.

Once the particles leave the AD extraction line, the beam intensity and position are nondestructively measured. The beam then passes through a gas cell reducing their energy by a small, but tunable amount. Finally, the antiprotons pass through two vacuum windows and an energy degrader, thereby entering the trapping region. Once inside the trap (see Fig 5-3), a time synchronized potential is quickly applied, trapping the antiprotons. A thorough understanding of each of the steps mentioned is crucial to the trapping of antiprotons.\n\nThe AD extraction line is the link between the AD ring and the experimental areas. This vacuum line bring the antiprotons to the experimental areas, and also steers and focuses the beam. Some of these magnetic elements are represented in Fig. 5-4.\n\nIn addition to steering the beam for a particular experiment, the beam elements guide the beam between the experiments in the AD. There are three particular magnetic elements used to do this.\n\nA typical antiproton run begins with switching the beam elements to allow the beam into the ATRAP experimental area, setting all the necessary magnets to the previous optimum settings and steering the beam. This process consumes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the beam position fluctuations and the time since the previous run. Typical magnet settings can be seen in Table 5.1, where the tuning parameter is the characteristic change in magnet current needed to move or focus the beam. In order to minimize the beam steering time, a procedure was developed to quickly steer and focus the beam [40] which will only be outlined here. DE0.QN60 DE3.BVT10 DE3. MWPC17 DE3. QN20 DE3. BVT25  display a beam profile as seen in Fig. 567. A schematic representation of the PPAC electronic system is shown in Fig. 5678. The sum of all the PPAC detector channels is an indicator of the amount of beam entering the trapping region. Plotting this sum against the number of trapped antiprotons, see Fig. 56789, shows that the PPAC can act as a normalizing detector, indicating the number of antiprotons trapped from any particular AD pulse.\n\nThe antiprotons leaving the AD are cooled to a momentum of 100 MeV/c, which is a kinetic energy of 5.3 MeV. Since trapping charged particles requires voltages greater than the incoming energy, the trapping of these particles would require 5.3 MV if no slowing process were to take place. It is possible to slow down the antiprotons such that more manageable trapping voltages are used. The slowing of the particles takes place in two steps.\n\nFirst, the antiproton beam passes through an adjustable gas mixture of helium and sulfur hexafluoride. The ratio of the two gases is variable and the the mass flows are controlled such that the total pressure of the cell is kept at one atmosphere. The total mass seen by the beam can be adjusted by more than a factor of 35 with a corresponding energy loss of 0.02 to 0.68 MeV. Since the incoming beam has a energy centered around 5.3 MeV, this loss is only a fine tuning and a more substantial loss must accompany it for trapping to occur.\n\nAfter losing energy in the gas cell, the antiproton beam enters the trap enclosure and passes through a thin foil. (The beam actually passes through other materials. A review of these energy losses can be found elsewhere [41] and will not be mentioned SRS DG535 External Trigger Gate LeCroy 2249W iADC Signal PC GPIB x10 PPAC DC Power Supply Bias ) This thin foil, referred to as the degrader, is a 125 µm thick beryllium crystal. The thickness of this foil is chosen such that a maximum number of antiprotons are slowed below the trapping voltage. If the foil is too thin, the antiprotons will emerge with enough energy that they will not be trapped by the keV voltages used to trap the particles. Conversely, if the foil is too thick, the antiprotons will stop within the degrader and annihilate.\n\nNow that the antiprotons have entered the Penning trap, and a fraction, typically 5 × 10 -4 , have been slowed to kinetic energies on the order of keV, the particles are ready to be trapped. Trapping occurs when a time synchronized pulse closes the axial potential well, which is initially open on one end to allow the antiprotons to enter. A diagram of these events is shown in Fig. 5678910.\n\nAs the antiproton beam is delivered in a single pulse of only a few hundred nanoseconds every two minutes, the timing of their capture is crucial. This section presents a overview of the electronics used to control the antiproton capture timing. Figure 5-11 shows the most important devices which control the timing, while Fig. 5-12 shows a timing sequence.\n\nThe AD forewarning pulse, which arrives one second before the antiproton beam, turns on the HTS high voltage switch and inhibits the scintillation detectors. The HTS switch is used to quickly change the degrader from a positive voltage (trap open) to a negative voltage (trap closed). Because it produces RF noise, it is kept off as much as possible. The scintillation detector inhibit only functions for a few seconds, at which point the detectors come back on-line. Next, the AD warning pulse arrives triggering a delayed pulse which then triggers the HTS switch to close, trapping the antiprotons antiprotons axial distance on-axis potential HV electrode degrader time Forewarning Signal HTS Power Warning Signal Trap/Release Detector Inhibit Detector Counters Trap Delay Figure 5-12: Schematic of antiproton trap and release timing incoming antiprotons.\n\nSignals derived from the AD warning pulse include a gate used by the PPAC integrating ADCs. The warning pulse also triggers a delayed pulse which is used for the release of the uncooled trapped antiprotons. This delayed pulse triggers the HTS switch to slowly bring the degrader voltage to a positive value.\n\nAs the HTS switch plays a critical role in antiproton trapping, it will be discussed in further detail. A schematic is shown in Fig. 5-13. The switch has three states. The first is the one pictured in Fig 5 -13, with both switches open. Because the positive bias supply is removed from the circuit, the degrader is held steady at the negative trapping supply potential, as needed to keep antiprotons in the Penning trap. In order to analyze the energy of these antiprotons, one would like to slowly ramp the voltage from the negative trapping supply voltage to a positive value (see Fig. 567891011121314.) This is done by switching the reed relay to the closed position. Because of the 10 ms filter immediately following the reed relay this switching follows the function\n\nThe reed relay is only closed when either a high voltage ramp or a setup of the HTS switch box has been called. Therefore once the high voltage ramp trigger goes to the off state, the reed relay will re-open sending the degrader back to the trapping supply voltage.\n\nIn order to prepare the Penning trap for antiproton trapping, a setup signal closes the reed relay. Once the antiprotons have entered the trap, a trigger is sent to close time [ms] 0 10 20 30 40 degrader voltage [kV] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 The switching of the degrader to the negative trapping voltage must happen quickly but it must also happen at an accurate time after the antiprotons have entered the trap. The AD provides the experiment with a warning pulse at a fixed time before the beam is to be extracted. This pulse is used to trigger a delayed pulse which triggers the HTS switch box. As expected, varying this delay changes the number of trapped antiprotons which can be seen in Fig. 5-16.\n\nAs it is experimentally difficult to change the thickness of the cold degrader in the trap enclosure, the variable gas cell is used for fine tuning the final particle energy distribution. This tuning varies the trapping efficiency as shown in Fig. 567891011121314151617. When tuning the gas cell the total pressure of the cell is held constant at one atmosphere while the relative ratio of SF 6 to He is changed.\n\nAlthough the peak of the energy tuning curve was never seen to move, it is possible that the ability to tune the energy curve could provide the ability to \"tune out\" any frozen gas layers that can freeze onto any of the vacuum windows of the trap system. percent sulphur hexaflouride in energy tune cell 0 20 40 60 80 100 normalized number of trapped antiprotons 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 Figure 5-17: Efficiency of antiproton trapping as a function of SF 6 ratio\n\nOnce antiprotons have been trapped it is necessary to confirm they are indeed there. One method is to slowly bring the degrader from its negative trapping voltage to a positive bias. In order to synchronize the changing voltage with the signals seen on the scintillation detectors, a common clock is used. When the dumping sequence is to begin, a signal is sent to begin a clock signal. This clock starts the single channel scalers used to look at various logic combinations of the detectors. After a defined delay, the HTS switch box is triggered to switch the degrader to a positive bias while an oscilloscope records the voltage on the degrader through a slow monitor. As the degrader voltage and detectors signal are measured as functions of time, they can be combined to produce a single display of particle energy as seen in Fig. 5\n\nThe antiprotons cool to eV energies via collisions with electrons. The electrons are preloaded into single or multiple wells in the Penning trap, before the antiprotons are caught. These electrons cool quickly into equilibrium with the 4 K environment via cyclotron radiation. Once the antiprotons are trapped in the long well between the HV and degrader electrodes, they have repeated collisions with the electrons. As an antiproton collides with an electron, the antiproton will have a small energy loss and the electron, although heated, will radiate away its energy. After multiple collisions the antiprotons will cool into the electron wells. With multiple wells and 100 s cooling times, near 100% cooling efficiencies are routinely seen. After cooling, the degrader is brought down from its initial voltage to release any antiprotons which have not been cooled down into one of the trapping wells. The few particles which remain (approximatively 1%) have very low energies compared to the initial distribution as seen in Fig. 5-19. trap depth [V] -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 number of trapped antiprotons 0 500 1000 1500 without electrons with electrons Since it was normal to trap the antiprotons in multiple wells the next step was to combine the particles into one well. This is done using slow changes in the well structure to move the particles axially. This process was previously developed [32] and implemented without change. Once the particles were combined, the well could then be slowly shallowed down to release the particles. In this way, we could determine the energy distribution of the trapped cooled antiprotons as illustrated in Fig. 5-20.\n\nAfter the antiprotons have been cooled and combined, the cooling electrons are ejected. The goal of many antiproton experiments was the combination with positrons, therefore the presence of electrons could not be tolerated. In practice two different ejection procedures were used.\n\nThe first technique was the pulsing open of the trapping well long enough to allow the electrons to escape but not the antiprotons. A typical well structure is shown in Fig. 5-21. As the velocity of electrons is approximatively 40 times greater at the same temperature, electrons can escape from a well before antiprotons are able to leave.\n\nThe second technique is used when the antiprotons are to be injected into a long well. The initial well structure can be seen in Fig. 5 axial position [cm] 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 voltage [V] -5.0 -2.5 0.0 2.5 5.0 T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 EET As the electrons will move faster than antiprotons, they will leave the trap and be collected further away. When the antiprotons reach the midway point between the T3 and T8 electrodes, the T3 electrode is brought back to keep the antiprotons trapped. As the antiprotons reach T3, T8 is pulsed back trapping only the antiprotons in the long well.\n\nDuring the four month long, year 2000 beam run we began trapping, cooling, and stacking antiprotons. As antiprotons are only available during such a short period, we decided to push forward the antiproton/positron interaction experiments. We performed initial studies into both three-body recombination and pulsed-field recombination techniques. During the last night of the year 2000 beam, we focused on positron cooling of antiprotons and saw cooling [7].\n\nMaking antihydrogen requires combining a single positron with a single antiproton into a bound state. Although this is made easier by the opposite charges of the particles, there is still the problem of removing energy. If two particles are initially not bound, the total energy of the system is positive and it is not possible for them to bind together without additional means. Two particular methods which we initially investaged for removing the \"extra\" energy will be discussed here. Three-body recombination relies on a third particle to carry away energy and momentum leaving a bound antihydrogen atom. As a first step, we have demonstrated the first cooling of antiprotons with positrons in a configuration compatible with three-body recombination. A second method is the use of an external field to allow a positron to enter near an antiproton. Once the positron is deep in the potential well of the antiproton the field is removed, thereby binding the particles together. This pulsed-field recombination [42] has been shown to work on other systems and we began initial exploration of this method, demonstrating that we could do the nanosecond pulsing that is required.\n\nThree-body recombination of antihydrogen can be written as P + e + + e + → H * + e + The antiproton and a positron become bound to form an antihydrogen atom while the other positron carries away the excess energy and momentum. Calculations for the matter version of this process [8,9], with a correction for strong magnetic fields [10,11,12], give a recombination rate per antiproton of Γ = 6 × 10 -13 4.2\n\nwhere T is the positron temperature in Kelvin and n e is the positron density in cm -3 . Assuming a positron temperature of 4.2 K and a density of 10 7 gives a recombination rate of 50 H s -1 . Antihydrogen must either be formed or deexcited to a tightly bound state so that it is not ionized by the electric fields which are needed to create the nested well. A study [12] has shown that this can indeed be the case for a sufficiently long interaction region.\n\nA first step towards three body recombination is the injection of antiprotons into the long well represented in Fig. 6-1. The antiprotons should remain trapped in the well with their original injection energies. After the antiprotons are loaded into the long well, it is slowly opened on one side to energy analyze exiting particles. (Antiprotons are placed into the long well by the quick pulsing (< 10 ns) of one side of the initial contament well.) A spectrum of antiprotons ejected from the long well can be seen in Fig. 6-2. antiproton energy [eV] 6 4 2 0 -2 number of antiprotons 0 250 500 750 1000 Figure 6-2: Energy distribution of antiprotons injected into the long well of Fig. 6-1.\n\nThe energy distribution of the antiprotons is low compared to what is expected. One effect which needs to be taken into account is the spread in energy of the antiprotons as they are launched. Assuming the antiprotons had up to 1 eV of axial energy, they would fall in energy as the well was opened. This concept is shown in Fig. 6-3. As the ac pulsing to open the well may have large amounts of \"line ringing\", there is some uncertainty in the initial distribution of injected antiprotons.\n\nThe other factor which should be considered is the energy loss as one potential is slowly ramped. The antiprotons oscillate in the long well and therefore sample the time-varying potential. Figure 6-4 shows a 1-dimensional simulation of the energy loss in this process as one end is linearly ramped down slowly compared to the particle movement time. Using the conditions of this experiment, a 3 eV antiproton (energy measured from 0 V potential of the long-well) would experience an energy loss of approximatively 7% (which has been taken in account for Fig. 6 initial particle energy [eV] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 final particle energy [eV] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 6-4: Adiabatic cooling of an antiproton in the long well of Fig. 6-1.\n\nThis numerical simulation shows the cooling effect of particles in a long well as one of the ends is slowly ramped down. The simulation was performed using a well of the T3 and T8 electrodes with 1 V applied to each electrode. (Applying 1 V to a single electrode produces a voltage of 0.8 V in the center of the trap, limiting the maximum energy particle able to be trapped.)\n\nAnother data set was taken to understand the apparent energy loss of the antiprotons. In this experiment, the antiprotons were raised higher in energy to measure the variation of loss with initial energy. This data can be seen in Fig. 6-5. It is interesting to note that the antiprotons are seen to be raised in energy compared to the previous experiment. In fact the energy width with respect to the expected minimum energy point seems to be consistent in the two cases. It is assumed that after careful studies are performed, this initial energy distribution of the antiprotons will be measured. As time limits did not permit this before, it will remain as an invitation to following researchers.\n\nUsing a nested Penning trap configuration, antiprotons were shown to cool via interactions with positrons. This was seen when the antiprotons which nominally remain at their initial injection energy in the absence of positrons, were cooled when the two species were combined.\n\nA plot of the on-axis potential of a nested well is shown in Fig. 6-6. In this configuration, positrons (when used) are placed in a single electrode well at T6. The antiprotons are then injected in a larger nested well (consisting of five electrodes in this case) with an energy higher than that of the positrons. As the antiprotons oscillate through the positron cloud, they transfer energy to the positrons which are kept in thermal equilibrium with the 4 K environment via cyclotron radiation.\n\nAfter a variable interaction time, the nested well is opened on one end and the antiproton energy distribution is measured. Because of experimental constraints, the cooled antiprotons which become trapped on the other half of the nested well were not measured as a function of energy. The number of antiprotons trapped on the far side were approximately 65% of the energy analyzed total. Data showing the effect of interaction time is shown in Fig. 6-7\n\nAs the positrons seem to be cooling the antiprotons to nearly zero axial energy, the effect of changing the positron well depth was investigated. A plot of the potential of a deeper well is shown in Fig. 678where the positron well depth is now an applied 5 V compared to 3 V used before.\n\nAntiprotons were then injected into a nested well with a 3 V and then a 5 V positron well while the interaction time was fixed at 40 s. Figure 6-9 clearly shows that the antiproton final energy depends on the depth of the positron well.\n\nPulsed field recombination is a technique to combine a negative ion (antiproton) and an electron (positron) using a time-dependent external electric field to form a bound atom (anti-atom). Looking at Fig. 6-10, one can see that applying an external electric field reduces the potential energy on one side of the antiproton, allowing a particle to enter closer to the nucleus. If the external field is switched off while the particle is in the newly accessible region, then it may be trapped. The trapping depends on the particle's kinetic energy and radial position.\n\nImplementing pulsed field recombination requires the opening of the potential well as above and also the ability to move the two species of particles together. Penning traps are well suited for both these requirements. The sequence of steps used can be seen in Fig. 6-11. number of antiprotons antiproton energy [eV] 0 2 4 6 8 10 (a) (b) (c) axial position [cm] 12 16 20 24 on-axis potential [V] -15 -10 -5 0 5 T1 T2 T4 T3 T8 T7 T5 T6 PR RL ER EE PE e + P Figure 6-8: Electrostatic potential of nested well for combining antiprotons and positrons with deep positron well 0 100 200 300 400 antiproton energy [eV] 0 2 4 6 8 10 number of antiprotons 0 100 200 300 (a) (b)\n\nBecause pulsed field recombination relies on the accurate timing and positioning of particles, experiments were carried out with electrons to show that the needed accuracy could be achieved. The goal was to pulse electrons from one electrode, bounce them off a repulsive electric field and then recatch them on their return. The electrons are originally trapped using an offset well which requires only one voltage pulse to release the particles. Once the trapping field is pulsed down (shown in Fig. 6-12 as a dotted line), the particles travel along the trap axis towards the far end of the trap. As they approach the electrodes biased to stop the particles, the electrons return back towards their original location. By changing the pulse duration the particles can be seen to execute from 0 to 3 trips as shown in Fig. 6-13. Special care had to be taken in the implementation of this experiment as pulse rise and fall times must be kept short compared to the particle travel time. Typical values seen for pulse rise and fall times range from 5 to 10 ns when measured at the 4 K electrical feedthroughs close to the electrodes.\n\nAs the electron pulsing experiments were successful, the next step towards pulsed field recombination was tried. This experiment involved the pulsing, stopping, and catching of positrons. The technique used was similar to that of the electron pulsing experiments except that the particles were caught after a single pass. A drawing of the various steps can be seen in Fig. 6-14. As the particles round trip time had already been verified with electrons the experiment was attempted with a pulse duration of 90 ns. Up to 3.3 × 10 5 positrons were pulsed from the T2 offset well and caught on the T8 electrode with 100% efficiency.\n\non-axis potential [V] 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 EET axial position [cm] 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 0 2 4 6 e + e + P P P e + H (a) (b) (c)  pulse length [ns] 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 catching efficiency [%] 0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nAs the positron techniques had been shown to work, the last remaining step towards pulsed field recombination of antihydrogen was the manipulation of antiprotons. This step involves the pulsing of the trapping potential used to confine the antiprotons (seen in Fig. 6-11.) Once the antiprotons are placed in a single electrode well, the electrode and an adjoining one are pulsed up to create an electric field that can stop positrons pulsed out of a elevated potential well. This nominal 3 V/cm electric field does accelerate the antiprotons, but as the time needed to stop the positrons is short compared to the time needed to move the much more massive antiprotons, the antiprotons do not move appreciably during this sequence. Once the positrons are stopped, the 3 V/cm field is brought down to 200 mV/cm which acts to separate charged particles from the recombination region. During this antiproton manipulation, all the antiprotons left the trap after about 3µs. An analog detector signal of this escape can be seen in Fig. 6-15.\n\nOne hypothesis for the antiproton loss is the axial exit of the particles. Antiprotons in the initial trap well have axial oscillation frequencies below 1 MHz or periods longer than 1 µs. Pulses applied to the antiprotons which are quick compared to this time scale will not change their kinetic energies. As the pulsing which is used for pulse field recombination have rise and fall times below 10 ns, the antiprotons should not be axially heated. Given an exit time of 3 µs, the antiprotons must have a kinetic energy of over 5 eV before pulsing. As this has not been seen in other energy analysis of the antiprotons, axial escape seems improbable.\n\nAnother possible channel for antiproton loss would be radial expansion as the particles are pulsed into a longer well. The long well that antiprotons are injected into has a long electric field free region. As the particles sample this region they probe the trap imperfections, either mechanical or electrical. It is thought that as the particle energies are of the same order as the energy perturbations caused by the imperfections that instabilities will occur.\n\nIn order to inhibit the loss of antiprotons slight variations on the pulsed field recombination scheme were tried. One of the first ideas was to place voltage barriers around the antiproton region. These barriers would not interfere with the initial recombination area but would help to keep the antiprotons from leaking out radially by providing an electric field. This scheme can be seen in Fig. 678910111213141516. With these barriers 50% of the initial antiprotons were kept in the trap. Because of the excessive loss, trying to detect antihydrogen with this sequence would be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, positrons were combined with antiprotons in a slightly modified way (see Fig. 6-17.) Both of these experiments did not show massive fast losses (which are detected on an analog channel of the annihilation particle detectors) but using positrons our yield of antiprotons kept in the long well was reduced to 25%. Although this was different than expected, the difficulty of detecting antihydrogen with this background loss made this scheme unworkable so far. -10 -5 0 5 10 on-axis potential [V] -10 -5 0 5 T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 EET axial position [cm] 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 -10 -5 0 5 e + P e + P P e +\n\nThis work has presented the progress made in accumulating and manipulating the ingredients of cold antihydrogen. We presented and explained a new technique for positron accumulation, simultaneously accumulated cold positrons and antiprotons at the new AD facility, and made these particles interact at low temperatures.\n\nA new positron accumulation technique, compatible with extreme-high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures, has been described and demonstrated [1]. This mechanism is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous methods. Positrons emitted from a radioactive source are passed through a tungsten crystal. Positronium is formed as positrons, moderated by the tungsten crystal, exit the moderator in a high magnetic field accompanied by a secondary electron. This highly-excited positronium is ionized by the electric field of a trapping well. This technique can be used to accumulate symmetric numbers of positrons or electrons.\n\nWe have incorporated dual tungsten crystals to increase positron accumulation rates by 250%. The second crystal, used as a moderator, supplies slow positrons for positronium production. Additionally, this second moderator has allowed us to study the energy distribution of the moderated positron beam. A new 150 mCi 22 Na source has been installed, increasing positron loading rates. The maximum rate observed is 1.4 × 10 4 e + h -1 mCi -1 .\n\nIn the first interaction of cold antiprotons and positrons [2], the introduction of the antiproton beam into the Penning trap arrested the positron loading mechanism. The understanding of this effect, the removal of a gas layer on the positronium production surface, along with the preventive measures taken (the addition of a valve to block the antiproton beam) have allowed us to demonstrate the simultaneous accumulation of cold positrons and antiprotons.\n\nBecause of new demands including a rotary electrode, fiber detector, additional positron moderator, and larger radioactive source, a completely new Penning trap and support apparatus had to be built. This system has been shown to be robust in capturing electrons, positrons and antiprotons over the two years it has been in use.\n\nThe antiproton experiments done with the new apparatus at the new AD facility include the capture, cooling, and stacking of antiprotons. The antiprotons are ejected from the AD at 5 MeV, passed through an energy degrader and then cooled down to sub-eV energies via collisions with cold (4.2 K) electrons.\n\n4: Equilibrium particle energies and quantum numbers\n\nSolving for the energy of each motion gives\n\nFigure 3-7: π + path from creation on an electrode.
