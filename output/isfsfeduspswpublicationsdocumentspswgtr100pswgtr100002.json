Martin 2\n\nThe growth and well being of hardwoods, as with any other organism, are dependent on the total environment. Many of the factors affecting the hardwoods are considered normal elements in their environment, contributing to their productivity. Other factors are generally considered to be damaging to hardwoods. These agents would usually include diseases, insects, and fire.\n\nThe specific term used tends to indicate the role the agent has. When we use the term disease or pathogen, the indication is that there is damage being done to the plant. Since disease may be any condition of the plant not considered normal and the pathogen as the causative agent, both these terms imply something harmful to the plant. Unfortunately, there is not a general term which might include all the agents which will affect the hardwood, at one level being beneficial, or at least not harmful, but at some other level causing injury to the plant. The pathogens may be, at some level of occurrence, microorganisms, nutrients, weather, or many kinds of macroorganisms. Arthropods include the insects, which are often considered to be injurious to hardwoods. While it is true that some arthropods may be harmful, most contribute to the well-being of hardwoods, even to the extent of controlling damaging arthropods.\n\nFire is another agent often looked upon as being damaging to hardwoods. True, fire may kill or damage hardwoods and may make trees more susceptible to arthropods or pathogens. Fire may also be important in providing the conditions for regeneration and growth of hardwoods. Thus fire, as with other agents, may be either harmful or beneficial, depending on the timing and nature of its occurrence.\n\nThe papers in this section cover the effects of diseases, insects, and fire on hardwoods. Most of these do not cover more than the effects of a single agent, as most of our research is funded and conducted in this manner. We should keep in mind, however, that there is often interaction among the agents which affect hardwood well-being. In the future, hopefully there will be more research which deals with the interaction of two or more agents as they affect hardwoods.\n\nRobert E. Martin 2 When talking of a hardwood, we generally talk of it in a holistic sense, as though it is an amalgamated mass of protoplasm, all having the same characteristics. Yet we know that the plant has many different organs, may be in various physiological aor [sic] phenological states, and may be at various stages of growth. Thus, talking about the effects of agents on a hardwood, we must be specific about the plant as well as the agent affecting it.\n\nInteraction among agents which affect hardwoods, as well as other plants and animals often influence the total effect of the complex. The total effect can be enhanced in a synergistic way or reduced by the antagonistic interaction among agents.\n\nWe can look at the way in which the interaction proceeds when one agent is considered as the intiating [sic] agent, and consider various paths which might develop from the action. What readily becomes obvious is that we have little information on the progress of the interactions. It is also difficult to sort out the \"normal\" elements of the plant habitat or environment from those which are causing a problem for the plant.\n\nThroughout most of the paper, I'll discuss some potentials for interaction among agents affecting hardwoods. Where feasible, specific agents and interactions will be mentioned. We must realize, however, that many of the situations are hypothetical. The main purpose of this paper is thus to be sure, as we proceed through the meeting that you are considering the possible interactions that might be occurring. Also, you should be considering that we can Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA.

In addition to affecting the vascular plants, the agents interact with each other, either enhancing or mitigating the influence on the overall biotic community. The agents may be biotic, such as insects, diseases, or herbivores, or abiotic, such as various components of the weather, the physical elements of the site, or fire. The purpose of this paper is to look at some of the possible interrelationships among the agents and the sum of their effects on hardwoods. depict here only a small number of the interactions that are possible or plausible.\n\nFirst, let's look at the plant and the many agents which can affect it's well being.\n\nConsidering the plant at the center, since we are centering our attention on it, we can place it at the center and surround it with the various agents (fig. 1). Ordinarily, we might not consider the need to protect the plant from some of these, but any can be injurious or fatal to the plant.\n\nFigure 1--Each hardwood can be considered at the center of the various groups of agents which might cause damage.\n\nAny organism exists in an environment which we tend to consider its normal environs (fig. 2). We seldom know how much of that environment is needed and necessary for the plant's well-being, and how much is deleterious to its health and growth. Many of the agents discussed below are part of that environment we consider to be normal and we don't separate out those effects. In the following paragraphs, we will consider the agents when they seem to have an effect outside the normal environment of the hardwood.\n\nFigure 2--Each plant exists in an environment where elements may be considered normal at some level of occurrence.\n\nInsects are usually considered to be a major souce [sic] of potential injury. Here, I've used the broader Arthropoda, which include the Insects but also the Arachnida (spiders and mites) and the centipedes and millipedes. Although many arthropods are important to the proper growth and well-being of the plant, others may cause considerable damage.\n\nPathogens are ordinarily considered to be the fungi and bacteria which detract form the normal health of the plant. The protection specialist may lump some of the arthropod damage into the disease category, so the separation of arthropod and pathogen damage is sometimes unclear even to the specialist. Indeed, the two groups of agents often work in conjunction, producing a synergistic effect where the sum of the damage is more than the individual effects of either of the two.\n\nFire is an important agent affecting hardwoods. Often it is considered only in the light of damaging or killing hardwoods. We must look at it also in its importance in providing the conditions for regeneration and growth of various species. The variety of fire regimes and their differences in effects on hardwoods must be considered just as we consider the differences among arthropods and pathogens.\n\nWeather has great influences on the health of hardwoods. In contrast to climate, the average of the weather over long periods of time, weather varies considerably from the norm over various periods of time. Temperature, precipitation, and wind in different combinations can have disastrous effects on most species, and can work in consort with the arthropods, pathogens, and fire to make the effects worse. As with the three groups of agents above, proper culture of hardwoods is the best protection from weather elements.\n\nVertebrates have important roles in the distribution and health of hardwoods, as anyone who has cultured a garden or forest is well aware. The role may be from the transport and scarification of seeds to the local annihilation of a particular species.\n\nHumans, though only one of perhaps hundreds of vertebrate species which affect hardwoods, play a key role among the agents affecting hardwoods because of our ability to transport the plant itself, many agents affecting the hardwood, and tools and energy with which to modify the plant and its environment. Biologically we are only a subgroup of the vertebrates, but our special abilities warrant separate consideration.\n\nThe hardwood cannot be considered itself as a homogeneous unit. After considering the wide range of species and habitats, we must consider the various organs, stages, and conditions in which the plants exist (fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3--Agents affecting hardwoods may attack one or more plant organs, stages, or conditions. First, let's consider the various organs of hardwoods. Different agents will have different effects on different organs. Some agents will affect only one organ at a given stage of development under a certain range of conditions. Examples would be various arthropods and pathogens. Other agents, such as fire or weather, might affect the entire plant or many organs at the same time.\n\nThe stage of development of a hardwood is another consideration in looking at the effects of agents. Fire and ungulates might keep seedlings or sprouts of hardwoods at a limited size by repeated killing back to ground level, or might result in the loss of seedlings which have no ability to sprout. Combinations of fire, insects and pathogens might cause the loss of old growth. On the other side, birds, small mammals, and weather may be responsible for the transport and planting of seeds for the establishment of new seedlings at some distance from the source.\n\nThe condition of hardwoods is also important in the effects agents will have. Fire, pathogens, or weather may weaken a hardwood for insects to kill it later, or the phenological state of a plant may make it more or less susceptible to an agent. The site on which the hardwood is growing will affect its general susceptibility to agents; the more ideal the site, generally the less susceptible.\n\nAnother consideration in looking at agents and their effects on hardwoods is the \"normal\" environment in which the plant exists (fig. 3). Each plant grows in a specific location where the factors are unique. The characteristics of that location, as well as the genetic makeup of the plant, will influence what will happen. The rate of growth, form, and susceptibility to agents will all be influenced. Further, we generally can't define accurately the elements of this normal situation.\n\nEach group of agents will be considered in turn. The direct effects of the agent will be considered, as well as the indirect effects as the agent works through other agents to affect the hardwood.\n\nInsects are generally considered to be the most damaging among the arthropods, perhaps because of their abundance but also maybe because their damage is so visible. Injury from arthropods may be direct or indirect (fig. 4).\n\nFigure 4--Arthropods may attack hardwoods directly or in conjunction with other agents.\n\nDirect injury from arthropods may be defoliation, such as that of the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica). It is one of several species of worms that feed on oaks, but is perhaps the best known and most studied. Its range extends from San Diego into central Oregon (Wickman 1985). Several papers on this species appear in this symposium. Examples of the interaction among agents are the insect parasites which attack the oakworm (Young 1977).\n\nNew insect pests of plants appear occasionally, introduced from abroad or other localities. Eucalyptus species (Eucalyptus spp.) have enjoyed freedom from many of their natural insect enemies, but the recent appearance of the longhorned Eucalyptus borer may pose a serious threat to some Eucalyptus species, particularly Eucalyptus globulus Acorn 1986). As a newly introduced pest, it may spread more rampantly because it is temporarily from its enemies.\n\nArthropods may also influence other agents affecting hardwoods. The potential for insects to carry diseases has been an important factor in the loss of hardwoods elsewhere, most recently in the loss of so many elms in Eastern United States. Insects may also influence the fire regime, such as the intensity, extent, and return interval of fires. This could occur through changing species composition or overstory cover.\n\nDiseases may affect the hardwoods directly or indirectly through their influence on other agents, and in turn may be affected by other agents (fig. 5). Hect-Poinar et al in this symposium discuss the protection of California oaks from several insects and diseases, and Tidwell (1986) has indexed diseases of California oaks. Diseases may affect the susceptibility to other agents. The interactive cycle with fire, where a tree may be scarred by fire forming an infection court, which in turn may make the tree more susceptible to future fire, insect attack, or wind and snow breakage, might be cited as an important example.\n\nFigure 5--Diseases may act directly to injure hardwoods or in consort with other agents.\n\nFire may be a very important and direct influence on the prevalence of any plant species (fig. 6). It can temporarily remove a species from a site and do much to help another become established -common observations we have all made. Less understood, and often not even considered are fire's role in changing site characteristics and the habitat of arthropods, diseases, and vertebrates in such ways that may greatly favor the establishment and growth of one species of hardwood over another.\n\nFigure 6-Fire may act directly to reduce or increase a hardwood on a site, or may act synergistically with other agents. Martin et al (1976), Mitchell and Martin (1980), and Martin and Mitchell (1980) have considered many of the interactions that might occur among fire, insects, and diseases. Although their papers considered mostly interactions in connection with conifers, in principle the ideas are applicable to hardwoods.\n\nWeather is an agent we all recognize as having a great influence on any plant species, yet one which is not often influenced immediately by other damaging agents. The long-term influence of other agents, particularly humans, may modify the weather and climate.\n\nWeather and climate influence all the other agents and have their direct influence on hardwoods (fig. 7). They influence the species that grow on a site, and, to look back a little further, influence the site itself. As weather changes, the phenological and physiological condition of plants change, making them more or less susceptible to other agents. Drought is often a cause for injury or death of plants. Dieback of the crown or complete loss of plants may occur during and following drought. Drought may also make plants susceptible to insects and diseases. Often it is difficult to determine whether the insects and diseases or the drought are responsible for the decline or death of the plant, or whether it is the combination that is deadly.\n\nWeather which is wetter than normal may also result in injury to hardwoods and other plants. A direct effect may result from the inundation of root systems or flooding which physically disrupts the plant. Wet weather may increase the influence other agents, such as root or leaf diseases which flourish under the wetter conditions. It may be that the Phytophthora fungus attacked the root systems of some shrub and hardwood species during the recent wet winters in California, resulting in plant dieback.\n\nWeather and climate affect the activities of humans, all the way from choices of living sites to daily or hourly activities. The cumulative effects have had and will continue to have a great influence on hardwoods.\n\nVertebrates may affect the well-being of hardwoods in positive or negative ways, often depending on the population of any given species or group of species. Humans, although they technically belong with the other vertebrates, are discussed separately because of their unique nature and capabilities.\n\nVertebrates may affect hardwoods at any stage of development. Perhaps the most obvious are at the seed or sapling stage. Vertebrates may also affect the potential for fires, insects, or diseases to affect hardwoods (fig. 8). Vertebrates may contribute to the distribution, planting, or destruction of seeds. If rodents or birds, in particular, are low in number, the distribution of seeds may be inhibited in those species with relatively heavy seeds. In addition to dispersal, rodents may bury seeds in caches, often leaving unused seeds well-planted for germination. When the population becomes too high, however, most seeds may be used and very few are available to produce seedlings. The swing in population will probably return to the low end in time, thus allowing hardwoods to produce an abundance of seeds which will be available for germination.\n\nLarge vertebrates affect hardwoods by eating seeds, trampling or browsing seedlings, debarking trees of various sizes. Trampling may also provide micro relief and the planting of seeds, or can result in compaction of soils, thus reducing establishment or growth potential. The grazing or browsing may favor the establishment or growth of other plants, in some cases hardwoods, by reducing the competition. Browsing or debarking of trees often provides means for insects to attack hardwoods, which will in turn further weaken or kill the tree.\n\nHumans, because of our unique abilities, can affect not only the hardwoods themselves, but almost all the other agents which may damage hardwoods (fig. 9). Our influence goes even to influencing the weather in the short term if we consider the nature of the rain which falls. The extent to which we influence long-term weather and climate may be more debatable. Since humans are so versatile in the ways they influence hardwoods, from planting and nurturing them on the one hand to cutting and bulldozing them on the other, I'll let the reader ponder the various ways we might influence all the factors.\n\nFigure 9--Humans, through their ability to affect so many factors, may have a wide range of effects on hardwoods.\n\nMany agents influence the well-being of hardwoods at many stages or conditions of growth. An agent at one population level may enhance conditions for hardwood growth, while at another may severely hinder growth or result in hardwood mortality. There is much interaction among agents (fig. 10), and the overall picture would be confusing. Because of all the interactions and the means in which we approach problems, most research on protection of vegetation deals with only a few factors. This approach is both necessary and limiting, and understanding of the entire sphere of influences on hardwoods will continue to be constrained.\n\nFigure 10--The interactions of all agents are so complex that a study of several agents at once would be difficult and expensive, and the study of only one agent at a time may be too simplistic.\n\nEva I. Hecht-Poinar, L. R. Costello and J. R. Parmeter, Jr.\n\nIn the management of oak stands, disease and insect problems are of considerable importance. Some diseases and insects have been known for some time, such as root rot caused by Armillaria mellea (Vahl ex Fr.) Kummer, crown rot caused by Phytophthora spp., pit scales (Asterolecanium minus, Lindinger) tussock moths (Orgyia vetusta (Boisduval)), orange tortrix (Argvrotaenia citrana (Fernald)) and oak troths (Phryqanidia californica, Packard). Other pathogens and pests have only recently been recognized and apparently fluctuate markedly in response to environmental vicissitudes.\n\nThe Index of Diseases and Microorganisms associated with California Oak trees (Tidwell, 1986) lists A. mellea on 10 oak species. This fungus is found frequently on root systems where, under natural conditions, it may cause little damage. However, when oaks are watered near the root crown in the summer or otherwise stressed, they may succumb to this root rot rather rapidly. There is no known effective chemical treatment for a tree with this disease, but if the disease has not progressed too far, cutting out the infected tissue and exposing the affected area to air has been suggested to prolong the life of the tree (Brown et al., 1963).\n\nPhytophthora crown rot is mainly a problem in nurseries or in urban plantings and also is associated with over watering in the summer. Other pathogens of oaks include Spaerotheca lanestris causing powdery mildew and witches' brooming and Erwinia quercina, a bacterium, causing a drippy acorn disease (Brown et al., 1963) just to mention a few.

Since 1977 two diseases in particular have become a problem: a large-branch dieback caused by Diplodia quercina, which is more severe when trees are stressed by drought, and a twigblight caused by Cryptocline cinerescens and Discula quercina which has become severe following some very wet seasons. An association between pit scale infestation and twig blight severity was established, although the nature of this interaction is not clear. Experiments to control the two diseases showed promising results with Banner, Rubigan and especially with pruning and Benomyl. listed 418 spp. of organisms on 37 oak species (native and imported) in California.\n\nThere are 50 insect pests listed on Quercus spp. of which the pit scale often is serious on Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia. Applications of an oil-carbaryl mixture during the period of early crawler emergence (late April through early June) gives effective control of this insect (Koehler et al., 1968).\n\nDuring the last 8 years, dieback (Hecht-Poinar, 1986) and twig blight (Hecht-Poinar, 1981) have become of concern to ranch owners, landscape architects and urbanites in California. This report mainly concerns these diseases.\n\nDieback and twigblight are common and sometimes severe in all of the coast range counties where observations have been made. Tree mortality has been reported in Marin, San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, (Contra Costa, San Mateo, Napa, Solano, and Monterey counties (fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1--Distribution of Dieback and Twigblight on Quercus agrifolia (1982)(1983)(1984).\n\nAreas where systematic surveys were conducted, the disease occurred on a variety of sites, topographies and exposures. Trees varied widely in susceptibility to twig blight. next to trees with severe symptoms (fig. 2).\n\nUnaffected trees frequently were found growing DIEBACK A dieback of large branches (fig. 3) of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. lobata Nee, and Q. kelloqii [sic] Newb. is caused by Diplodia quercina West. This disease appeared after the severe drought of 1976-1977in California (Hecht-Poinar et al., 1981). A similar association was found in Belgium by bland (1945) who reported devastating losses due to Diplodia in red oak forests in the Ardennes following a period of severe drought in the 1940s. During the early eighties, when California experienced several wet winters, this dieback became less severe; it increased again in 1985-1986 following a relatively dry early spring period.\n\nInoculations made with hyphae which had been grown in culture in a laboratory confirmed that infection could occur through wounds, pruning cuts, leaf scars and occasionally petioles. The regular presence of the fungus in buds suggests that petiole infection might occur in nature. However, the failure of the fungus to spread from sporulating infections to nearby healthy branches suggests that direct infections without wounds are not common. The fungus rarely grows from one branch fork to another or down a branch to the main stem. While black staining in the wood may extend for 60 cm from the point of infection, the fungus rarely can be isolated more than a few cm from the point of entry. A large number of inoculations were made on mature Q. agrifolia with different isolates of Diplodia quercina. With each isolate, five branches were used on each of two trees. During the winter months no dieback developed, even though the fungus became established. Following early spring and late summer inoculations, most branches were girdled and killed within 2-4 weeks. Asexual fruiting bodies of the fungus formed above and below the point of inoculation within 1 month and once, in July 1983, within 2 weeks. These structures produced viable spores for about 2 years. Spores germinated within 24 hours in a moist environment. (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished).\n\nExperiments with different concentrations of Benlate (Benomyl-Methyl 1-(butyl carbamoyl)-2 benzimidazolecarbamate) 50% (DuPont) on 64 large oaks in three different locations, showed: 1) the recommended dosage of 1 lb/100 gal Benlate was not as effective against subsequent inoculations with Diplodia as were dosages of 4, 7, and 10 lbs/100 gal.; 2) Benlate could be recovered from the branches up to 15 months after spray application with all concentrations and 3) protection lasted for at least 12 months when the trees were sprayed in May; however 4) when trees which were already infected and showed active fungus were sprayed with the fungicide, no effect on germination of the spores was observed (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished).\n\nThe twigblight (fig. 4) of Q. agrifolia Nee, Q. lobata Nee, and Q. wislizenii A. DC., which has become a serious problem since the early eighties, is caused by at least two organisms: Cryptocline cinerescens (Bul.) von Arx (Morgan-Jones, 1973) and Discula quercina (West) von Arx. (von Arx, 1957;Hecht-Poinar, 1986). Pathogenicity was established for both fungi on oak seedlings in the greenhouse (fig. 5).\n\nInoculations of mature trees and stump shoots were unsuccessful on 10 successive attempts between December 1982 and March of 1984. Results of greenhouse researches suggest that these 2 fungi infect in nature during periods when oaks are producing succulent new shoots in early spring during cool weather. In the greenhouse, mature spores are produced in about 2 months, whereas in the field, mature asexual fruiting structures apparently are not produced following current year infections until late fall or winter, a lapse of at least 8 months. Mature fruiting structures produced large numbers of viable spores after only 6 hours of moisture.\n\nIn infected trees, twigblight may vary from just a few twigs to nearly complete involvement of the crown. Sometimes twigblight is more pronounced on one side of the crown or on lower branches, and observations suggest that repeated heavy infection may lead to death of some trees. Buds may harbor the fungus but acorns have not been found to do so.  An explanation for the sudden epidemic of twig blight is wanting. Anthracnose diseases are often unpredictable and similar outbreaks of leaf and twig diseases have been observed at different times on bay trees, madrones, Chinese elms and other tree species in this area. Some anthracnoses, notably those on Modesto ash and California sycamore, commonly occur at high levels, others such as those on bay rarely produce epidemics. However, observations carried out in cooperation with C. S. Koehler (Hecht-Poinar et al., unpublished) showed that the amount of twig dieback may be correlated with the amount of pit scale (fig. 6). The basis of this relationship has not been determined. It was found that fruiting structures are often produced in a ring around individual scale insects (fig. 7). Crawlers, therefore, might pick up spores as they emerge and disperse, but emergence generally occurs in May, when sporulation is unlikely. A similar interaction between pit scales and Dothiorella (Boyce and Speers, 1959) and Botryodiplodia (Schmidt and Fergus, 1965)   spots under a similar number of scales on undiseased twigs also failed to yield either fungus.\n\nControl experiments against twig blight have been carried out in the greenhouse and in the field with a number of fungicides which had shown promise against the fungi in culture media in the laboratory. Of the 6 fungicides tested Banner (Ectaconazole), Rubigan (EL-222) and Benlate (Benomyl) so far show the most promise in the control of twigblight although data are incomplete at this time.\n\nStephen D. Hobbs and Steven R. Radosevichfoot_7\n\nThe need to control evergreen hardwoodfoot_8 competition in coniferous plantations on Pacific Coast sites (California, Oregon, and Washington) has been clearly established (Cleary 1978, Newton 1981and 1984, Strothmann and Roy 1984, Tappeiner et al. 1986a, Walstad et al. 1986). In young plantations competition results in reduced conifer growth and in many cases, increased seedling mortality. This effect has been well-documented (Zavitkovski et al. 1969, Gratkowski and Lauterback 1974, Radosevich et al. 1976, and others) and has been shown to cause regeneration delays which can produce substantial losses in both timber value and volume yield (Brodie and Tedder 1982).\n\nFor the last several decades perhaps the single most versatile and cost-effective vegetation management tool available to foresters has been herbicides. Yet the controversy surrounding the use of these chemicals in the forest environment has significantly increased in recent years which has resulted in additional restrictions. Despite the fact that many foresters view these restrictions as transitory, it is very likely that opposition to the use of herbicides in forestry will persist and that increasing regulatory limitations will preclude realization of their full potential as a vegetation management tool (Hobbs 1986).\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a strategy and framework for dealing with evergreen hardwood competition in new conifer plantations without the benefit of herbicides using Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Evergreen hardwoods represent a significant source of competition for conifers. This effect can be particularly severe in new plantations where these species cause substantial growth losses and frequently increase seedling mortality. Although herbicides provide a proven, cost-effective method for control of evergreen hardwood competition, increased restrictions on their use have shown that existing alternative vegetation management treatments and strategies need refinement and that new approaches should be developed. Existing nonchemical treatments for controlling evergreen hardwoods are reviewed and a framework for using existing technology presented.\n\nnonchemical treatments based on existing knowledge. Geographically, the paper is limited to those areas with a Mediterranean-like climate, principally southwest Oregon, northern California, and those portions of the Sierra Nevada which support the development of mixed conifer and evergreen hardwood forests. Our discussion is predicated on the assumption that policies conducive to intensive forest management (e.g., artificial regeneration) will be continued through the 1990s. Because the control of competing vegetation is vital to successful reforestation in water limited environments, the focus of this paper will be restricted to vegetation management treatments associated with stand establishment. Although a discussion of nonchemical treatment costs are beyond the scope of this paper, their importance in management decisions should not be overlooked.\n\nEvergreen hardwoods have evolved adaptations which make them particularly well-suited to forest environments characterized by a Mediterranean-like climate (i.e., hot, dry summers and wet, cool winters). Such adaptations afford these species a competitive advantage over conifers until the latter are large enough to limit hardwood growth or cause other concomitant changes in the understory environment which may limit evergreen hardwood regeneration (Tappeiner et al. 1986b). Despite the fact that in many cases conifers eventually become dominant, prolonged competition from well adapted evergreen hardwoods results in lost conifer growth, extended rotations and in some instances, understocked or nonstocked stands. Morphological characteristics such as sclerophyllous leaves with thick cuticles and sunken stomata help to minimize transpirational water loss during summer drought. For some species such as canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis Liebm.), deep root systems are able to tap sources of soil water unavailable to conifer seedlings (Hobbs and Wearstler 1985). Other evergreen hardwood species which lack this ability have extensive lateral root systems capable of quickly extracting water from a large soil volume. Physiologically these plants are also capable of reduced respiration and transpiration during periods of high moisture stress and even though photosynthesis may be reduced, net photosynthesis may still occur up to approximately 15 bars of moisture stress (Hanes 1977). Based on work done by Harrison et al. (1971, cited in McDonald 1982), it is reasonable to suggest that some evergreen hardwood species in southwest Oregon and northern California may be capable of net photosynthesis throughout the year. This has also been suggested as possible for conifers in southwest Oregon (Emmingham and Waring 1973).\n\nReproductive adaptations enable evergreen hardwoods to rapidly reoccupy forest sites following disturbance. For example, many species such as mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus Kell.) can produce thousands of viable seed per hectare. These may remain dormant in the soil duff layer until disturbed by fire after which rapid germination may result when conditions are favorable (Gratkowski 1974). Many evergreen hardwood species are also capable of producing numerous sprouts following either fire or mechanical damage to the above ground portions of the plant. For example, Hobbs and Wearstler .(1985) reported 861,513 sprouts per hectare of canyon live oak and greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Green) during the first year following slashing with chain saws. This adaptation is particularly difficult to control because plants may sprout repeatedly unless meristematic tissues in burls and roots are killed. The ability of evergreen hardwoods to quickly occupy sites following disturbance, whether by seed or sprout, enables them to remain the dominant form of vegetation for many years thus limiting conifer establishment and prolonging the transition to a conifer dominated forest.\n\nWe have not attempted to describe in detail the numerous adaptations this group of plants have evolved, but have mentioned the more obvious characteristics. For a more thorough account of evergreen hardwood adaptations the reader is referred to McDonald (1982).\n\nAmong the reasons seedlings fail to survive or grow following planting is their proximity to associated vegetation. Competition is not the only reason that trees fail to respond as expected following planting, however, but they rarely perform well if subjected to significant levels of it. Competition from associated vegetation can account for very large declines in coniferous tree productivity. Data from various locations in North America suggest that from 2-to 10-fold decreases in forest productivity can be caused from competing vegetation (Stewart et al. 1984). In addition, the presence of hardwood tree species in new plantations can markedly affect the species composition of the stand, and thus, its overall value.\n\nAn important fact about forest vegetation management is that thresholds of competition exist. In other words, there is a level of vegetation control which must be obtained for effective, economical tree responses to occur. These threshold values vary according to the density of trees, proportion of the species involved, and distance to competitors. McDonald (1980) reported an experiment in which a constant density of seedling ponderosa pine (0.1 tree/m 2 = 1,000 trees/ha) was subjected to various hardwood shrub densities (0 to 3.5 shrubs/m 2 ). Canopy cover of the shrubs at the sixteenth year ranged from 0 to 4,100 m 2 /ha. A strong relationship was found between ponderosa pine growth (tree diameter and height) and the degree of shrub density and cover. During the sixteen years of this study, the increase in tree productivity in the shrub-free vs. the heavy shrub stand was 9.5 cm in diameter and 3.2 m in height.\n\nA similar study was conducted by Oliver (1979) on a more productive site. In this study, various spacings of ponderosa pine were subjected to either a constant level of hardwood shrubs (14,000 m 3 /ha canopy) or to no shrubs. After twelve years, the absence of shrubs significantly increased stem diameter, height, and live crown ratio of the ponderosa pine relative to trees growing in shrubs. The effects of shrub association were most pronounced at wide tree spacings. Similar observations have been made in other experiments with other species (e.g., Gratkowski and Lauterback 1974, Radosevich et al. 1976, Allan et al. 1978, Balmer et al. 1978, Nelson et al. 1981, Conard and Radosevich 1982). Generally, trees will not respond to vegetation manipulation in the geographical area addressed by this paper until at least 70 to 80 percent of the competitors have been suppressed. Success of a species will depend on the resource requirements of that species, the availability of resources during periods of demand, and adaptations to partitioning of resources in time and space relative to other species in the community. A generalized relationship between the survival and growth and competition intensity is depicted in figure 1. Lanini and Radosevich (1986) measured the microenvironmental changes and hardwood shrub responses that resulted from three methods of site preparation (rotary chopper, brushrake, or controlled burn) and subsequent shrub suppression by herbicide application. The relative value of vegetative manipulation also was examined by evaluating conifer growth in relation to site resource status. After four years 2,000 m 3 /ha and 7200 m 3 /ha of shrub canopy volume were observed on the brushraked and rotary chopped plots, respectively. The controlled burn was intermediate in response (5000 m 3 /ha). However, herbicide application after any method of site preparation maintained shrub canopy volumes below 1000 m 3 /ha for the four-year study period. Resource availability varied with the level of shrub suppression. Both soil moisture and light were most plentiful when shrub canopy volumes were lowest. However, water abundance was the resource most improved by the absence of shrubs.\n\nPonderosa pine growth responded favorably to increases in both light and soil moisture. These factors interacted significantly to increase growth of ponderosa pine when shrub canopy volumes were low. Increases in soil moisture were more beneficial for sugar pine and white fir height and canopy volume growth than was increased light. However, an increase in white fir stem growth resulting from an increase in soil moisture at low shrub canopy volumes was offset by increased light abundance which had a negative influence. Studies similar to that of Lanini and Radosevich (1986) have been conducted by others (e.g., Zedaker 1981), Preest (1975) and Ross et al. (1986)). In essence, these studies have found a quantitative linkage between the availability of resources, physiological processes, and subsequent morphological development of trees. Gains in growth rate of conifers have generally been greatest when the competing vegetation has been well controlled and when the operations were performed very early in the life of the conifers.\n\nWe suggest that without herbicides, the most critical period for the application of nonchemical treatments is during the plantation establishment phase and that all treatments should focus on promoting rapid, early growth. After site preparation plants will begin to reinhabit the site. The time to manipulate vegetation for greatest success is during this period because the vegetation is usually less prevalent and is often more susceptible to control. Most successful vegetation management occurs within the first five years of a plantation's life. Occasionally competing vegetation becomes so tenacious after planting that some form of suppression must occur to maintain the plantation. It is rare that such treatments ever kill all the competing vegetation. Rather, the goal is to suppress it sufficiently to allow conifers to gain dominance. These treatments must usually occur within a few years of planting in order to be successful.\n\nUnfortunately there is no single nonchemical treatment as effective as an appropriately prescribed herbicide for the control of competing evergreen hardwoods. There are, however, a number of alternatives which may offer potentially useful treatments. Although under certain conditions such treatments may be effective when applied on an individual basis (i.e., a single treatment used during site preparation), a more realistic scenario for many sites is likely to be the utilization of at least two of these treatments during plantation establishment. Regardless of which nonchemical treatments are used, the suggested strategy for the nonchemical management of evergreen hardwood competition should be based on a system of three performance criteria: carefully analyze site conditions; reduce competition quickly and use supplemental treatments if necessary; and strive for operational perfection.\n\nPrior to the controversy about chemical use in the forest, reforestation prescription errors which resulted in rapid site occupancy by evergreen hardwoods, could frequently be remedied with a herbicide application. Currently, such operational flexibility has been severely limited. Although reforestation prescriptions should be based on a thorough evaluation of site conditions likely to exist during the stand establishment phase, such attention to detail is not often the case. Only through a careful on-the-ground inspection of the site prior to harvest can potential vegetation management problems be evaluated. For example, dormant seed buried in the duff layer could not be detected by an arm chair survey, the result of which might be the emergence of thousands of evergreen hardwood germinants following the use of prescribed fire. In the absence of herbicides such an oversight is likely to result in additional treatment expense or the failure to meet minimum stocking standards. Similarly, the sprouting potential of evergreen hardwoods in the understory of mature conifer stands could not be assessed without an on-site inspection. This would indeed be unfor tunate because for some species such as tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. and Arn.) Rehd.) and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh) prediction equations have been developed which are capable of estimating the sprouting response to cutting and fire (Tappeiner et al. 1984). The most crucial aspect of the preharvest site evaluation is to be able to anticipate what environmental conditions are likely to exist at planting as the result of prescribed treatments and how they will affect seedling performance. It is also important to consider how quickly and to what extent these conditions may change due to the encroachment of competing vegetation.\n\nPreviously we suggested that for conifer seedlings the most critical period during which competition from evergreen hardwoods or other types of vegetation should be minimized is during the establishment phase. The exact length of this period will vary among sites depending upon individual circumstances. The concept of a critical period during which weed competition will have a profound effect on crop yield is not new, however. Although this hypothesis is drawn from agricultural studies of annual crops (Zamdahl 1980, cited in Radosevich andHolt 1984) we believe it has applicability to forestry as well. It has been our experience that seedlings grown in environments maintained in a relatively weed-free condition for several years following planting will rapidly increase growth thus dramatically improving the probability of successful establishment. During this period it is the rate of site occupancy by evergreen hardwoods relative to that of planted seedlings that is of primary concern. Treatments which enhance this relationship in favor of conifers should be used judiciously to achieve the desired effect. The long-term objective is to attain rapid crown closure of conifers. We hypothesize that in the absence of herbicides actions taken during the establishment phase will probably affect achieving this objective more than at any other time during the rotation.\n\nHistorically, herbicides have provided the forester with numerous options that add stability and reliability to timber management plans because of their proven effectiveness in temporarily controlling unwanted evergreen hardwoods. However, without this tool or with increased limitations on its use, the forester will lose some of the flexibility to respond effectively to unanticipated vegetation management problems. Under such circumstances the margin for error in reforestation operations will decrease. Mistakes made throughout the reforestation process, from preparing the prescription and growing seedlings in the nursery to post-planting vegetation or animal damage control treatments, are likely to be compounded in terms of seedling performance. Because many nonchemical treatments as currently practices are not as effective as herbicides, increased attention to detail is essential. For example, inadequate planning, sloppy contract administration, and infrequent visits to newly planted areas to assess changes will probably result in decreased stocking. The appropriate utilization of existing technology in a timely manner with an extra helping of common sense and some ingenuity are prominent ingredients for implementing the nonchemical strategy.\n\nWe have identified 12 nonchemical treatments for which some information is available (table 1). The extent of this information varies widely among treatments, however. For example, information on the use of prescribed burning for site preparation is voluminous and yet that related to the effect of preharvest burning on potential post-harvest competitors is confined to relatively few publications. Most of these nonchemical treatments effect seedling performance by reducing the transpirational leaf surface area of evergreen hardwoods thus improving soil water conditions. Other treatments, although not designed to reduce the size or extent of the competitor, are intended to increase seedling survival or growth thus improving the ability to compete. These we refer to as supplemental treatments (i.e., animal damage control, artificial shade, slow release fertilizers, genetically improved planting stock).\n\nPrescribed burning has been used for years to prepare sites for planting and considerable information is available (Loucks et al. 1986). One of the beneficial aspects of this treatment is that it temporarily delays the recovery of sprouting evergreen hardwoods by approximately a year. This has been shown to result in increased soil water (Gaweda 1983). However, such treatments may stimulate the germination of dormant evergreen hardwood seed (Gratkowski 1974) or create conditions favorable for rapid site domination by herbaceous species; particularly grasses. For many sites, post-planting follow-up treatments are likely to be necessary because of sprout emergence or occupancy by herbaceous vegetation. This is particularly true for areas burned after conditions associated with the winter/spring planting season have become unfavorable thus allowing vegetation a complete growing season to recover before the next favorable planting period. This situation should be avoided, particularly on south exposures where moisture demand will be highest.\n\nForesters have much less experience with preharvest underburning but some early results are encouraging (Martin 1982, Kauffman andMartin 1985a andb). Kauffman and Martin (1985b) found that burning while sprouting shrubs were actively growing increased mortality regardless of how much duff was consumed. They also found seed supplies may be dramatically reduced by several preharvest burns and increased duff consumption (Kauffman and Martin 1985a). On soils where duff conservation is a major concern, a single light to moderate burn followed by another type of treatment (e.g., slashing, grubbing, hand-pulling) may be effective although as far as we know this combination has not been tested. Despite the fact that the long-term effects of preharvest burning on competing vegetation are unknown for northern California and southwest Oregon, the treatment may have potential and is in keeping with the suggestion that preharvest treatment of evergreen hardwoods may be an effective method of controlling their recovery following disturbance (Martin 1982, Tappeiner et al. 1986b).\n\nMachine site preparation treatments have been used for many years to control various types of competing vegetation, including evergreen hardwoods. These treatments are, however, usually restricted to slopes of 35 percent or less because of machine limitations. Generally with increasing treatment severity (e.g., soil displacement), the more effective the control of competing vegetation. Concern over the maintenance of longterm site productivity by the retention of surface soil is an important consideration, however, and may preclude the use of some machine treatments on many sites. With less severe treatments such as root-raking without soil displacement or discing, the need for a follow-up post-planting treatment may exist. For more detailed discussions of machine site preparation the reader is referred to Roby and Green (1976), Gutzwiler (1976), Stewart (1978), and Ross and Walstad (1986).\n\nRemoval of young plants that have developed from seed is possible by grubbing with hand tools or may even be pulled by hand. Little information is available on these techniques probably because they have never been seen as realistic options. They are labor intensive and impractical for the control of sprouts developed from previously well-established plants. This type of treatment may have some utility, however, after prescribed fire or machine site preparation treatments which stimulate evergreen hardwood seed germination. Brush slashing_ has received sporadic attention during the last 30 years but has never been viewed as a serious option for the control of evergreen hardwoods. In addition to being labor intensive, brush slashing stimulates vigorous sprouting in many evergreen hardwood species. Little is known, however, about the effect of different intensities, frequency or timing of slashing treatments relative to the species ecophysiology. What little information is available has been recently summarized by Hobbs (1986). This treatment option may have potential when used in conjunction with either pre-or post-harvest prescribed burning or machine site preparation. It is important to recognize the fact that on some sites, slashing may result in rapid site occupancy by herbaceous vegetation. We have observed this to occur in southwest Oregon, particularly on those sites without appreciable amounts of scree or ravel (a mantle of unstable rock fragments or gravel over the mineral soil; usually in steep terrain). On those sites where scree is prominent, the establishment of herbaceous vegetation is often slow and in such cases slashing may offer temporary control of competition. We caution, however, that the haphazard use of slashing may result in a significant first-year sprout response and that more than a single slashing treatment may be necessary on some sites.\n\nScalping has traditionally been done with hand tools (e.g., the planting hoe) at the time of planting to remove vegetation, duff, and scree from the planting spot and to expose the mineral soil. As currently practiced this treatment is not an effective means of controlling either herbaceous or evergreen hardwood competition. This is largely because of the cost associated with creating scalps larger than a square meter around each seedling, and the probable necessity for a follow-up treatment. In addition, evergreen hardwoods larger than a centimeter in diameter are difficult to remove by scalping.\n\nGrazing domestic livestock in new conifer plantations to control evergreen hardwoods has received relatively little research attention although a number of publications are available (Green and Newell 1982, Knipe 1983, Kosco and Bartolome 1983, Leininger 1983, Monfore 1983). Many foresters generally consider this as an unworkable vegetation management treatment because it results in livestock either browsing or trampling conifer seedlings. We feel that although grazing and reforestation have historically been considered incompatible, there may be some potential for this treatment alternative with additional research. Its applicability is likely to be limited to very specific types of site conditions, however.\n\nPaper mulches are used successfully to control grasses and other types of herbaceous vegetation in the immediate vicinity of conifer seedlings. Mulches may require annual maintenance or replacement, however, depending upon individual site conditions. They may be of use in suppressing seed germination, or in killing germinants or very young evergreen hardwoods but are impractical for use with sprouts. Discussions of this treatment can be found in Schubert (1976) and Greaves and Hermann (1978).\n\nIn addition to the preceding treatments we have identified, there are four other treatments we have previously referred to as supplemental which deserve brief mention. These treatments, although not designed to have a direct and immediate impact on evergreen hardwood competition, may influence the rate at which conifer seedlings become established and hence eventually dominate the site. In this respect they may play an important, although largely unquantified, role in vegetation dynamics. We refer to animal damage control treatments, the use of artificial shade and slow-release fertilizers, and the planting of genetically improved stock.\n\nDiscussions of animal damage control can be found in Greaves et al. (1978), Strothmann and Roy (1984), Campbell and Evans (1984), and Schaap and DeYoe (1986). Artificial shade has been shown to increase conifer seedling survival on south aspects. Strothmann and Roy (1984) correctly point out, however, that shade may not be necessary to successfully regenerate Douglas-fir, for example, on south slopes if all other facets of the reforestation process are favorable. Other summaries of artificial shade can be found in Greaves and Hermann (1978) and Helgerson and Bunker (1985). Recent reports have indicated that fertilizers applied to seedlings at the time of planting have a positive effect on growth (Strothmann 1980, Carlson andPreisig 1981). Preliminary results of a trial in southwest Oregon have shown that fertilized seedlings had almost double the first-year height growth of that measured for the untreated controls (O.T. Helgerson, pers. comm. 1986). Gains to be made in seedling growth from existing tree improvement programs are as yet unclear, but all indications are that they will be substantial. This impact will not influence timber management programs until large quantities of improved seed become available for large scale operational use.\n\nThe level of research devoted to the development of nonchemical treatments and strategies for the control of evergreen hardwoods is inadequate to meet future needs. This lack of information extends beyond evergreen hardwoods to most types of vegetation which compete with potential crop trees for limited resources. For many of the evergreen hardwood species we seek to manipulate, there is a significant void in our understanding of their ecophysiology and how they respond to various types of treatments. Only by developing a better understanding of these species can we hope to advance the science of vegetation management into such high-tech realms as biological control and genetic engineering. For the time being, however, a more realistic approach to the problem is to seek ways of using existing information to develop workable strategies and treatments tailored to specific site conditions. A good example of this is the perspective McDonald (1986) provides on the pros and cons of grass competition in young conifer plantations.\n\nIt has been shown that the control of evergreen hardwoods in young conifer plantations improves seedling growth and in some cases survival. Increasing restrictions on the use of herbicides have, however, made the management of these species more difficult and narrowed the margin for error in the reforestation process. Given our current level of knowledge, most nonchemical treatments are not as effective as herbicides.\n\nThey do, however, offer foresters with alternatives that show some potential. These treatments should be refined and integrated into a vegetation management strategy which enhances seedling performance and improves the probability of establishment. Only by expanding our understanding of the evergreen hardwood species we seek to manipulate can we hope to develop acceptable and cost-effective nonchemical treatments.\n\nEffects of Fire and Fire Suppression on Mortality and Mode of Reproduction of California Black Oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) 1 J. Boone Kauffman and R. E. Martin 2 Historically, fire played a major role in shaping the composition and structure of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer ecosystems. Kilgore (1981) characterized the fire regime of mixed conifer forests as that of a frequent, low-intensity sur face fire with a mean fire return interval of 1 to 25 years. As such, it can be assumed that all native species present in this ecosystem developed adaptations to survive in this fire regime.\n\nAs a result of fire suppression, the mixed conifer forest of the present bears little resem blance to that of presettlement times (Biswell et al. 1973, Bonnicksen and Stone 1982, Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979). A century or more of fire suppression has resulted in unnatural accumulations of forest fuels, as well as the creation of a continuous vertical arrangement of fuels. This alteration in fuel dynamics has changed the fire regime from that of frequent, low-intensity surface fires to infrequent, high-intensity crown or stand replacement fires.\n\nOther changes due to fire suppression include alterations in the mosaic of the forest ecosystem (age structure, size and composition). These in clude increases in shade-tolerant conifers with a greater capacity to germinate in organic horizons. In addition, declines in the abundance of California black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) have occurred (Bonnicksen andStone 1982, Parsons andDeBenedetti 1979).\n\n1 Presented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California. 2 Assistant Professor of Rangeland Resources, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon; and Professor of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California, Berkeley, California. Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-100. Berkeley, CA. Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; 1987.\n\nAbstract: Numerous studies, historical accounts and archaeological evidence suggest that the historical density and abundance of black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.) in mixed conifer forests was much greater than today. Reasons for the decline of this species are unknown. However, it is well known that fire suppression since the late 1800's has drastically changed the composition and structure of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. Among the major changes that have occurred is the unnatural accumulation of fuels in an ecosystem with a historical fire regime characterized as that of frequent light surface fires with a mean return interval of 1 to 25 years. Results of this study found that established black oaks were well adapted for survival and resprouting following frequent low intensity/low consumption fires of the past; but not for high intensity/high consumption fires that are possible today. Removal of this heavy organic horizon by prescribed fire resulted in a 2-to 15fold increase in the number of black oak seedlings for the next 2 years.\n\nThe reasons for the decline in black oak are un known. However, in many communities of the mixed conifer zone, fire may be necessary for the main tenance of black oak in the composition. We hypoth esize that fire may affect black oak reproduction in two general ways. The primary effects are those on established individuals from evolution of heat during the combustion process. Depending on severity, environment, and plant factors, fire may result in crown mortality and resprouting, or death to both aboveground and below ground plant organs. The secondary effects are related to the post-fire habitat. Fire may influence the imme diate habitat of germinating acorns by increasing the amount of solar insolation and nutrients available to the plant, or by destruction of allelopathic compounds, fungi or other pathogens. Conversely, the loss or decrease of organic horizons may decrease survival of acorns due to increased exposure or predation. The interaction of wildlife, fire and acorn germination, if any, is also unclear.\n\nObjectives of this study were to: (1) document the relationship between fuel consumption (fire severity) and survival of resprouting black oaks, and (2) describe the relationship between the composition and biomass of the forest floor (duff layers or organic horizons) and black oak germination.\n\nTwo study sites were established in mixed conifer stands of the northern Sierra Nevada of California. The study sites are located at the Blodgett Forest Research Station near Georgetown, California, and the Massak unit of the Quincy Ranger District, Plumas National Forest. Hereafter, these locations will be referred to as the Blodgett and Quincy sites, respectively. 1 Moisture content is expressed as a mean ± 1 standard error. Different superscripted letters above moisture contents and fuel consumption denote a significant difference among treatments within the same location (P<.05).\n\nThe Blodgett study location was characterized as a productive second growth stand, approximately 70 years of age. Mean basal area was 72.6 m 2 ha -1 . Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws), white fir (Abies concolor [Gord and Glend] Lindl. ex Hildebr.) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens Torr.) dominated in the overstory. Very old black oaks and young individuals with a shrub-like physiognomy were present. The soils are classified as occurring in the Holland Family, Moderate Deep Basic (fine-loamy, mixed mesic Ultic Haplo eralfs). Prior to burning, fuel loads ranged from 131 to 177 t ha -1 . Organic horizons accounted for 60 to 80 percent of the total fuel load. Slopes were nearly level (<10%), elevation was 1300 m and mean annual precipitation was approximately 1700 mm.\n\nThe Quincy area was characterized as an open stand of jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb] Franco) and incense cedar. Mean basal area of the overstory was 48.0 m 2 ha -1 . Soils were classified into the Holland Family, Basic (fine-loamy, mixed Ultic Haplo eralfs). Prior to burning fuel loads ranged from 75 to 102 t ha -1 . Slopes varied in steepness from 35 to 75 percent, elevation was 1350 m and mean annual precipitation is 900 mm.\n\nAt each location, six 0.25-ha blocks with four treatment units per block were established. The treatments include four different prescribed burns of varying season and consumption levels and a control (no burn). Burn treatments include an early spring -moderate consumption burn, a late spring -high consumption burn, an early fallhigh consumption burn, and a late fall -moderate consumption burn. The date of burn, environmental conditions and fuel consumption can be found in table 1.\n\nSurvival of the existing shrub component was estimated by randomly tagging 15 to 50 individuals in each treatment unit in each block prior to burning (1983). Shrubs were examined for mortality and survival the next two years after burning (1984,1985).\n\nDensity of oak seedlings was calculated by two measurements in 15 2m2, permanent plots in each treatment subunit of each block. These plots were measured prior to burning (1983) and the second growing season after fire (1985).\n\nFuel loads and consumption were measured by planar intercept (Brown 1974). Four permanent transects were established in each treatment unit prior to burning. Duff depth and biomass were measured at 60 points in each of the subunits.\n\nSignificance among treatments was tested by an analysis of variance in an incomplete randomized block design. If a significant F value was found (P<.05) a Student-Newman-Kuel's test was utilized to determine where differences occurred.\n\nAs would be expected, the high fuel consumption burns (early fall and late spring treatments) re sulted in the highest rates of mortality for the established black oak shrubs (table 2). However, all burn treatments resulted in significantly higher mortalities (significantly lower rates of survival in table 2) than the control. Though there were inherent differences between the two locations, the general patterns of decreasing survival with increasing fire severity were similar.\n\nFrom comparisons of survival between the two locations, it is apparent that survival rates at the Blodgett site were lower than those at Quincy, with the exception of the early spring treatment. This is attributed to two site factors. At the Blodgett site, the understory black oak component was significantly greater. The mean biomass of understory black oak individuals ranged from 163 to 320 g at Quincy and from 3 to 11 g at Blodgett (Kauffman 1986). At all sites, shrubs in the smaller size classes were most susceptible to fireinduced mortality. The majority of black oaks in small size classes predisposed the Blodgett black oak population to higher mortalities.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to higher mortalities was the fuel loadings and associated biomass of fuels consumed by fire. At the Blodgett site, significantly greater quantities of fuels were consumed and hence greater amounts of heat were generated at the base of the shrubs (table 2). Exceptions include the early spring burn treatments. Mean lower duff (0a) moisture contents were 35 and 135 percent at Quincy and Blodgett, respectively (table 1). As a result, consumption of the duff layer was 50.6 and 11.1 t ha -1, respectively. Even though almost five times as much biomass was con sumed by fire at Quincy, the survival rates were equal. These data suggest difficulties in the prediction or comparison of mortality rates without prior quantification of the fuel load and consumption. But when comparing mortality rates at a single location, fuel consumption variables were most often the most significant factor in predicting shrub mortality (Kauffman and Martin 1985).\n\nTwo growing seasons after fire, black oak germinants began to appear in significantly greater densities in all burn treatments with the exception of the early spring treatment at the Blodgett location (table 3). In these treatments, the number of germinants was 2 to 10 times greater in the burn units than the unburned controls. As previously indicated, this burn did not signifi cantly reduce the biomass of the duff component. The post-fire biomass of the duff component in all other treatments was significantly less than control. Apparently, when the duff component was less than 38 t ha -1 , seedling establishment was enhanced.\n\nThe fuel loads of these mixed conifer sites represent an unnatural buildup of downed woody materials. The heat loads produced by the 124 combustion of 60 to 100 t ha -1 in high consumption burn treatments at Blodgett and 48 to 50 t ha -1 in high consumption burn treatments at Quincy were probably a rare occurrence prior to the era of suppression. The frequent surface fires of the past maintained fuel accumulations much lower than today. Therefore, presettlement fires probably affected the resprouting component much like the burn treatment which consumed only moderate amounts of fuels (i.e. 11 t ha -l as in the early spring burn at Blodgett). This low intensity, low consumption burn killed only the smallest of black oak individuals.\n\nResults of this study indicate that successful germination of acorns is enhanced in areas where the duff layers are weakly developed. These are the probable seedbed conditions in which the black oak evolved. Accumulations of forest floor fuels apparently represent degraded seedbed conditions for black oak.\n\nIt is doubtful that black oak is declining in all areas of the mixed conifer zone. At open sites with shallow soils (such as the Quincy site), black oak was found in all size classes. However, prescribed burns did increase the density of germinants at this site. In addition, a different situation existed at the Blodgett site. Black oak was not represented in all size classes. Rather it was only present as seedlings (<1 m in ht) or as very old decadent individuals. In the vicinity of the Blodgett site, there are archaeological sites where Indians ground acorns for consumption. This would suggest a past composition containing a significant amount of oaks. At this location, we suggest that black oak has declined in abundance just as it has at the Sequoia National Park (Bonnicksen andStone 1982, Parsons andDeBennedetti 1979) and Yosemite National Park (Anonymous 1971). The decline of black oak represents a degradation of the community diversity and structure of these communities. The resultant declines in the wildlife habitat values, aesthetic and cultural values should be considered.\n\nThe unnatural accumulations of downed fuels are not the only nor necessarily the major factor for the decline in black oak. Though black oak does not require a mineral seedbed, germination is en hanced by such. It is probable that it does require openings in the overstory through which sunlight can reach the ground. The historic fires created gaps in the canopy and maintained an open character of the stands resulting in greater amounts of sunlight reaching the forest floor. With fire suppression, canopy closure has occurred and a dense midstory of shade-tolerant conifers has developed. This has decreased the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor.\n\nReasons for the increase in the density of black oak seedlings in burn treatments are unknown. But it is apparent that the post-fire seedbed conditions enhanced the successful germination of black oak. The acorns do not require a thermal scarification treatment, nor are there any other dormancy mechanisms similar to those of the Arctostaphylos Adans. or Ceanothus L. genus. Therefore, this response is probably the result of modifications in the habitat which allowed for higher densities of seedlings to establish in burned plots.\n\nDecay of seeds by molds in duff and litter has been suggested as an explanation for pool seedling emergence (Parmeter 1977). Damping off can be decreased by burning duff and litter. Parmeter (1977) stated that it was likely that the often observed success of seedlings on burned seedbeds was due to removal of seed decay, damping off and seedling root rot fungi.\n\nOther factors were also observed to have in fluenced oak seedling densities. Undoubtedly, wildlife play a major role in acorn dispersal. Snow (1973) found that factors influencing the distribution of southern California oaks included concentration of coast live oak (Q. agrifolia Nee) around rock outcrops due to ground squirrels.\n\nMost of the black oak seedlings were thought to have originated from acorns deposited by seed caching animals (i.e. squirrels and stellar jays). Often seedlings were as far as 50 m in distance from the nearest acorn-producing tree. Apparently a symbiotic relationship between the squirrels and black oak exists as squirrels (Sciurius griseus and/or Tamiasciurus douglasii) also tended to benefit from this relationship. After germination many acorns that were still attached to the seedlings contained dormant embryos which were palatable to the squirrels at a period when few other seeds or acorns were present. Squirrels removed almost all of these attached acorns. This appeared to cause few adverse reactions to the established seedling except the loss of ability to resprout from the acorn.\n\nWhether animals preferred burned areas as cache sites or if the rate of acorn germination in burned environments is higher due to increased survival of the acorns, or some combination, is unknown. Additional investigations are needed to describe the animal-fire-acorn germination relationship.\n\nSeveral authors have stated that since the era of fire suppression, most mixed conifer communities have only been exposed to \"minor disturbance.\" We suggest that fire suppression in ecosystems with a fire return of 8 to 10 years is a major distur bance in itself. The vegetation composition and structure have been severely altered. The resul tant and inevitable fire, which in all likelihood will be a crown or stand replacement fire, is the ultimate result of this man-caused disturbance (i.e. fire suppression).\n\nAdaptations of plants to fire are better termed plant adaptations to certain fire regimes (Kilgore 1981). These results indicated that black oak is well adapted to the presettlement fire regime and environment in the mixed conifer zone of the Sierra Nevada. This includes frequent low-moderate intensity, surface fires and the resultant weakly developed organic horizons. In this study, few black oaks were killed by low consumption prescribed fires. High consumption burns that are possible today will kill high per centages of those black oaks in a shrub form.\n\nPrescribed burns should be implemented to consume moderate-low amounts of fuels where increases or maintenance of the black oak population is desired. In order to increase germination success, forest floor reductions to less than 20 to 40 t ha -1 are suggested. This may require a high consumption burn or several burns of lowmoderate consumption.\n\nBlack oak provides numerous values to society. It is very palatable to big game and domestic livestock. Numerous animals also utilize acorns as forage and the trees as nesting or roosting habitat. The tree also is of commercial value as a timber species. Newell (1983) stated that the greatest values of California oaks are the rich ness and diversity that they add to our ecosystems and to our lives beyond the value in a commodity sense. Fire may be necessary to maintain, increase or allow for the reinvasion of California black oak into many mixed conifer communities.\n\nVernard Lewis, W. Jan A. Volney, and James E. Milsteadfoot_11\n\nThe evergreen oak flora is an extensive and important resource in California. America north of Mexico has 68 species of oaks, of which 16 are native to California (Munz, 1970). In California, the dominant evergreen oak is the Coast Live Oak, Quercus agrifolia. Quercus species grow on 15-20 million acres making them one of the largest, although under-utilized, natural resources in the state (Callaham, 1980). Leaf distribution, foliage damage and defoliator number models are exiguous or nonexistent.\n\nIn California, the principal insect herbivore of the Coast Live Oak is the California Oakworm, Phryganidia californica Packard (Furniss and Carolin, 1977). This insect is a native California species whose populations erupt sporadically, every 5 to 7 years, in the state (Harville, 1955). Oakworms feed almost exclusively on oaks: all native and many introduced species are susceptible (Koehler et al., 1978). The population dynamics (Sibray, 1947;Harville, 1955;and Young, 1977), nutritional ecology (Volney et al., 1983a;Puttick, 1986), sex pheromone (Hochberg and Volney, 1984) and frass-drop measurement Gen.

Abstract: A single Coast Live Oak tree (Quercus agrifolia) from Marin County California was selected for modelling the distribution of leaves, damaged foliage and the number of California Oakworms (Phryganidia californica). Branches for the study tree were classified according to crown level and compass direction. Twenty-four each branches were randomly selected, terminal shoot tagged. Resulting data collected per tagged shoot included number of leaves (damaged and undamaged) and oakworm larvae. Numbers of damaged and undamaged leaves, varied with crown level and branch diameter. Modelling showed leaf totals and oakworm of counts little difference when compared with The totals from field observations. aspects ecological and pest management of results are discussed. (Volney et al., 1983b) have been studied in some detailed. Still many gaps remain in our knowledge of this pest's biology, behavior and ecology.\n\nModelling urban pest populations is a recent innovation that is still undergoing development. The greatest advances in modelling are in agriculture (Getz and Gutierriez, 1982) and forestry (Waters and Stark, 1980). Early attempts of modelling shade-tree defoliator systems were by Olkowski et al., 1978. However, no data was presented revealing the number of leaves, foliage damage nor number of insect defoliators. Here, Q. agrifolia leaves from a study tree were counted to produce a model which allows for projections of foliage damage and numbers of E. californica.\n\nA Coast Live Oak tree, Q. agrifolia Nee, was selected for sampling from Marin Municipal Water District land near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County California. All major branches 15 mm in diameter or larger were grouped into three size categories. Every major branch was tagged and assigned to the crown location from which its foliage was borne. These crown locations were obtained by stratifying the crown into three vertical levels and into four compass directions. Vertical levels were obtained by dividing the tree canopy into three equal upright positions. Level 1 being the nearest the ground, Level 2 midcrown height and Level 3 the uppermost third of the crown. Compass direction was defined using standard designations (e.g., north, east, south and west).\n\nThe branch selection method employed for this study was a randomized design adapted from Jessen (1955). Each selected branch was followed by climbing and use of ladders until a fork along the limb was reached. At the fork, the choice as to which lateral limb was to be followed was based on a probability distribution of the cross-sectional branch diameter. At each selection stage, the branch selection probability was recorded. The process was continued until a terminal leaf cluster was reached, later being tagged with weather resistant identifying labels for future observations. This process was repeated two times per crown sampling quadrant, resulting in a total of 24 tagged shoots per tree.\n\nTagged leaf clusters were visited monthly for one year (February 1985(February -1986) ) to make observations on:\n\n1. Total number of leaves. 2. Total number of leaves damaged by oakworms (other defoliator species were excluded). 3. Total number of oakworm larvae.\n\nThese observations were made from ladders at the periphery of the crown.\n\nIn February 1986, 22 randomly selected branches (32 -72 mm in diameter) were excised from the sample tree and brought back to the laboratory. All leaves from field collected branches were sorted into damaged and undamaged categories, their totals recorded and entered into a computer. All data manipulations and statistical testing (Chi-Squared, t-test, F-test, Regression and ANOVA) were accomplished using the Statistical program StatView (Feldman and Gagnon, 1985) on an Apple MacIntosh computer.\n\nMean totals for field collected leaves are presented in Table 1. Total oak leaf numbers increased proceeding up the crown of the tree. These results were shown to be statistically significant. Controlling for crown level differences, damaged and undamaged leaf totals were greatest for branches 49 -64 mm in diameter,\n\nTable 2. All row means were statistically significant.\n\nAlthough studies exist for other hardwood species (Red Maple, Acer rubrum L.) which disclose foliage and defoliator distribution patterns (Volney, 1979), no attempts were made to estimate actual leaf counts. From the current study, the majority of leaves (damaged and undamaged) were found in the upper two-thirds of the crown. The percentage of damaged leaves (75 percent) was high compared to defoliator damage for other oak species (Puttick, 1986). Compass direction and leave growth patterns were not statistically correlated. However, data from a larger tree sample (nine trees) shows differences in leaf counts (Lewis, 1986). As previously reported, oak leaves survive at least 2 years on shoots. The peak leaf flushing period being, March-April.\n\nOf particular research interest, is estimating the number of oakworm causing visual damage. Published findings forward conflicting values. A CIAS pamphlet (CIAS, 1981) states larval densities of 0.5 per shoot as not causing appreciable damage. Yet other workers report complete defoliation at larval densities of 1 per shoot (Volney for et al., 1983a). indicate\n\nthis study larval densities of 3 per shoot resulted in total defoliation (Lewis, 1986). The discrepancies in insect counts may be due to varying sampling designs and the difficulty of randomly sampling trees, especially in the higher crown levels.\n\nNutritional ecology studies conclude older oak leaves are less digestible, particularly late in the summer (Feeny, 1970). This decrease in digestibility is due to increases in Tannin content and leaf toughness. Concurrently, protein availability is diminishing as leaves approach maturity. Similar results were obtained for Q. agrifolia (Puttick, 1985). Because of this process, larval feeding and leaf damage are accelerated as oakworms obtain their nutritional requirements for growth and development. Given this to be true, fewer larvae than expected may cause significant defoliation in the summer compared to the spring generation. However, longitudinal studies on field defoliation rates show elevated levels of Tannin to correlated poorly with protein decline (Faeth, 1985). This finding may explain the patchiness of defoliated trees observed in the field. It has been theorized that temperature or chemical and physical changes within damaged leaves are more important parameters in describing defoliation patterns (Faeth, 1985).\n\nReviewing previously mentioned data tables, most leaves show signs of damage (Tables 1, 2). Damage is greatest at the top of the crown. This is consistent with published reports of oakworm infestations starting at the top and proceeding down the crown (CIAS, 1981). The greatest leaf numbers are for branches 49-64 mm in diameter. It is not known why branches of this size have the more leaves. A possible explanation is that asymmetry of leaves on some branches is due to the asymmetry of sunlight on different compass directions. In Table 3, the model overestimated leaves in the lowest crown level (1). This is due to a bias in the model from more branches being located in level 1 compared to other levels. A weighted correction factor is needed when computing values. Predicted larval and field result are similar (Table 4). However, until the data from all nine sample trees are analyzed, generalizations would be premature.\n\nOakworm populations have been reported to sporadically outbreak. The causes for these outbreaks are unknown. Natural enemies are often cited as the cause for the cyclic demise of field larval populations.\n\nThe exact mechanism is unknown. One possible explanation forward is that at high population densities defoliation allows more light penetration. By reducing foliate surface parasites is area, host location by predators and easier. Another possible mechanism, is chemical and physical changes that occur in damaged leaves act as attractive lures for predators and parasites.\n\nRandom insecticidal treatments are of little benefit if parameters for success (e.g., undamaged leaves, reduced larval and egg counts) are dismissed. Since branch sampling high in the crown is laborious an easier and economical sampling protocol is needed. Frass-drop measurements provides the necessary variable inputs for quick and accurate estimates of insects and resulting damage (Morris, 1949). Oakworm Frass-drop experiments from the laboratory and field have been conducted (Volney et al., 1983b).\n\nReviewing these workers regression equations, the slope value of (1) imply an one-to-one relationship between leaf weight consumed (leaf damage) and weight of frass produced (monitoring tool reflecting damage). In depth refinement of this relationship by correlating leaf biomass consumed by oakworm with biomass lost by damaged leaves is needed. The intended result being, safe and efficacious control campaigns with minimal expense to the consumer and environment.\n\nJames E. Milstead, W. Jan A. Volney, and Vernard R. Lewisfoot_13 Throughout its recorded range, which extends in California along the coastal mountains from San Diego County north to Humboldt County (Harville,''1955) and into Oregon (Wickman and Kline, 1985) the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica (Pack.), feeds primarily on Quercus, Lithocarpus and Castanopsis.\n\nThe oakworm characteristically occurs at low population densities which periodically increase to outbreak levels resulting in severe defolia tion to host trees (Furniss and Carolin, 1977).\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, there are usually 2 generations per year. Oviposition customarily occurs in June and July and again in October and November. First and early second instar larvae overwinter on the lower leaf sur face of California live oak (Quercus agrifolia Nee). During the winter months there is usually little feeding and, if the temperature remains low for an extended period, populations may suffer high mortality. A s the season progresses the developmental rate gradually rises in response to an increase in temperature. Because the distribution of host species (Harville, 1955;Griffin and Critchfield, 1972) clearly extends beyond the limits of the occurrence of sustained oakworm populations, it is probable that temperature and relative humidity are the major abiotic limiting factors. Within areas where temperature extremes allow the continued presence of oakworm populations, older instars may be found feeding at the margins of leaves of all age classes during the spring, summer and fall months. population density on oakworm foliage consump tion has been previously reported (Volney et al., 1983). The current study, an extension of that work covering both spring and summer generations, uses herbivore dry weights in computing nutritional indices and considers the influence of gender in oakworm herbivory.\n\nI n the initial experiments extending from February through August, 1981, third instar larvae were fed in 600 ml. waxed paper cups. The larvae had free access to weighed leaves which were changed 3 times per week. Leaf moisture was maintained by means of a cottonplugged water-filled vial in which the excised leaf was inserted. Undamaged mature current flush (new) leaves and those from the previous (old) flush were selected from each of 2 trees differing in their oakworm infestation levels (sparse = less than 0.05 larvae per shoot; high = ca. 1.0 larvae per shoot). Initial population densities were 1, 2 and 4 larvae per feeding arena. Laboratory temperature and relative humidity was monitored by means of a hygrothermo graph. Mean temperature ranged from 18.4°C to 24.5°C. Mean relative humidity ranged from 35.1 percent to 45.6 percent.\n\nIn later experiments (1986) utilizing foliage taken from 2 sparsely infested trees, growth rates were compared on newly flushed (immature) leaves and the preceeding [sic] generation's mature leaves. First instar larvae were reared singly at 20°C and 58 percent relative humidity in 13 dram plastic vials. The leaves fed to the larvae were changed 3 times per week. No attempt was made to maintain leaf moisture in these experiments. When adults emerged, clean vials were used as mating arenas. Leaves were changed 3 times per week to provide an ovipositional stimulus.\n\nConsumption rates and utilization efficiencies were determined by means of the methods previous ly reported (Volney et al., 1983). All leaves were weighed prior to feeding (fresh weight) and the dry weights of leaf remnants and frass were obtained after a 24 hour ovenization at 105°C. Foliage consumption (I) was determined by subtracting the weight of the leaf remnant from the dry weight of the original leaf estimated from the regression relationship: (oven dry weight = 13.425 + 0.517 fresh weight; r 2 = 0.92; P = 0.0001).\n\nThe dry weight gain (G) was computed by subtracting the initial estimated dry weight of the larvae (larval dry weight = 0.356 + 0.151 larval wet weight; r 2 = 0.92; P = 0.001) from the estimated dry weight of the pupae (pup al dry weight = -3.6 + 0.273 pupal wet weight; r 2 0.95; P = 0.001).\n\nThe population density (D) in the feeding products of the number of live larvae (N) in each feeding period and its duration (t) by the total duration (T). (D = NT/T).\n\nThe mean weight (W) was obtained by dividing the sum of the products of the initial weight (w) of the larvae entering the feeding period (t) by T. (W = wt/T).\n\nThe following consumption and utilization rates were derived:\n\nWithin the range of temperatures that allow survival (table 1) the population dynamics of the California oakworm is affected by many natural enemies (table 2).\n\nLeaf age; the impact of herbivory (reflected in host infestation level), larval population density and sex are among many factors reported to influence consumption and utilization rates (Scriber and Slansky, 1981;Schowalter et al., 1986).\n\nThe results of feeding trials with immature leaves from the current flush, mature leaves from the current flush, and mature leaves from an earlier flush are presented in tables 3-5. The assimilation values fall within the ranges reported for lepidopterous larvae feeding on tree foliage (Slansky and Scriber, 1982).\n\nA diet of immature leaves is associated with more rapid developmental rates, larger insects and enhanced egg productivity (table 5). Larvae feeding on older mature leaves have lower CR and AD values.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, San Luis Obispo, CA, November12-14, 1986.\n\nProfessor of Forestry, Department of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, San Luis Obispo, CA, November12-14, 1986.\n\nProfessor of Forestry and Resource Management, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple Use Management of California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nAssociate Specialist, Plant Pathology, University of California, Berkeley; Farm Advisor, San Mateo Co., California; Professor, Plant Pathology, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's HardwoodResources,  November 12-14, 1986, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo,  California.\n\nAssociate Professor of Forestry and Professor of Forestry, respectively, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oreg.\n\nThe term \"hardwood\" refers to all woody angiosperms exhibiting either the shrub or tree growth form.\n\nDifferent superscripted letters denote a significant difference among treatments.\n\nPresented at the Multiple-Use Management of Symposium on California's Hardwood Resources, November 12-14, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nGraduatestudent, Department of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley; Staff Researcher Canadian Forest Service, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Staff Researcher, Department of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPresented at the Symposium on Multiple-Use Management of California's HardwoodResources,  November 12-14, 1986, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo,  Calif.\n\nStaff Research Associate, Division of Entomology and Parasitology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif.; Research Scientist, Canadian Forest Service, Northern Forestry Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; Graduate Student, Division of Entomology and Parasitology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif."
