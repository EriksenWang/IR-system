    "abstract": "Co-translational protein targeting to membranes is regulated by two GTPases in the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor; association between the two GTPases is slow and is accelerated 400-fold by the SRP RNA. Intriguingly, the otherwise universally conserved SRP RNA is missing in a novel chloroplast SRP pathway. We found that even in the absence of an SRP RNA, the chloroplast SRP and receptor GTPases can interact efficiently with one another; the kinetics of interaction between the chloroplast GTPases is 400-fold faster than their bacterial homologues and matches the rate at which the bacterial SRP and receptor interact with the help of SRP RNA. Biochemical analyses further suggest that the chloroplast SRP receptor is pre-organized in a conformation that allows optimal interaction with its binding partner, so that conformational changes during complex formation are minimized. Our results highlight intriguing differences between the classical and chloroplast SRP and SRP receptor GTPases, and help explain how the chloroplast SRP pathway can mediate efficient targeting of proteins to the thylakoid membrane in the absence of the SRP RNA, which plays an indispensable role in all the other SRP pathways.",
    "full_text": "SRP and SRP receptor (SR) comprise the major cellular machinery that delivers nascent proteins to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the bacterial plasma membrane (Keenan et al., 2001;Walter and Johnson, 1994). The functional core of SRP is the SRP54 protein (called Ffh in bacteria) in complex with an SRP RNA, which recognizes the cargo protein and interacts with the SR (called FtsY in bacteria). The protein targeting reaction is regulated by the guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding domains in both SRP54 and SR. SRP recognizes the signal sequence on nascent polypeptides that emerge from a translating ribosome (Walter et al., 1981). The ribosome•nascent chain complex is delivered to the membrane via the interaction of SRP with SR when both proteins are bound with GTP (Gilmore et al., 1982a;Gilmore et al., 1982b). Upon arrival at the membrane, SRP releases the cargo protein to a protein conducting channel embedded in the membrane (Gorlich et al., 1992;Simon and Blobel, 1991), where the nascent protein is either integrated into the membrane or translocated across the membrane to enter the secretory pathway. GTP hydrolysis is stimulated in the SRP•SR complex, which then drives disassembly and recycling of SRP and SR (Connolly et al., 1991).\n\nThe SRP and SR GTPases comprise a unique subgroup in the GTPase superfamily (Keenan et al., 2001). Both proteins have a GTPase, 'G' domain that shares homology with the classical Ras GTPase fold (Freymann et al., 1997;Montoya et al., 1997). In addition, the SRPtype GTPases contain an N-terminal four-helix bundle, the 'N'-domain, that packs tightly against the G domain. The G-and N-domains form a structural and functional unit called the NG domain. Unlike classical signaling GTPases that undergo large conformational changes depending on whether GTP or guanosine 5-diphosphate (GDP) is bound, the structures of these GTPases are similar regardless of which nucleotide is bound (Freymann et al., 1999;Gawronski-Salerno et al., 2006;Montoya et al., 1997;Padmanabhan et al., 2001 and Reyes, C. & Stroud, R.M., manuscript in preparation). Substantial conformational changes occur only when the two GTPases form a complex with one another (Egea et al., 2004;Focia et al., 2004). Most notably, the G-and N-domains readjust their relative positions such that the N-domains of both proteins move closer to the dimer interface and form additional interface contacts to stabilize the complex.\n\nThe importance of this N-G domain rearrangement is supported by biochemical analyses.\n\nMany mutations at this interface disrupt SRP-SR complex formation and protein targeting (Lu et al., 2001). Interestingly, unlike classical GTPases, free FtsY displays little discrimination between GTP and non-cognate nucleotides. In contrast, FtsY acquires substantial nucleotide specificity only when it binds SRP. These results have led to the proposal that during complex formation, FtsY changes from a non-discriminative, 'open' state to a 'closed' state in which specific interactions between GTP and active site residues are established (Shan and Walter, 2003). Consistent with these observations, the crystal structure showed that, upon complex formation, the rearrangement at the N-G domain interface brings the nucleotide specificity determinant, Asp449, closer to the bound GTP and within hydrogen bonding distance with the amino group of the guanine ring (Egea et al., 2004). Thus, the N-G domain rearrangement is primarily responsible for the 'open' → 'closed' conformational change that occurs during SRP-SR complex formation and precisely aligns active site residues with respect to the bound GTP.\n\nThe unique structural features of the SRP subgroup of GTPases confer upon them many characteristics that are distinct from canonical GTPases. Most importantly, SRP-type GTPases bind nucleotides much weaker than signaling GTPases and release nucleotides quickly (Jagath et al., 1998;Jagath et al., 2000;Moser et al., 1997;Peluso et al., 2001). Therefore, they do not employ nucleotide exchange factors to facilitate the conversion from the GDP-to the GTP-bound form. These GTPases also do not use external GTPase activating proteins; instead, SRP and SR reciprocally activate one another upon complex formation (Powers and Walter, 1995).\n\nA third unique feature of the GTPases engaged in the SRP pathway is the requirement for a universally conserved SRP RNA. Mammalian SRP is a cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complex that consists of six polypeptides and a 7S SRP RNA molecule. Besides SRP54, the other protein components are not conserved, whereas the SRP RNA has been shown to play an indispensable role in protein targeting in all three kingdoms of life. In early biochemical studies on the mammalian SRP, the SRP RNA appeared to be nothing more than a scaffold that holds all the SRP proteins together in a complex (Walter and Blobel, 1982;Walter and Blobel, 1983). The finding that bacteria contains a much simpler SRP, comprised solely of a complex of Ffh and the 4.5S SRP RNA, was therefore intriguing. This smaller RNA contains the most phyllogenetically conserved region of the SRP RNA, domain IV, which is likely to have been maintained for functional purposes (Poritz et al., 1988;Struck et al., 1988). Subsequently, kinetic analyses of the role of the 4.5S SRP RNA on the GTPase cycles of Ffh and FtsY showed that a major role of this RNA is to accelerate complex formation between the two GTPases. In the absence of the SRP RNA, Ffh-FtsY association is extremely slow, with a rate constant of 5 × 10 3 M -1 s -1 . The SRP RNA accelerates their association kinetics by 400-fold, to a rate that can allow the SRP and SRP receptor to adequately carry out their biological functions, thus accounting for the indispensable role of the SRP RNA in the bacterial, archeal and eukaryotic SRP pathways.\n\nA novel SRP targeting pathway was discovered in the chloroplast (Schuenemann et al., 1998). cpSRP54 and cpFtsY are the chloroplast homologues of SRP and SR GTPases, respectively (Franklin and Hoffman, 1993;Li et al., 1995;Tu et al., 1999). cpSRP54 recognizes its cargo, the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins, via a protein adaptor cpSRP43 (Tu et al., 2000). Together, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 deliver the cargo protein from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane via the GTP-dependent interaction between cpSRP54 and cpFtsY (Tu et al., 1999). Surprisingly, the otherwise universally conserved SRP RNA has not been found to date in the chloroplast SRP system. To rationalize the absence of the SRP RNA, we characterized the kinetic and thermodynamic features of the GTPase cycles of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY. We found that, unlike their bacterial and mammalian homologues, the chloroplast SRP and SR GTPases can efficiently interact with one another by themselves. This helps explain why the cpSRP pathway could bypass the requirement for an SRP RNA.\n\nProtein expression and purification. cpSRP54 from A. thaliana was expressed from baculovirus at the Protein Expression Facility of Caltech. Recombinant cpSRP54 is purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) and cation exchange over a MonoS column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient of 150 -600 mM NaCl. cpFtsY from A. thaliana was expressed and purified as described (Yuan et al., 2002). Two additional chromatographic steps [Superdex 75 and monoQ (GE Healthcare)] were added to remove contaminating GTPases.\n\nMutant cpFtsY(D283N) was constructed using the QuickChange procedure (Stratagene) and was expressed and purified by the same procedure as that for wild-type cpFtsY.\n\nKinetics. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C in assay buffer [50 mM KHEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KOAc, 2mM Mg(OAc) 2 , 2mM DTT, 0.01% Nikkol]. GTP hydrolysis reactions were followed and analyzed as described (Peluso et al., 2001). The general procedures for characterizing the basal and stimulated GTPase reactions between SRP and SR have been described in detail (Peluso et al., 2001;Shan et al., 2003;Shan et al., 2005) and are summarized briefly here. The justification for how each microscopic rate constant was derived from these measurements is provided in Supplementary Material.\n\nBasal GTPase or XTPase activities of cpSRP54, cpFtsY and cpFtsY(D283N) were measured in single-turnover reactions as described ([GTP] << [E]; Peluso et al., 2001). The dependence of the observed rate constant (k obsd ) on protein concentration were fit to Eq 1, in which k max is the maximal rate constant at saturating protein concentrations, and K 1/2 is the protein concentration required to reach half the maximal rate.\n\n(1)\n\nThe nucleotide affinities of the GTPases were determined using several independent methods. The GTP affinities for cpSRP54 and cpFtsY and the XTP (xanthosine-5'-triphosphate) affinity for cpFtsY(D283N) were obtained from the K 1/2 values obtained from fits of the basal GTPase or XTPase reactions to Eq 1. Because the chemical step is rate-limiting for the basal GTPase and XTPase reactions, K 1/2 is equal to K d , the dissociation constant of the nucleotide.\n\nThe affinities of GDP, GppNHp (5'-guanylylimido-diphosphate), XDP (xanthosine-5'diphosphate) and XppNHp (5'-xanthylylimido-diphosphate) were determined using these nucleotides as inhibitors of the basal GTPase or XTPase reactions (Peluso et al., 2001). With sub-saturating protein, the inhibition constant K i is equal to K d . Finally, the binding of nucleotides to the GTPases was determined directly by using fluorescent N-methyl-anthraniloyl (mant) derivatives of GTP, GDP, and XTP, as described below.\n\nThe reciprocally stimulated GTPase reaction between cpSRP54 and cpFtsY was determined in multiple turnover reactions ([GTP] >> [E]) in the presence of a small, fixed amount of cpSRP54 and varying concentrations of cpFtsY, using a GTP concentration that saturates both GTPase sites. The concentration dependence of the observed rate constant (k obsd ) is fit to eq 2, in which k cat is the rate constant at saturating cpFtsY concentrations, and K m is the\n\n(2) concentration of cpFtsY that gives half the maximal rate. The stimulated GTPase reaction between cpSRP54 and GTP-bound cpFtsY(D283N) was determined using the same experimental setup. The stimulated GTPase reaction of cpSRP54 by XTP-bound cpFtsY(D283N) was determined analogously, except that the concentration of GTP and XTP were adjusted such that cpSRP54 was predominantly occupied by GTP whereas cpFtsY(D283N) was predominantly occupied by XTP.\n\nThe cpFtsY(D283N)-stimulated GTP hydrolysis from cpSRP54 was also determined in single turnover experiments. The hydrolysis of trace GTP* was monitored in the presence of sub-saturating cpSRP54 and varying amounts of cpFtsY(D283N), with 25 μM XTP present to selectively occupy the active site of cpFtsY(D283N). Under these conditions, the third-order reaction: GTP* + cpSRP54 + cpFtsY(D283N) •XTP → products was followed. The reciprocal reaction, XTP* + cpFtsY(D283N) + cpSRP54 •GTP → products was determined using an analogous setup, except that the concentration of cpSRP54 was varied and 25 μM GTP was present to selectively occupy the active site of cpSRP54. The data were fit to eq 1 above.\n\nFinally, first-order rate constants of the stimulated GTP and XTP hydrolysis reactions from the *GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •XTP* complex were determined using high concentrations of both proteins (20-80 μM) in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of their respective nucleotides.\n\nThe reaction time courses were monitored in a Kintek quench flow apparatus and fit to a singleexponential rate equation to obtain the first order rate constants.\n\nThe effect of XTP on the reaction *GTP• cpSRP54 + cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP* → products was determined in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of both proteins and a high concentration of GTP (200 μM) to saturate both active sites. The XTP concentration dependence was fit to eq 3, in which k 0 is the rate constant in the absence of any inhibitor, k 1 is the rate\n\nconstant at infinite XTP concentrations, and is the apparent inhibition constant of XTP determined from this experiment. is related to the dissociation constant of XTP by eq 4,\n\nin which and are the dissociation constants of XTP and GTP for cpFtsY(D283N), respectively.\n\nFluorescence. All fluorescence measurements were conducted at 25 °C using the single photon counting Fluorolog 3-22 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon). Fluorescence emission spectra of mant-derivatives of GTP, GDP and XTP were acquired using an excitation wavelength of 356 nm. Nucleotide binding affinities were determined by recording the change in fluorescence intensity at 445 nm in the presence of 0.4-1 μM mant-nucleotides and increasing concentrations of cpSRP54, cpFtsY, or cpFtsY(D283N). The data were fit to Eq 5, in which F max is the\n\nfluorescence at saturating protein concentrations, F 0 is the fluorescence in the absence of any protein, and K d is the dissociation constant of the mant-nucleotide.\n\nThe rate constants for dissociation of mant-GTP and mant-GDP were determined using a pulse chase experiment as described (Jagath et al., 1998). The time course for decay of fluorescence was followed in a stopped flow apparatus (Applied photophysics) and fit to single exponential functions to obtain the dissociation rate constants.\n\nTo understand why and how the cpSRP pathway bypasses the requirement for an SRP RNA, which plays a critical role in facilitating the interaction between the SRP and SR GTPases in all the other SRP pathways, we characterized the rate and equilibrium of the individual steps in the GTPase cycles of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY and their GTP-dependent interaction with one another (Figure 1). Each protein can bind and hydrolyze GTP by itself (steps 1-3 for cpSRP54 and 1'-3' for cpFtsY). cpSRP54 forms a stable complex with cpFtsY when both proteins are bound with GTP (step 4). Both GTP molecules are rapidly hydrolyzed from the complex (step 5). GTP hydrolysis destabilizes the complex and drives its dissociation (step 6). The rate and equilibrium constants for each step are summarized in Table 1. For simplicity, additional possibilities such as hydrolysis of one of the GTPs followed by complex disassembly are not shown; these possibilities are presented in the Discussion.\n\nWe first determined the basal GTP hydrolysis activities of the individual GTPases. Both proteins hydrolyze GTP slowly, with maximal hydrolysis rates of 0.017 and 0.0045 min -1 at saturating protein concentrations for cpSRP54 and cpFtsY, respectively (Figure 2). The protein concentration dependence of the hydrolysis rate gives the affinity of each protein for GTP. Both\n\nGTPases bind their substrates weakly, with dissociation constants of 2.8 and 2.1 μM for cpSRP54 and cpFtsY, respectively (Figure 2). We also determined the affinities of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY for GDP and the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GppNHp by using these nucleotides as competitive inhibitors of the basal GTPase reactions. Both proteins bind GDP and GppNHp weakly, with inhibition constants in the micromolar range (Table 2).\n\nWe directly measured the interaction of nucleotides with both GTPases using fluorescent mant-derivatives of GTP and GDP. Binding of both GTPases to mant-GTP or mant-GDP induces a 50-80% increase in fluorescence (Figure 3A & 3B, respectively). Titration of this fluorescence change as a function of protein concentration gave dissociation constants of 6.5 and 11 μM for binding of mant-GTP and mant-GDP to cpSRP54, respectively, and 1.9 and 3.1 μM for binding of mant-GTP and mant-GDP to cpFtsY, respectively (Figure 3C & 3D; Table 2). For cpFsY, these affinities are the same, within error, as those of unmodified nucleotides determined using the GTPase assay. For cpSRP54, these affinities are only ~two-fold larger than those of unmodified GTP and GDP. Thus, the mant-group does not significantly perturb the binding of nucleotides.\n\nA hallmark of the SRP subgroup of GTPases is the fast rate at which they release and exchange nucleotides. The weak nucleotide binding affinities of cpSRP54 and cpFtsY suggest that this is also the case for the chloroplast SRP GTPases. This was confirmed by directly measuring the dissociation rate constants of mant-GTP and mant-GDP. As expected, both cpSRP54 and cpFtsY release mant-GTP quickly, with dissociation rate constants of 10.4 and 5.4\n\ns -1 , respectively (Figure 3E and Table 1). Similarly, mant-GDP is released quickly by both cpSRP54 and cpFtsY, with dissociation rate constants of 32 and 8.1 s -1 , respectively (Figure 3F and Table 1). Thus, analogous to their bacterial and mammalian homologues, the chloroplast SRP GTPases hydrolyze GTP slowly and can exchange nucleotides quickly, in contrast to classical signaling GTPases that release nucleotide slowly (on the order of 10 -3 -10 -4 s -1 ) and require external exchange factors to facilitate nucleotide release.\n\nIn classical SRP systems, complex formation between the SRP and SR GTPases is very slow and is accelerated 400-fold by the SRP RNA (Peluso et al., 2000;Peluso et al., 2001).\n\nOnce a complex is formed, SRP and SR stimulate each other's GTPase activity and the rate of this stimulated GTPase reaction within the complex is also accelerated 5-10 fold by the SRP RNA (Peluso et al., 2001). As no SRP RNA has been found in the chloroplast SRP system, we asked whether and how efficiently cpSRP54 and cpFtsY can interact with and activate each other in the absence of an SRP RNA.\n\nTo this end, we determined the rate of stimulated GTP hydrolysis reaction in the presence of both cpSRP54 and cpFtsY; GTPase activation in the cpSRP54•cpFtsY complex provides a means to monitor complex formation between the two GTPases (Peluso et al., 2000;Peluso et al., 2001). To our surprise, cpSRP54 and cpFtsY interact with each other efficiently even in the absence of an SRP RNA (Figure 4, ). The slope of the initial linear portion of the protein concentration dependence, which represents the rate constant of the reaction: GTP• cpSRP54 + cpFtsY •GTP → products (k cat /K m ), is ~400-fold faster than that of the corresponding reaction between the E. coli GTPases in the absence of the SRP RNA (Figure 4, ). Indeed, this rate constant matches that of the E. coli GTPases in the presence of the 4.5S SRP RNA (Figure 4, ).\n\nThe rate constant at saturating protein concentrations, which represents the rate of GTP hydrolysis within the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY •GTP complex, is also identical between the chloroplast and the E. coli GTPases in the presence of the SRP RNA ( vs. ), and 8-fold faster than that of the E. coli GTPases without the RNA bound ( ).\n\nIn the E. coli SRP system, complex formation is rate-limiting for the reaction: GTP• SRP + FtsY •GTP → products (both in the presence and absence of SRP RNA) (Peluso et al., 2001).\n\nTherefore, k cat /K m is equal to the association rate constant between the two GTPases. If this were also true for the cpSRP54 and cpFtsY, then the association between cpSRP54 and cpFtsY would be 400-fold faster than their E. coli homologues. Alternatively, k cat /K m is limited by the chemical step instead of complex formation for the chloroplast GTPases. If this were true, then the difference in association rates between the chloroplast and E. coli GTPases would be even greater. Thus the results in Figure 4 demonstrate that complex formation between the chloroplast SRP and SR GTPases is much more efficient than that of their bacterial and mammalian homologues and therefore do not need the help from an SRP RNA.\n\ncpFtsY exhibits high nucleotide specificity.\n\nAssociation between bacterial SRP and SR GTPases is slow presumably because significant domain rearrangements are required to form a stable complex, including a change A prediction from this model is that cpFtsY can effectively discriminate between cognate and non-cognate nucleotides by itself without the help from cpSRP54. To test this idea, we mutated the conserved specificity determinant, Asp283, to an asparagine. This mutation converts many GTPases to XTP-specific proteins by swapping the hydrogen bond between the carboxylate oxygen of Asp and the exocyclic amino group of the guanine ring (Bishop et al., 2000;Hwang and Miller, 1987;Weijland et al., 1994;Zhong et al., 1995). As predicted, wildtype cpFtsY preferentially hydrolyzes GTP. The rate constant of the reaction: GTP* + FtsY → GDP + P i * is 37-fold faster than that of mutant cpFtsY(D283N) (Figure 5A). Similarly, mutant cpFtsY(D283N) hydrolyzes XTP much faster than wild-type cpFtsY (Figure 5B). In contrast, E.\n\ncoli FtsY exhibits no more than a four-fold difference between wild-type and mutant GTPases in the hydrolysis rates of either nucleotide (Shan et al., 2003).\n\nWe next asked if cpFtsY can specifically bind its cognate nucleotide. Using both the GTPase assays (Figure 5, C-D) and fluorescent mant-nucleotides (Figure 5, E-F), we showed that wild-type cpFtsY preferentially binds guanine-based nucleotides, with affinities 40-70 fold higher than mutant cpFtsY(D283N) (Table 2). Analogously, mutant cpFtsY(D283N)\n\npreferentially binds xanthine-based nucleotides, with affinities 90-250 fold higher than wild type cpFtsY (Table 2). In contrast, E. coli FtsY exhibits no more than a two-fold discrimination between wild-type and mutant GTPases for any nucleotides (Shan and Walter, 2003). Together, the results in this section show that, unlike its bacterial homologue, the active site of cpFtsY can specifically recognize GTP even in the absence of cpSRP54. This is consistent with the notion that free cpFtsY is already in the 'closed' conformation and pre-organized to interact with cpSRP54.\n\nThe XTP-specific mutant cpFtsY(D283N) also allowed us to test whether cpSRP54 and cpFtsY reciprocally stimulate the GTPase activity of one another, as is the case for the bacterial system. If this were the case, XTP hydrolysis by cpFtsY(D283N) would be stimulated by cpSRP54 and, conversely, GTP hydrolysis by cpSRP54 would be stimulated by cpFtsY(D283N).\n\nTo examine the effect of cpFtsY(D283N) on GTP hydrolysis by cpSRP54, we measured the rate of GTP hydrolysis in the third order reaction: GTP* + cpSRP54 + D283N •XTP → GDP + P i *. As predicted, the rate of GTP hydrolysis is significantly stimulated by the presence of cpFtsY(D283N) (Figure 6A), consistent with the notion that cpFtsY acts as the activating protein for cpSRP54. Analogously, the reciprocal reaction, XTP hydrolysis by cpFtsY(D283N), is significantly stimulated by the presence of cpSRP54 (Figure 6B; the third-order reaction: XTP* + D283N + cpSRP54 •GTP → XDP + P i * was followed).\n\nInterestingly, the rate of stimulated GTP hydrolysis from cpSRP54 is ~10-fold slower than that of XTP hydrolysis from cpFtsY(D283N) (cf. rates in Figure 6A & 6B), raising the possibility that nucleotide hydrolyses from the two GTPase sites in the complex are not symmetric. To test this possibility, we formed the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •XTP complex by using high concentrations of both proteins and stoichiometric amounts of GTP and XTP, and directly measured the rate constants for hydrolysis of both GTP and XTP from this complex. As shown in Figure 6C, the rate constant for XTP hydrolysis is 3.7 min -1 (squares), over four-fold faster than the rate constant of 0.87 min -1 for GTP hydrolysis (circles). This represents only a lower limit for the difference in hydrolysis rates between the two active sites, because cpFtsY(D283N) bound with GTP is much more active in binding and activating cpSRP54 (see the next section), even though it preferentially binds XTP by itself. Thus, part of the GTP hydrolysis rate observed in Figure 6C (circles) is contributed by an alternative GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP complex. The actual difference between the hydrolysis rates from the two active sites is larger than that observed in Figure 6C and is closer to the ~10-fold difference observed in Figures 6A and 6B. This is because the experiments in Figures 6A and 6B measures the rate of third order reactions, which is determined by the affinities of free cpSRP54 and cpFtsY(D283N) for their respective nucleotides as well as the rates at which GTP and XTP are hydrolyzed from the respective active sites in the complex. Since cpSRP54 and cpFtsY(D283N) exhibits similar affinities for GTP and XTP, respectively (Table 2), the observed ~10-fold difference in the observed reaction rate (Figures 6A and B) primarily reflects the difference in hydrolysis rate from the two active sites. Thus, like the classical SRP systems, cpSRP54 and cpFtsY act as reciprocal activating proteins for one another, yet unlike their bacterial homologues, nucleotide hydrolyses from the two active sites are asymmetric.\n\nAnother intriguing observation from the results in Figure 6C is that the rate constants of the stimulated GTPase and XTPase reactions from the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •XTP complex (0.87 and 3.7 min -1 , respectively) are over 10-fold slower than that from the wild-type GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY •GTP complex (Figure 4), even accounting for the fact that two GTP molecules are hydrolyzed in the wild-type complex. Therefore, we suspected that the D283N mutation or the replacement of GTP with XTP renders cpFtsY less active in binding and activating cpSRP54. This is reminiscent of the behavior of an XTP-specific mutant of the E. coli SRP GTPase, SRP(D251N), which is deficient in binding and activating FtsY in its XTP-bound form. Instead, mutant SRP(D251N) can better bind and activate FtsY when bound to the noncognate GTP (Shan and Walter, 2005).\n\nTo test whether this is also the case for mutant cpFtsY(D283N), we measured the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis from the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP complex when cpFtsY(D283N) is forced to bind its non-cognate nucleotide by using a high GTP concentration.\n\nWhen mutant cpFtsY(D283N) is bound with the non-cognate GTP, the rate of stimulated GTP hydrolysis is much faster than when it is bound with the cognate XTP (Figure 7A, diamonds vs. squares). The rate constant at saturating protein concentration, which represents the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis from the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP complex, is comparable to that of the wild-type complex (Figure 7A; diamonds vs. circles), suggesting that the GTP• cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP complex achieves the same active conformation as the complex formed by the wild-type proteins. As a five-fold higher concentration of mutant cpFtsY(D283N) than wild-type cpFtsY is required to reach saturation, complex formation is modestly compromised for GTP-bound cpFtsY(D283N) (Figure 7A; diamonds vs. circles). In contrast, no saturation is observed in the reaction with XTP-bound cpFtsY(D283N) up to 30 μM (squares), indicating that complex formation is significantly compromised when the mutant is bound with its cognate nucleotide. Thus, mutant cpFtsY(D283N) prefers the non-cognate GTP over cognate XTP when it forms a complex with cpSRP54.\n\nTo provide independent evidence on this switch in nucleotide preference upon complex formation, we explored the effect of XTP on the rate of the reaction: GTP• cpSRP54 + cpFtsY(D283N) •GTP → products. If cpFtsY(D283N) is less active in binding and activating the GTPase reaction of cpSRP54 when it is bound with cognate XTP than with non-cognate GTP, then addition of XTP, which competes off the GTP bound at the active site of cpFtsY(D283N), should inhibit the stimulated GTPase reaction. As predicted, addition of XTP inhibits this stimulated reaction (Figure 7B). The observed inhibition constant for XTP is 9.0 μM, consistent with the expected value of 8.9 ± 0.9 μM given the affinities of mutant cpFtsY(D283N) for GTP and XTP and the GTP concentration used in this experiment (Eq 4 in the Methods). This strongly suggests that the binding of XTP to cpFtsY(D283N) is responsible for the observed inhibitory effect. Taken together, the results in this section show that although cpFtsY(D283N) by itself exhibits a specificity for XTP, this mutant prefers the noncognate GTP for interacting with and stimulating GTP hydrolysis from cpSRP54. Thus, Asp283 and/or the bound GTP play a much more important role than specifying the nucleotide preference of cpFtsY and likely participate in critical interface interactions with cpSRP54 in the cpSRP54•cpFtsY complex.\n\ndisassembly and recycling of the SRP and SR (Connolly et al., 1991;Wilson et al., 1988). Here, we showed that cpSRP54 and cpFtsY can interact efficiently with each other even in the absence of an SRP RNA: their association rate is at least as fast as that of their E. coli homologues that contain the SRP RNA, and GTP hydrolysis from the cpSRP54•cpFtsY complex also occurs at the same rate as the E. coli GTPase complex in the presence of the RNA. This helps explain how the chloroplast SRP system can bypass the requirement for the SRP RNA.\n\nWhy is the protein-protein interaction so efficient between the chloroplast GTPases?\n\nInteraction between the bacterial SRP and SR GTPases is slow presumably due to the requirement for extensive conformational changes during complex formation. One of the important rearrangements is a repositioning of the N-G domain interface, which led to a change of the GTPase site from a floppy, non-specific 'open' state to a 'closed' state in which active site interactions with the bound nucleotide are established (Shan and Walter, 2003). Thus, one possibility is that cpSRP54 and cpFtsY are pre-organized into the 'closed' conformation that is ready to interact with each other. The results herein strongly suggest that this is the case at least for cpFtsY. Free cpFtsY can specifically recognize its cognate nucleotide, in contrast to E coli FtsY which acquires nucleotide specificity only when it forms a complex with SRP. Further, cpFtsY exhibits higher affinities for GTP and GDP than its bacterial homologues, with dissociation constants of 2-3 μM instead of 19-30 μM for E. coli FtsY. These observations strongly support the notion that free cpFtsY is pre-organized in a 'closed' conformation, and thus can interact with cpSRP54 without paying substantial energetic penalty to rearrange the relative position of the N-and G-domains. It remains to be seen whether cpSRP54 is similarly preorganized into the 'closed' conformation prior to interaction with cpFtsY.\n\nIt appears that the SRP RNA has been evolved to accelerate the very inefficient interaction between the SRP and SR GTPases in classical SRP pathways. Although models are abundant (Buskiewicz et al., 2005;Peluso et al., 2000;Spanggord et al., 2005), the molecular mechanism by which the SRP RNA acts as a catalyst to accelerate both the formation and disassembly of the SRP•SR complex is still poorly understood. It is possible that in the transition state for complex assembly, the SRP RNA may provide a transient tether that\n\nfacilitates the rearrangement of one or both GTPases into the 'closed' conformation;\n\nalternatively, the RNA and the chloroplast GTPases may employ completely different mechanisms to attain a faster association kinetics.\n\nThe crystal structure of the T. aquaticus Ffh•FtsY complex shows that the two GMPPCP molecules are bound at a composite active site formed at the dimer interface (Egea et al., 2004;Focia et al., 2004). Consistent with the composite nature of the active site and the extensive degree of crosstalk between the two GTPase sites, the two nucleotides are hydrolyzed at the same rate from the E. coli SRP•FtsY complex. These observations have led to earlier proposals of concerted GTP hydrolyses in the SRP•SR complex (Powers and Walter, 1995). In contrast to this notion, we showed here that nucleotide hydrolysis in the cpSRP54•cpFtsY complex can be asymmetric, with the nucleotide hydrolyzing ~10-fold faster from the cpFtsY than the cpSRP54 active site. This observation argues against a concerted mechanism. Even in the E. coli system, mutant GTPases have been identified in which GTP is hydrolyzed much faster from the SRP than the FtsY active site (Shan et al., 2004). Further, when either of the GTPases is bound with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, it can still activate efficient GTP hydrolysis on its binding partner (Shan, S., unpublished results). Together, these results strongly suggest that hydrolyses of the two GTPs in the SRP•SR complex do not proceed through a concerted mechanism or an ordered pathway (i.e., one GTP must be hydrolyzed first before hydrolysis of the second GTP can occur). Rather, each active site can hydrolyze its bound GTP independently.\n\nEven though the nucleotide is hydrolyzed ~10-fold slower from cpSRP54 than from cpFtsY(D283N), multiple rounds of XTP hydrolysis from the cpSRP54•cpFtsY(D283N) complex is not blocked and occur as efficiently as single turnover reactions (data not shown).\n\nThus, disassembly of the complex must occur on a faster time scale than the second hydrolysis event, implying that SRP and SR can dissociate from one another even when only one of the nucleotides is hydrolyzed. A similar observation was made for the E. coli SRP•SR complex (Shan et al., 2004). Together, the data from the E. coli and chloroplast systems suggest that only one GTP hydrolysis event is required to drive disassembly of the SRP•SR complex. It remains to be clarified how many GTPs need to be hydrolyzed during each round of protein targeting, and what the precise role of each GTP hydrolysis event is.\n\nGiven the high specificity of cpFtsY(D283N) for XTP, it is surprising to find that this mutant prefers the noncognate GTP over the cognate XTP when it forms a complex with cpSRP54. This strongly suggests that Asp283, in addition to conferring nucleotide specificity to cpFtsY, also contributes to interactions at the dimer interface. The behavior of cpFtsY(D283N) is reminiscent of an XTP-specific mutant of the E. coli SRP GTPase, Ffh(D251N), which also prefers GTP over XTP when it forms a complex with FtsY (Shan and Walter, 2005). The crystal structure confirms that Asp251 makes an important interface contact with Lys390 from FtsY (Egea et al., 2004;Focia et al., 2004). A similar interaction could be formed by Asp283 of cpFtsY with a hydrogen bond donor (-AH) at the interface of the cpSRP54•cpFtsY complex (Figure 8A). When cpFtsY(D283N) is bound to XTP, mutation of Asp283 to Asn destroys this interface contact and compromises the interaction between the two GTPases (Figure 8B). In contrast, replacement of XTP with GTP no longer constrains Asn283 in this particular configuration; a rotation around the C β -C γ bond can reposition the carbonyl oxygen of Asn283 close to the hydrogen bond donor from cpSRP54, thus restoring this interface contact (Figure 8C). Alternatively, the exocyclic amino group of GTP could directly interact with a hydrogen bond acceptor from cpSRP54 (Figure 8D, -B:), therefore replacement of GTP with XTP compromises the cpSRP54-cpFtsY(D283N) interaction. In either scenario, our results map the G-IV motif of cpFtsY and its bound nucleotide to the dimer interface between the two GTPases, and demonstrate the presence of extensive crosstalk between the two GTPase sites.\n\nThe results here help rationalize why the chloroplast SRP targeting pathway bypasses the requirement for the SRP RNA, as the SRP and SR GTPases from chloroplast can interact efficiently with one another without the help from the RNA. The novel cpSRP43 protein, which together with cpSRP54 forms the chloroplast SRP, has often been viewed as a functional replacement for the SRP RNA. Our results show that the chloroplast GTPases have evolved to efficiently interact with one another. Although a previous study has suggested a moderate effect of cpSRP43 on the stimulated GTPase reaction between cpSRP54 and cpFtsY (Goforth et al., 2004), a more thorough kinetic analysis showed that the cpSRP43 protein does not provide additional acceleration of the interaction between these two chloroplast GTPases (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, cpSRP43 does not replace all of the functions of the SRP RNA. This novel chloroplast protein may have evolved to mediate other important roles of the SRP RNA in the protein targeting reaction, such as recognition of the cargo protein (Schuenemann et al., 1998;Tu et al., 2000). Analogously, the SRP RNA may have been evolved to interact with ribosomal RNAs during co-translational protein targeting in the classical SRP pathways (Halic et al., 2004;Halic et al., 2006;Rinke-Appel et al., 2002;Schaffitzel et al., 2006).\n\nIt is fascinating to speculate on the evolutionary origin of the vast difference in the interaction kinetics between the SRP and SR GTPases from chloroplast versus those from classical SRP pathways, and why cells have evolved the SRP RNA to deal with the inefficient interaction between the SRP and SR GTPases in the classical pathway. An intriguing possibility is that the slow interaction kinetics between the SRP and SR GTPases in classical pathways provides additional opportunities for regulation and for improving fidelity. Compared to the time scale of protein targeting, the interaction kinetics between SRP and SR is still relatively slow even with the RNA present. The ribosome and/or the cargo protein, however, further accelerates the interaction between the two GTPases (Zhang et al, unpublished results). The SRP RNA, bound in close vicinity to the signal sequence binding site, could mediate this additional stimulation of the SRP-SR interaction in response to cargo binding. In this way, the SRP RNA potentially provides a checkpoint to improve the fidelity of the classical SRP pathway, which needs to sort a diverse array of cellular proteins and to recognize signal sequences with different amino acid composition. In contrast, a much smaller number of proteins needs to be sorted inside the stroma of chloroplast, and the post-translational cpSRP pathway appears to be dedicated for delivery of the LHCP family of proteins to the thylakoid membrane. More specific binding interactions between cpSRP and its cargo protein can be established to ensure the fidelity of the cpSRP pathway, and this alleviates the need to build in additional fidelity checkpoints by using the SRP RNA as a kinetic regulator.\n\na The rate and equilibrium constants are defined in Figure 1.
