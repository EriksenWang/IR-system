    "full_text": "MUCH PROGRESS has been made in recent years in the development of a theoretical framework for the formulation of variational principles (Sewell, 1969;Noble & Sewell, 1972;Sewell, 1973a,b;Herrera, 1974;Herrera & Bielak, 1976;Sewell & Noble, 1976). A contribution due to Sewell (1973a) allows one to generate dual variational principles from a single functional and to unify the theory. Herrera (1974), and Herrera & Bielak (1976), developed a formulation of variational principles using functional-valued operators which simplifies the treatment of partial differential equations because it is applicable in any linear space, not necessarily normed, nor with an inner product, nor complete. The situation has been summarized by Herrera & Bielak (1976).\n\nA sufficient condition for an operator equation to admit a variational formulation is that the operator be potential, and this will be so if and only if its derivative is a symmetric bilinear functional. Variational and extremum principles are interrelated because a necessary condition for the existence of a stationary extremum is the vanishing of the variation. A sufficient condition for a variational principle to be extremum is that the generating functional be either convex or concave. In general, a functional is neither convex nor concave; however, if the linear space in which the functional is defined can be decomposed into two subspaces, one in which the functional is convex and another in which it is concave, the functional is saddle, so that Noble & Sewell's results can be applied; then the variational principle becomes a pair of dual principles. Such a decomposition can be expected to exist under very general conditions, at least locally, because this is the case for surfaces in finite dimensional spaces.\n\nFor linear operators the theory becomes especially simple. A sufficient condition for a linear equation to admit a variational formulation is that the operator be 95 symmetric. If the operator is either positive or negative, then the associated functional is either convex or concave, and consequently the variational principle is an extremum one. In general a symmetric linear operator is neither positive nor negative, but under very general conditions (e.g. when spectral theorems are applicable), the linear space D in which the operator is defined can be decomposed into two subspaces, one D+ in which the operator is non-negative and another D-in which it is non-positive; then the associated functional is saddle and the variational principle generates dual extremum principles of Sewell's type. Accordingly, it is possible to associate dual extremum principles to arbitrary equations formulated in terms of linear symmetric operators.\n\nThe main advantages of using functional-valued operators are (Herrera & Bielak, 1976):\n\n(i) Problems are formulated in the most general kind of linear spaces, which are not necessarily normed, nor with an inner product, nor complete. Most work in this field has been done in either inner product spaces (Noble & Sewell, 1972;Sewell, 1969Sewell, , 1973a,b;,b;Sewell & Noble, 1976) or in Hilbert spaces (Arthurs, 1970;Robinson, 1971;Collins, 1976;Brezis & Ekeland, 1976) and it is generally thought that this is desirable, if not essential, for the results to hold. In many applications the introduction of the Hilbert space structure leads to unwarranted complications. This is not required when functional-valued operators are used.\n\n(ii) The introduction of superfluous hypotheses in the development of a theory is always inconvenient, because frequently they needlessly restrict its applicability.\n\n(iii) The symmetry condition for the potentialness of an operator can be extended to linear spaces for which no inner product or norm have to be defined (Herrera, 1974). This fact makes it possible to formulate a theory which is rigorous and at the same time not complicated.\n\n(iv) Error bounds for approximate solutions are among the most important results that the theory yields. They depend, however, on simple properties which are independent of any Hilbert space structure, and therefore can be obtained in the simple setting developed by Herrera. General results for such bounds are given in Section 3 of this paper; they induce a metric in the space. By using these bounds it is possible to define weak or generalized solutions; however, these will not be discussed here. Certain crror bounds for non-linear problems have been described by Sewell & Noble (1976).\n\nThe application of the theory of functional-valued operators to partial differential equations requires one to express them in terms of such operators. This is achieved by repeated use of integration by parts formulae. In this respect, the main advantage over standard formulations is derived from the fact that such manipulations can be carried out more systematically; for example, the operators involved always possess an adjoint. A discussion of the treatment of boundary conditions has already been given (Herrera, 1974;Herrera & Bielak, 1976); and in another way by Noble & Sewell (1972 et seq.).\n\nDue to its generality, the usefulness of the concept of saddle functional is great. In applications the flexibility of this concept is enhanced by the fact that its definition (Sewell, 1969, Section 2 (vii» depends essentially on the system of coordinates used. This is a fundamental difference with respect to the same concept when applied to surfaces; the saddle property of a surface is independent of the system of coordinates used.\n\nIn some applications it may be difficult to find a decomposition of the space with respect to which the functional is saddle. For linear problems (Herrera, 1974), this amounts to constructing a decomposition (D+, D_) of the space, such that the operator is non-negative on D+ and non-positive on D_. However, the restrictions imposed by these conditions are not too severe, because such a decomposition is not unique, and in this paper a wide class of variational principles is given for which it is easily obtained.\n\nFor initial value problems only stationary and not extremum principles had been obtained, until recently. However Herrera (1974) obtained dual extremum principles for initial value problems that were later applied to a large class of problems by Herrera & Bielak (1976). Later Collins (1976) extended these results to a general kind of dissipative system by considering simultaneously the adjoint equation. In France, extremum principles for initial value problems corresponding to certain parabolic equations have just been obtained (Brezis & Ekeland, 1976); they impose more severe restrictions on the boundary conditions than those mentioned above.\n\nThe procedure used by Collins for dis~pative systems (essentially, the mirror method) to generalize Herrera's principles offers interesting possibilities, because this approach is not limited to dissipative systems. In this paper a general procedure for deriving dual extremum principles by the mirror method is developed; it is applicable to any linear problem formulated in terms of a non-negative (or alternatively non-positive) functional-valued operator. To illustrate the method, it is applied to the heat and the wave equations. To our knowledge, these are the first extremum principles for the initial value problem associated with the wave equation, even though further work will be required to apply them. The principles derived for the heat equation are different from those available up to now and impose less restrictive conditions on the test functions.\n\nA brief description of the theory of functional-valued operators is given in Section 2 and saddle operators are introduced there. Variational and extremum principles for arbitrary saddle operators are given in Section 3 and in the next Section these results are used to develop a general theory of non-negative unsymmetric operators. Section 5 is devoted to extending this theory to problems defined in affine subspaces. Some applications of the theory to partial differential equations are given in Section 6. Only the heat and wave equations are considered, but the application of the theory to other equations can be made in a similar manner.\n\nThe notion of saddle functional (Sewell, 1969;Noble & Sewell, 1972) has been used extensively in the formulation of dual extremum principles and Herrera (1974) has used it to develop an approach adequate for the treatment of partial differential equations (Herrera & Bielak, 1974, 1976). In this section a version of this method which is suitable for linear problems will be described.\n\nLet D be any linear space, not necessarily metric, nor normed, nor with an inner product, nor complete. The value of any real linear functional/: D ~ R at an element ..\n\nV E D is a real number to be denoted by <h v). It is emphasized that this is not an inner product, even though the same notation is often used for such (in particular by Noble & Sewell, 1972). The linear space of all such functionals will be denoted by D*.\n\nConsider a linear operator P: D -+ D * which is therefore a functional-valued linear operator. Thus, for each u ED there is an element Pu E D*, and the value of this functional at any v E D is (Pu, v). Given any such operator, the adjoint operator P*: D -+ D*, defined by the condition that\n\nis satisfied vu E D and vv E D, always exists. The' operator P will be said to be symmetric, or self-adjoint, whenever p* = P. It is important to observe that the definition of adjoint operator given here is simpler than some others frequently used; in particular it does not require the definition of D** nor the condition D** = D, as the examples in Section 6 show. This is an advantage of the use of functional-valued operators (Herrera, 1974). (2.2b) From these definitions it follows that ; /=/1+/2 (2.3a), P = P1+P2.\n\n(2.3b) Definition 2.1. Let E c: D be a subspace of D. Then an operator P: D -+ D* is said to be non-negative on E if (Pu, u) ;::: 0 for every U e E;\n\n(2.4) and positive on E if the equality sign in (2.4) holds 6nly when u = O. When E = D the specification \"on E\" will be omitted.\n\nIf P is non-negative on E the non-negative square root of (Pu, u) will be denoted by Ilu lip whenever u e E.  Due to this fact it is possible to formulate variational principles for the system (4.1).\n\nThe procedure just described is a rigorous generalization of the mirror method (Morse & Feshbach, 1953). (4.9) In general when a self-adjoint operator which is functional-valued and linear is given, it is possible to find decompositions fJI and fJII of the space, such that the operator is saddle with respect to them (Herrera & Bielak, 1976). Finding such decompositions may be difficult in some instances; however, for the operator P here considered this is achieved easily. LEMMA 4.2. Let a, P, y, <5 be real numbers such that a<5 -py ~ 0, ap < 0, and y<5 > O. Define\n\n1)1 = {UE 1) I aUt+pU2 = O}1)11 = {U E 1) I YUt +I5U2 = a}. ).,= .\n\n1Xt> -fly (ii) The operator P is saddle with respect to 1)1' 1)110 Even more, if P is strictly positive then P is strictly saddle.\n\n(iii) Let In view of (4.9) and (4.IOa), for every U E fjl one has -aP(Pu, u) = a2(PU1' Ul)+p2(PU2, U2) ~ O.\n\nSimilarly, for every U E fjll yc5(Pu, u) = -r(PU1' ul)-c52(PU2' U2) ~ O.\n\nFrom this property (ii) follows easily. Property (iii) is obtained by direct computations.\n\nThe definition of projections implies that equation (3.7a) is satisfied if and only if <Pa-J, t) = 0 (4.16) for every t) E /)1. Using equations (4.3), (4.4) and (4.l0a), it is seen that (4.16) is equivalent to -CX(PU1-j, V1)+P(P*U2-g, V1) = 0 (4.17) for every V1 e D. Hence (4.l5a). The proof of (4.l5b) is similar.\n\nIn view of this lemma, Theorem 3.4 can be applied to this case. THEOREM 4.3. Let X: fj -+ R be given by ( 4 Proof. Using Lemma 4.2, the proof of this theorem is a straightforward application of Theorem 3.4.\n\nIn many applications to partial differential equations, the operator involved may be saddle or non-negative when attention is restricted to functions satisfying certain boundary conditions. In such problems the admissible functions usually constitute an affine subspace and the theory would be unduly restricted if such cases were not included.\n\nA set I c: 1) is said to be an affine subspace if there is a subspace £ c: 1) and an element WE 1) such that I = w+£. Clearly, £ = I when WE £, so that a linear subspace is always an affine subspace.\n\nGiven a functional X: 1) -+ R, for each U E I the variation of X at U is a linear functional 8X(u) E £*, such that (8X(u), D) = (X'(u), v) (5.1) for every D E £. When a decomposition £1' £11 of £ is available, at every U E I the partial variations 8iX(u) E £* (i = I, II) are defined in a manner similar to partial derivatives (Herrera & Bielak, 1974). Proof This follows from Theorem 5.3, observing that the affine subspace 11 is determinative for problem 4.2, while P is saddle on E = E E9 E with respect to the decomposition E., Ell of E. Here (5. lOb)\n\nIn the applications to be considered, G will be a region in n-dimensional euclidean space, with closure G and boundary 8 = 81 U 82, where 81 and 82 are disjoint. The linear space D of functions will be assumed to be such that the differential operators and integrals are well defined (possibly in a generalized sense). Such would be the case if the functions are C2 on G x [0, T]; this is however, unnecessarily restrictive.\n\nFor every u, v E D, the operator P: D -+ D* will be defined by:\n\nUsing integration by parts, a convenient expression for the adjoint operator is obtained: x.\n\nx.\n\n, , A more standard form of these problems for the heat equation is obtained by replacing equations (6.7d) and (6.9d) by Ul =/0 on G at t = 0 (6.10) and U2 = gT on Gat t = T (6.11) respectively. When these equations hold, the corresponding problems will be called initial and terminal value problems respectively. Observe! that a solution of problem (6.7) or (6.9) may differ from those of the latter by at most a constant.\n\nThe space fj and the operator P: fj -+ fj * is defined as in Section 4. The functional X given by equation (4.6) is:\n\nIT {I [aU2(aUt a2Ul Let v E A; then a straightforward computation shows that U.,i' U.,2 E D as given by (6.13) satisfy equations (6.19a-d). On the other hand, equation (6.1ge) is also satisfied by U.,2, by virtue of (6.14a). In a similar fashion, it is shown that given wEB, Ubi and Ub2 satisfy equations (4. 15b). Assertion (i) follows from Theorem 4.3 and the fact that the U functions satisfy equations (6.10) and (6.11).\n\nWhen equation (4.15a) is satisfied the functional X, given by (4.6), becomes In view of these facts and property (i), Theorem 4.3 yields the rest of the theorem. Dual variational principles for diffusion equations were first obtained by Herrera (1974;Herrera & Bielak, 1976). Later Collins (1976) extended Herrera's results to a more general class of dissipative systems. Independently Brezis & Ekeland (1976) have obtained such principles for a class of parabolic equations. For the heat equation, Theorem 6.2 represents a definite improvement over previous results because these require solving Laplace's equation at every time t. Brezis & Ekeland's (1976) principles are in addition restricted to the case where S2 is void and u vanishes identically on S.\n\nDual variational principles for the heat equation that have been derived in the past (Herrera, 1974;Herrera & Bielak, 1976;Collins, 1976;Brezis & Ekeland, 1976) can also be obtained using the general theory presented here. For this purpose, the operatorP: D -+ D* may be defined by: f T {f { au a2u ) i av i au }\n\nwhich is positive on the linear subspace of functions with vanishing normal derivatives on 82, The extension of the theory to problems formulated in affine subspaces, developed in Section 5, can then be applied to this operator to obtain those results. However, the details will not be carried out here.\n\nFor every u, v E D, the operator P: D -+ D* will be defined by: x.\n\nx. , ,\n\nAs in the case of the heat equation, the initial and terminal value problems are defined replacing (6.28e) and (6.30e) by equations (6.10) and (6.11) respectively; the observation made there about the relation between their solutions also applies here.\n\nThe space fj and the operator P: fj -+ fj* will now be ~fined as in Section 4.
