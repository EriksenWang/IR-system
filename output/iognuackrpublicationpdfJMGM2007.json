    "abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential enzymes involved in protein biosynthesis in all living organisms and are an unexploited antibacterial targets, as many strains of bacteria have become resistant to all established classes of antibiotics. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to discover new lead molecules which would be useful as anti-bacterial compounds. Pharmacophore models were developed by using CATALYST HypoGen with a training set of 29 diverse methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) inhibitors. The best quantitative pharmacophore hypothesis (Hypo1) obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.975, root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.55 and cost difference (null cost-total cost) of 70.32. This Hypo1 was validated by two methods, first by using 104 test set molecules which resulted a correlation of 0.926 between HypoGen estimated activities versus experimental activities and secondly by Cat-Scramble validation method. This validated pharmacophore model was further used for screening databases for discovery of new MetRS inhibitors. The new lead compounds were further analyzed for drug-like properties. Homology modeled structure of Staphylococcus aureus MetRS was built and molecular docking studies were performed with many inhibitors using the newly built protein structure. Finally, it was found that the new leads exhibited good estimated inhibitory activity, calculated binding properties similar to experimentally proven compounds and also favorable drug-like properties.",
    "full_text": "Translation is one of the most complex biological processes, involving diverse protein factors and enzymes as well as messenger and transfer RNAs. As this process is required for the basic operation of cells, many translational factors and enzymes are considered to be housekeeping proteins [1]. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) catalyze the ligation of specific amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, which is the initial step in protein synthesis [2]. The aminoacylation reaction proceeds in two stages. First, aaRSs activate their substrate amino acids by forming aminoacyl adenylate. Second, the enzyme-bound reaction intermediates are transferred to the 3 0 acceptor end of the tRNAs docking onto their active sites [3]. As tRNAs cannot distinguish amino acids, the correct recognition of specific amino acids and tRNAs by aaRS enzymes is a crucial determinant to maintain the fidelity of protein synthesis [4]. Therefore, aaRSs are the essential enzymes for biological cell growth. The twenty aaRSs are divided into two classes, I and II. The 10 class I aaRSs are considered to have a common catalytic domain structure based on the Rossmann fold, which is totally different from the class II catalytic domain structure [5][6][7]. The class I synthetases are further divided into three subclasses, a-c, according to sequence homology [8].\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is known to cause many forms of infections like superficial skin lesions, deep-seated infections such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis, hospital acquired (nosocomial) infection of surgical wounds, food poisoning by releasing enterotoxins into food, toxic shock syndrome by release of superantigens into the blood stream, etc,. Inhibition of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) can be a crucial step in the control of bacterial growth and can act as a novel bacterial target, thus not being susceptible to established mechanisms of bacterial resistance. Previously a 3D-QSAR design was performed using S. aureus MetRS inhibitors while molecular docking studies were done with E. coli MetRS structure [9]. Unlike QSAR study, which is based on single scaffold containing molecules, pharmacophore model design is based on diverse existing inhibitors. Therefore, pharmacophore models were developed using the HypoGen module implemented in CATALYST4.10 software [10] and molecular docking studies were done using homology modeled S. aureus MetRS structure. CATALYST is one of the leading automated drug design software [11] since a large number of successful applications were clearly demonstrated in medicinal chemistry [12][13][14].\n\nThe main aim of this study is to construct a pharmacophore model based on key chemical features of compounds with MetRS inhibitory activity covering five orders of magnitude. The obtained pharmacophore model can provide a rational hypothetical picture of the primary chemical features responsible for activity, and is expected to provide useful knowledge for developing new potentially active candidates targeting the MetRS which are useful as anti-bacterial agents. Hence, the best pharmacophore model was selected carefully and was validated. New compounds with similar features were obtained from Maybridge database and they were screened based on their estimated activity, GOLD docking scores using S. aureus MetRS homology model and calculated drug-like properties.\n\nWe have collected aaRSs inhibitors with their biological activity data from various medicinal chemistry as well as life science journals and developed a unique database using MDL ISIS/Base [15]. Our aaRS inhibitor database comprises of 595 compounds with experimental activities, out of which 246 compounds were against MetRS target (Fig. 1a). The highest number of compounds with MetRS inhibitory activity are in the molecular weight range 400-500 (Fig. 1b).\n\nThe training set comprising of 29 compounds (Nos. 1-29) was used to generate HypoGen hypotheses by considering structural diversity and wide coverage of activity range [16][17][18][19][20]. Conformationally restricted analogues of the central linker unit of S. aureus MetRS inhibitors [18] have been included in the training set. All the training set compounds from the literature have similar MetRS inhibitory assay. Before starting the pharmacophore generation process, conformational models for the molecules was developed by poling algorithm, which seeks to provide a broad coverage of conformational space using the best conformer generation method with a maximum conformational energy of 20 kcal/mol above the lowest energy conformation found [21,22]. The number of conformers generated for each compound was limited to a maximum number of 250.\n\nPharmacophore models were developed using HypoGen module implemented in CATALYST and the top 10 scoring hypotheses were exported. Analyses of the best ranking pharmacophore model revealed that four chemical features that are one H-bond donor (HBD), one hydrophobic aliphatic (HY-ALI) and two ring aromatic (RA) features could effectively map all the chemical features. The activity of each training set compound is estimated using regression parameters. The parameters are computed by the regression analysis using the relationship of geometric fit value versus the negative logarithm of activity. The greater the geometric fit, the greater the activity prediction of the compound. The fit function does not only check if the feature is mapped or not; it also contains a distance term which measures the distance that separates the feature on the molecule from the centroid of the hypothesis feature. Both terms are used to calculate the geometric fit value. The Error value shows the ratio of estimated activity to experimental activity. A positive error value indicates that the estimated IC 50 is higher than the experimental IC 50 while a negative error value indicates that the estimated IC 50 is lower than the experimental IC 50 .\n\nThe main purpose of validating a quantitative model is to determine whether our model is able to identify active structures and forecast their activity accurately. Therefore, two validation procedures were followed namely, test set prediction method and Cat-Scramble method. The 104 compounds were used as test set to validate the pharmacophore model. The Cat-Scramble validation procedure is based on Fischer's randomization test. The goal of this type of validation is to check whether there is a strong correlation between the chemical structures and the biological activity. This is done by randomizing the activity data associated with the training set compounds, generating pharmacophore hypotheses using the same features and parameters to develop the original pharmacophore hypothesis. The statistical significance is calculated as following formula:\n\nwhere x is the total number of hypotheses having a total cost lower than HypoX (original hypothesis), and y is the total number of HypoGen runs (initial + random runs). Thus 19 random spreadsheets (or 19 HypoGen runs) have to be generated for 95% confidence level. If the randomized data set results in the generation of a pharmacophore with similar or better cost values, RMSD, and correlation, then the original hypothesis is considered to have been generated by chance.\n\nCATALYST generated best pharmacophore model comprising of four chemical features was used as a query for searching Maybridge chemical database consisting of 60,000 structurally diversified small molecules. Virtual screening of such databases can serve two main purposes: first, validating the quality of the generated pharmacophore models by selective detection of compounds with known inhibitory activity, and second, finding novel, potential leads suitable for further development. Best flexible search method was used for database searching to retrieve new lead molecules.\n\nBLAST (blastp) was employed to search the relevant target or template proteins for building S. aureus MetRS protein structure. ClustalW multiple sequence alignment method was applied to compare the S. aureus MetRS sequence with other bacterial MetRS. The MODELLER module in INSIGHTII software was used to develop the homology model [23][24][25]. Sequence alignments were achieved by Align2d method and the final 3D model was validated by PROCHECK software [26].\n\nThe program GOLD 3 (Genetic Optimisation for Ligand Docking) from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, UK [27] uses genetic algorithm for docking flexible ligands into protein binding sites to explore the full range of ligand conformational flexibility with partial flexibility of the protein.\n\nA pseudoatom was created at binding site region of modeled S. aureus MetRS whose coordinates were taken to define active site region with a active site radius of 8.0 A ˚. The annealing parameters of van der Waals and H-bond interactions were considered within 4.0 and 2.5 A ˚, respectively.\n\nA set of 10 hypotheses was generated using a training set of 29 compounds (Fig. 2). The HypoGen module in CATALYST performs a 'fixed cost' calculation which represents the simple model that fits all data perfectly, and a 'null cost' calculation which presumes that there is no relationship in the dataset and that the experimental activities are normally distributed around their average value. A meaningful pharmacophore hypothesis may result when the difference between null and fixed cost value is large. In this study the null cost value of the top 10 hypotheses is 189.084, and the fixed cost value is 114.072 with a difference of 75.012 bits. The total cost of any pharmacophore hypothesis should be close to the fixed cost. All 10 hypotheses have a total cost close to the cost of the fixed hypothesis. The cost values, correlation coefficients (r), root mean square deviations (RMSDs), and pharmacophore features are listed in Table 1. Configuration cost value must be less than 17 for a good pharmacophore and accordingly 15.402 bits was obtained.\n\nAll the 10 hypotheses contain four features each and three of them, H-bond donor (HBD), hydrophobic aliphatic (HY-ALI) and ring aromatic (RA) features were common. Six of the 10 hypotheses had RA, three hypotheses had HY-ALI while only one had HBD as the fourth feature. Hypo1 consists of one HBD, HY-ALI and two RA features. The RMSD indicates the quality of prediction for the training set. In this case the RMSD value of the best hypothesis Hypo1 is 0.55, which represents a good prediction by Hypo1. The correlation coefficient for the Hypo1, 0.975 shows a good correlation by linear regression of the geometric fit index. All these results conclude that Hypo1 is the best ranking pharmacophore among the 10 obtained.\n\nAll compounds both in the training set and in the test set were classified into three activity scales: highly active (+++, IC 50 100 nM); moderately active (++, 1000 nM > IC 50 > 100 nM), and inactive compounds (+, IC 50 ! 1000 nM). Activities were estimated for all compounds based on the best ranking pharmacophore (Hypo1). The experimental and estimated activities for 29 training set compounds are shown in Table 2. Out of 29 compounds one high active compound (+++) was estimated as moderately active (++), two moderately active (++) compounds were estimated as inactive (+) and one moderately active compound was estimated as highly active (+++). All inactive molecules were estimated as inactive only. Two of the highest active compounds (1 and 2) in the training set with an estimated activities of 3.5 nM (IC 50 = 3.3 nM) and 5.5 nM (IC 50 = 5 nM) and fit values of 8.21 and 8.01, respectively, were mapped with Hypo1 (Fig. 3a and b).\n\nIn order to verify if the hypothesis can also estimate the activity of compounds that are structurally distinct from those included in the training set, we have applied a test set of 104 compounds, selected from literature representing diverse activity classes and different structural groups. All test molecules were imported into CATALYST from internal MetRS database and conformers were generated in a similar way as for the training set compounds. Hypo1 was used to estimate the activities for test set compounds using score hypothesis method. Analyses of the estimated activities of test set revealed interesting results, out of 104 compounds, 101 compounds had the error value of less than 10, representing a not more than one order difference between experimental and estimated activity. All 61 active compounds in the test set were estimated as highly active. The 60% of moderately active compounds were estimated appropriately. Among 29 inactive compounds, 4 compounds were estimated as moderately active. The predictive ability of Hypo1 was very impressive and the correlation graph between experimental and estimated activities (Fig. 4) achieved 0.926 correlation value. As very few compounds within the range of 30-130 nM were obtained from the literature, we used them in the training set. Thus equal distribution of test set compounds with activity, particularly in the mentioned range could not be obtained. Two highly active test set compounds, Test 8 and 46 (IC 50 = 7 and 18 nM, respectively), were mapped with Hypo1 (Fig. 3c and d). Hypo1 features matched very well with the chemical groups of these two compounds with accurate estimated IC 50 values of 6.2 and 18 nM, respectively.\n\nAnother approach to validate the quality of HypoGen hypothesis was to apply cross validation using the Cat-Scramble program available from CATALYST. In this validation test, we have selected 95% confidence level, and thus 19 spreadsheets (Table 3) were generated. The data of cross validation clearly indicates that all values generated after randomization, produced hypotheses with no predictive value similar or near to that of Hypo1. Out of the 19 runs, only four had a correlation between 0.70 and 0.80, but the RMSD were high and total costs were close to the null cost, which is not desirable for a good hypothesis. Thus these two validation procedures provided strong confidence on the initial pharmacophore hypothesis, Hypo1.\n\nThe validated pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was used as a search query to retrieve molecules with novel and desired chemical features from multi-conformational Maybridge   chemical database consisting of 60,000 compounds. Inhibitory activities were estimated for the 5439 compounds that were retrieved from Maybridge database. Compounds that had HypoGen estimated activity 50 nM were considered as best active compounds. The 400 compounds satisfied the specified cutoff value and hence proceeded for further evaluation. The mapping of Hypo1 on top two hits found in Maybridge database search named as AW01179 and BTB00521 are represented in Fig. 6. Sequence alignment result between the template protein (MetRS of T. thermophilus represented with PDBID, 1A8H) and the target protein (MetRS of S. aureus represented as subject). The asterisks (*) indicate the conserved residues between the two proteins. database. Lipinski's rule-of-five is a simple model to forecast the absorption and intestinal permeability of a compound [28,29]. Molinspiration online database (www.molinspira- tion.com) gives information of miLogP, molecular weight,  number of H-bond donors, acceptors and rotatable bonds based on the chemical structure [30,31]. According to the rule-of-five model, compounds were considered likely to be well-absorbed when they possess LogP < 5, molecular weight < 500, number of H-bond donors < 5, and number H-bond acceptors < 10. Number of rotatable bonds were also restricted to 10 as previous studies [32] suggest that candidate design directed at reduced flexibility (rotatable bonds < 10) and satisfying Lipinski's rule would increase the success in achieving compounds with high oral bioavailability. The 199 compounds have satisfied Lipinski's rule among 400 compounds. Analyses of these 199 new hits which satisfied H-bond acceptors, donors, miLogP as well as rotatable bonds criteria are provided in Fig. 5.\n\nThere is no binding mechanism or any docking studies done for S. aureus MetRS until now although we have effective inhibitors for MetRS. This is due to the lack of an appropriate crystal structure. Therefore, we have developed 3D-model structure using homology modeling method. Fig. 6 shows the sequence alignment between the target protein, S. aureus MetRS, and the template protein (Fig. 7a), T. thermophilus MetRS (PDB ID: 1A8H). BLAST (blastp) showed about 38% sequence identity between the two sequences. The final homology modeling calculation using MODELLER generated a very reliable 3D structure of S. aureus MetRS (Fig. 7b and c) since PROCHECK, protein structure validation program, predicted that the 90.8% of residues of the 3D structure lied in most favored regions unlike the template protein which has 87.6% of residues in most favored regions. The RMSD between the template and the target structures is 0.37 A ˚. Multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW revealed the conserved aminoacids present in the modeled and other similar class proteins (Fig. 8). The methionine binding pocket of E. coli is formed by key aminoacids such as L13, Y15, H23, D52, W253, A256, Y260 G294, K295, D296, H301, and W305. Most of the residues are conserved in all five bacterial MetRS. Similar residues like I12, A270 and E272 of S. aureus were present in the place of L13, G294, D296 residues of E. coli, respectively, while the rest of the binding pocket residues were the same.\n\nTraining set of 29 compounds as well as all 199 new hits retrieved from the multi-conformational Maybridge chemical database which have satisfied drug-like properties were docked in the modeled S. aureus MetRS active site region using GOLD docking software. GOLD dock score which distinguishes molecules based on their interacting ability is calculated for all molecules. Compound 1, the most active molecule in training set showed 58.19 dock score and formed H-bonding with the two active site residues of I12 and E272. Latest docking studies on E. coli MetRS revealed that L13 and E296 are key residues in active site [33]. Some of the hits retrieved in database search also showed good dock scores and formed similar type of interactions with these two active site amino acids. Fig. 9a represents the H-bond interaction between compound 1 and active site amino acids. The 77 out of 199 compounds which obtained a GOLD dock score !55 were considered as final hits for further evaluation. Compound AW01179 retrieved from the Maybridge database have good HypoGen estimated activity (2.8 nM) as well as good GOLD fitness score (55.15) and it also formed similar interactions with I12 and E272 (Fig. 9b). Compound BTB00521 also showed good estimated activity (4.5 nM) and better GOLD fitness score, 62.97 than the best active molecule from the training set (Fig. 9c). These two molecules (Fig. 10) showed extraordinary results with respect to all properties like estimated activity, binding affinity, calculated drug-like properties and thus can be treated as good leads in the design of potent inhibitors of S. aureus MetRS.\n\nOur pharmacophore hypothesis was able to accurately estimate the activities of known inhibitors with a correlation factor of 0.926. The mapping information based on the pharmacophore model we developed is now being taken advantage in the identification of novel lead compounds with improved inhibitory activity through 3D database searches. The homology model structure of S. aureus MetRS was very much helpful in exploring the binding site interactions and evaluating compounds with good dock score. The 77 new hits showed good estimated activities, higher GOLD dock scores as well as drug-like properties. These compounds calculated binding properties are very similar with experimentally proved compounds. Some of these compounds may have better in vitro activity against S. aureus MetRS. Therefore, our pharmacophore model is able to search new hits in any chemical databases and give good molecules which may have good anti-bacterial activity.\n\na\n\na + Indicates that the estimated IC 50 is higher than the experimental IC 50 ; À indicates that the estimated IC 50 is lower than the experimental IC 50 . b Fit value indicates how well the features in the pharmacophore overlap the chemical features in the molecule. c MetRS activity scale: +++, IC 50 100 nM (high active); ++, 1000 nM > IC 50 > 100 nM (moderately active); +, !1000 nM (inactive).\n\na Null cost is 189.084.\n\nN.
