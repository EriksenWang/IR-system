    "abstract": "Background: Sp4 is a zinc finger transcription factor which is closely related to Sp1 and Sp3. All three proteins recognize the same DNA elements and can act as transcriptional activators through glutaminerich activation domains. Unlike Sp1 and Sp3, which are ubiquitous proteins, Sp4 is highly abundant in the central nervous system, but also detectable in many other tissues.\nResults:\nWe have disrupted the mouse Sp4 gene by a targeted deletion of the exons encoding the Nterminal activation domains. Sp4 knockout mice show a complete absence of Sp4 expression. They develop until birth without obvious abnormalities. After birth, two-thirds die within 4 weeks. Surviving mice are growth retarded. Male Sp4 null mice do not breed. The cause for the breeding defect remains obscure since they show complete spermatogenesis. In addition, pheromone receptor genes in the vomeronasal organ appear unaffected. Female Sp4 null mice have a smaller thymus, spleen and uterus. In addition, they exhibit a pronounced delay in sexual maturation.\nConclusions:\nThe phenotype of the Sp4 null mice differs significantly from those described for Sp1 ±/± and Sp3 ±/± mice. Thus, the structural similarities, the common recognition motif and the overlapping expression pattern of these three transcription factors do not reflect similar physiological functions.",
    "full_text": "The Sp family of transcription factors is composed of five proteins (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp5) characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus (Harrison et al. 2000;Philipsen & Suske 1999;Suske 1999;Treichel et al. 2001). In addition, Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4 show similarities in their glutamine-rich N-terminal region (Suske 1999). The linkage of these four Sp genes to the four human Hox gene clusters also documents their close evolutionary relationship (Kalff- Suske et al. 1995Suske et al. , 1996;;Scohy et al. 1998). Sequence alignments revealed that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are more closely related to each other than to Sp2 (Philipsen & Suske 1999;Suske 1999). Consistently, Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 recognize the classical GC-box and the related GT/CACC-box with identical affinity (Hagen et al. 1992(Hagen et al. , 1994)). Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed, contrary to Sp4, which shows a complex expression pattern but is most abundant in neuronal tissues (Hagen et al. 1992;Supp et al. 1996).\n\nA large variety of biological functions have been assigned to Sp factor-binding sites. This raises the question of which of these functions are performed by which Sp protein in vivo. Gene ablation studies in mice have provided important clues to the answer to this question.\n\nSp1 targeted embryos are severely retarded in growth, and die after day 10 of embryonic development (E10). They display a wide range of abnormalities, but all characteristic hallmarks of this developmental stage are present. Blastocyst injections of Sp1-deficient embryonic stem cells showed that these cells contribute efficiently to early chimeric embryos, but after E11, this declines very rapidly with no detectable contribution to any tissue of newborn animals. Thus, Sp1 deficiency causes a cell-autonomous defect, and it appears that Sp1 function is generally required for cellular survival after E10 (Marin et al. 1997). Sp3deficient embryos are growth retarded and invariably die at birth of respiratory failure. The cause for the observed breathing defect is not clear. Only minor morphological alterations were observed in the lung, and surfactant protein expression is indistinguishable from wild-type mice. In addition, Sp3 ±/± mice show a pronounced defect in late tooth formation. The development of the dentin/enamel layer is impaired due to a strongly reduced expression of ameloblastspecific gene products (Bouwman et al. 2000). A mutation of the Sp4 gene has been reported previously (Supp et al. 1996). However, the mice in this study still expressed a truncated Sp4 mRNA fragment encoding the two strong activation domains at a high level. Thus, the question remains whether the phenotype of these Sp4 mutant mice reflects the physiological consequences of a complete Sp4 knockout. Sp5 ±/± mice show no overt phenotype (Harrison et al. 2000).\n\nHere we describe the targeted disruption of the mouse Sp4 gene by deleting the exons that encode for the N-terminal activation domains. We found that the complete absence of Sp4 has severe consequences for postnatal mouse development. Sp4 null mice develop until birth without obvious abnormalities. After birth, approximately two-thirds of the knockout mice die within 4 weeks. Those that survive are size retarded. Male Sp4 null mice do not breed and have a slightly reduced testis size. However, they show complete spermatogenesis. In addition, the pheromone receptor genes in the vomeronasal organ that are essential for mating behaviour appear to be unaffected. Female Sp4 2/± mice have a small thymus, spleen and uterus, and they reach puberty with a pronounced delay.\n\nTargeted disruption of the mouse Sp4 gene A targeting vector was designed to replace sequences that encode the N-terminal activation domains of Sp4 protein (amino acids 4±557). This was obtained by replacing exons 2 and 3 of the mouse Sp4 gene (Song et al. 2001) by IRES-LacZ-polyA/PGK-neo sequences in the targeting vector (Fig. 1). The lacZ gene is expressed under control of the endogenous Sp4 promoter. The phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter controls the neomycin resistance (neo) gene and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (hsvtk) gene to ensure expression in embryonic stem cells.\n\nThe targeting plasmid pPNTSp4i/e/IRES-LacZ (Fig. 1B) was linearized at a unique NotI site present in the vector for transfection into E14 ES cells. Cells were subsequently maintained under G418 and gancyclovir selection. A total of 200 G418 resistant colonies were analysed by Southern blotting for the homologous recombination event. Hybridization of EcoRV restricted DNA from individual clones with a BglII-BamHI intron fragment was predicted to show a . 10 kb fragment from the wild-type locus and a 6 kb fragment from a correctly targeted locus (Fig. 1B). One clone showed the predicted mutant fragment. In addition, PCR analysis with a set of primers specific for the wild-type and the targeted Sp4 gene confirmed the expected targeted disruption of the mouse Sp4 gene. Hybridization with a Bluescript vector probe showed no evidence for additional unwanted random integration events in this clone. The integrity of this clone was further confirmed by karyotyping. The targeted ES clone was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Breeding of male chimeras resulted in germ-line transmission of the targeted Sp4 allele.\n\nMatings of heterozygous Sp4 1/± animals were set up to obtain embryos deficient in both wild-type Sp4 alleles (Fig. 1C,D). To test whether this resulted in the complete loss of Sp4 gene expression, we performed Northern blot analyses of RNA from brain and heart of both control and Sp4 ±/± embryos (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous results, a probe coding for an N-terminal activation region of Sp4 detected two transcripts larger than 28S RNA in wild-type and Sp4 1/± mice. These transcripts were undetectable in Sp4 ±/± mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 1±3). In addition, a probe encoding for the zinc finger region also shows no signal in Sp4 ±/± mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 10 and 11). The absence of the Sp4 protein in homozygous Sp4 2/± mice was confirmed by Western blot analyses with an antiserum directed against the C-terminal domain of Sp4 (Fig. 2B). From these data we conclude that the Sp4 knockout mice lack any residual Sp4-specific transcripts and protein.\n\nTo analyse whether the expression of other members of the Sp-family of transcription factors is altered in H Go È llner et al.\n\nq Blackwell Science Limited Sp4 ±/± mice, we performed Northern analyses with Sp1-and Sp3-specific probes. These experiments revealed that the abundance of Sp1 transcripts was unchanged (Fig. 2A, lanes 4±6 and 12±13) whereas Sp3 transcripts were slightly (approximately twofold) enhanced in Sp4 ±/± mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 7±9). Thus, the absence of Sp4 might be partially compensated by enhanced transcription of the Sp3 gene.\n\nEmbryonic expression of the Sp4 LacZ allele in heterozygous Sp4 1/± mice Expression of Sp4 mRNA during embryonic development was previously monitored by in situ hybridization (Supp et al. 1996). Using the Sp4 IRES±lacZ allele driven by the Sp4 promoter, we were able to recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of the Transcription factor Sp4 null mice Sp4 gene. In whole mounts of heterozygous E12.5 embryos, b-galactosidase activity was highest in the central nervous system but also detectable in many other tissues (Fig. 3).\n\nSurvival rates and growth of Sp4 ±/± mice Heterozygous Sp4 1/± mice exhibited no discernible phenotype and were able to breed. Genotyping of embryos obtained by Caesarean section shortly before the parturition date (E18.5) showed no loss of Sp4 2/± mice up to birth (Table 1). Sp4 2/± newborn mice showed no obvious abnormalities at birth. However, approximately half of them died within 10 days of birth (Table 1). An additional 30% died within the following 3 weeks. Their cause of death remains undetermined. A comparison of growth rates (Fig. 4) revealed that within the first 4 weeks the gain of weight of the Sp4 2/± mice was almost arrested. After this period their growth appeared relatively normal. However, the body weight of the surviving Sp4 2/± mice never reached that of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4).\n\nWe determined standard blood parameters (red cells (haematocrit, cell volume, haemoglobin per cell), white cells, platelets) of the Sp4 ±/± mice. These fell within normal ranges. Furthermore, we determined alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, creatinin, lactate dehydrogenase 1, bilirubin, and urea levels in the circulation. Of these, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenease 1 were slightly elevated (20% increase) in the knockout mice, but this difference was not significant. Thus, the circulation is apparently normal and these data provide no clues to the physiological problems underlying the growth retardation of Sp4 null mice. Male Sp4 ±/± mice do not breed Breeding of Sp4 ±/± females with wild-type male mice Northern analyses of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcripts. RNA was extracted from heart (lanes 1±9) and brain (lanes 10±13) of wild-type (1/1), Sp4 1/± (1/±) and Sp4 2/± (±/±) E18.5 embryos, subjected to electrophoresis through 0.8% formaldehyde/agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes. The filters were hybridized with DNA-fragments encoding Sp4 (lanes 1±3 and 10±11), Sp1 (lanes 4±6, and 12±13) and Sp3 (lanes 7±9). Two different Sp4-specific probes encoding the glutamine-rich activation domain (lanes 1±3), and the DNAbinding domain (lanes 10±11) were used to detect Sp4 mRNA. The dots indicate the migration of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA. As a control, the filters were probed with an 18S ribosomal RNA specific oligonucleotide. (B) Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts (50 mg of protein) from brains of adult female wild-type (WT), heterozygous (Sp4 1/± ) and Sp4deficient (Sp4 ±/± ) mice were fractionated through 7.5% SDS± polyacrylamide gels, blotted on nitrocellulose filter and incubated with an Sp4-specific antiserum. Sp4 migrates as a 100 kDa protein. The asterisks depict an unspecific crossreacting protein. The genotype was determined by PCR analysis as described in Experimental procedures.\n\nH Go È llner et al.\n\nGenes to Cells (2001) 6, 689±697\n\nq Blackwell Science Limited was sporadically successful. However, all attempts to breed adult Sp4 ±/± males with female wild-type mice were unsuccessful. This prompted us to examine whether a failure of spermatogenesis might be responsible for the observed infertility of Sp4 ±/± males. Histological analyses of testicular and epididymal crosssections revealed complete spermatogenesis in the seminiferous epithelium (Fig. 5). In addition, luminal spermatozoa in the epididymis of Sp4 ±/± males were indistinguishable in numbers and shape from those in wild-type litter mates.\n\nThe highest expression of Sp4 is found in the central nervous system (Hagen et al. 1992). Thus, Sp4 might exert its essential functions primarily in the brain. Wild-type females that were mated with Sp4 ±/± males did not contain copulation plugs, indicating an altered reproductive behaviour of Sp4 ±/± males. Since the hypothalamus and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) play important roles in reproductive behaviour (Buck 1995), we examined the VNO and the hypothalamus in sections, but no gross abnormalities were found in these tissues (data not shown).    Transcription factor Sp4 null mice q Blackwell Science Limited Genes to Cells (2001) 6, 689±697 693\n\nSexual behavioural alterations may reflect an altered gene expression pattern in specific neuronal cells of the VNO. VNO neurones express pheromone receptors of different classes (Belluscio et al. 1999;Herrada & Dulac 1997;Matsunami & Buck 1997). Therefore, we asked whether the expression of a subset of pheromone receptors might be altered in Sp4 ±/± mice. We analysed the expression of two different receptor genes in the VNO of Sp4 ±/± neonatal mice by in situ hybridization (VR1-12 from the apical zone and VR2-9 from the basal zone). The expression of both genes was unaffected in Sp4 ±/± mice (Fig. 6). Thus, we consider it unlikely that the function of the VNO is impaired in Sp4 ±/± mice.\n\nThe onset of puberty is impaired in female Sp4 ±/± mice We determined the organ/body weight ratio of individual organs and found a significantly smaller thymus, spleen, uterus and testis in Sp4 ±/± mice compared to control mice (P , 0.05) (Fig. 7A). Other organs like the heart or kidney had a normal organ/ body weight ratio. A reduced uterus size was also observed in heterozygous Sp4 1/± females (Fig. 7B). The very small uterus in Sp4 ±/± females prompted us to examine the onset of puberty by determining vaginal opening time (VOT). We found that Sp4 ±/± females have a pronounced delay in vaginal opening time (VOT . 200 days) compared with wild-type and heterozygous Sp4 1/± mice (VOT , 40 days). The delayed puberty is in agreement with the small uteri of Sp4 ±/± females, which is characteristic for prepubertal immaturity.\n\nPhenotype of Sp4 null mice Our results demonstrate that the transcription factor Sp4 is important for the early postnatal survival of mice, since two-thirds of the newborn die within 4 weeks post-partum. The molecular cause for the observed death, however, remains unclear.\n\nSp4-deficient mice that survive are impaired in their reproduction. Adult Sp4 ±/± did not breed at all and the mating of Sp4 ±/± females was only sporadically successful. The reduced testis and uterus weights of Sp4-/± mice indicated that Sp4 plays an important role for the function of these organs. A direct action of Sp4 in these organs seems plausible, since Sp4 mRNA is expressed in testis and uterus (unpublished data).\n\nHowever, all attempts to detect a morphological alteration of the testis failed.\n\nOne could nevertheless speculate that the smaller reproductive organs are linked to the maturation of sexual functions, as reflected by the delay in the onset of puberty of Sp4 ±/± females. It is noteworthy that these animals also have a smaller thymus. The reduced H Go È llner et al.\n\nq Blackwell Science Limited thymus size and the delay in the onset of puberty may be physiologically linked. It is known that the thymus is involved in female sexual maturation, since neonatal thymectomized mice also show a significant delay in the onset of puberty (Besedovsky & Sorkin 1974).\n\nSp4 null mice vs. Sp4 mutant mice A targeted mutation of the Sp4 gene has been reported previously (Supp et al. 1996). Two exons coding for the three zinc fingers of the Sp4 DNA-binding domain were replaced by a targeting vector resulting in a 19 kb deletion of mouse genomic DNA. Such a large deletion, however, raises the possibility that the expression of an additional gene was disturbed. In addition, the Sp4 gene was not completely inactivated. A truncated Sp4 mRNA fragment encoding the two strong activation domains was still expressed at a high level (Supp et al. 1996). The expression of the activation domains of Sp4, however, might gain new functions or might interfere with other Sp-family members. It might act as a superactivator by interacting with glutamine-rich activation domains of other transcription factors. Indeed, such a mechanism has been demonstrated for the N-termini of Sp1 and Sp4. Both truncated proteins strongly enhance the transcriptional activity of Sp1 and Sp4 (Pascal & Tjian 1991;Hagen et al. 1995, and unpublished data). Therefore, it seems likely that the activation domains of Sp4 expressed in vivo also interfere with Sp1 or other transcription factors.\n\nThe Sp4 knockout mice described here do not express domains of Sp4 that might interfere with other transcription factors. Neither the activation domains nor the DNA-binding domain were expressed. Nevertheless, the Sp4 null mice exhibit at least partial similarities with Sp4 mutant mice lacking only the DNA-binding domain. Both the Sp4 null and the Sp4 mutant strains have a high mortality rate after birth and males do not breed. Body weight/organ ratios, or the onset of the puberty were not reported for the Sp4 mutant mice lacking only the DNA-binding domain. However, the extremely late onset of puberty is a phenotypic manifestation that would hardly have been missed by propagating this mouse strain. Thus, it seems likely that not all characteristic hallmarks of a Sp4 null mutation are detectable in mice lacking only the Sp4 DNA-binding domain.\n\nSp4 is closely related to the two ubiquitously expressed transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. All three proteins recognize the same DNA elements and can act as transcriptional activators through glutamine-rich activation domains (Dennig et al. 1996;Hagen et al. 1995Hagen et al. , 1994)). The essential physiological functions, however, appear to be significantly different. In contrast to Sp4 null mice, Sp1 mutant embryos are already severely retarded at early embryonic stages and die around day 10 of gestation (Marin et al. 1997). Sp3 2/± mice develop until birth but die a few minutes post-partum due to respiratory failure (Bouwman et al. 2000). Thus, the obvious structural similarity, the common DNA recognition motif and the overlapping expression pattern do not reflect similar physiological functions. Nevertheless, there might be many overlapping functions in vivo. Since Sp3 mRNA is up-regulated in Sp4 null mice, one could suggest that it might compensate at least partially for the loss of Sp4 in Sp4 null mice. To unravel precisely the degree of redundancy between the individual Sp transcription factors, it might be necessary to generate mice deficient for two or all three GC-box binding Sp factors.\n\nCloning and mapping of the mouse Sp4 gene\n\nThe cloning of the mouse Sp4 gene has recently been described (Song et al. 2001). A 11.8 kb BamHI fragment and three BglII fragments of 6.7 kb, 3.7 kb and 3.5 kb in length (Fig. 1A) that hybridized with the human Sp4 cDNA were subcloned into the BamHI site of the pBluescript KS vector leading to the plasmids pBS-11.5 (11.5 kb BamHI fragment), pBS-6.7 (6.7 kb BglII fragment), pBS-3.7 (3.7 kb BglII fragment) and pBS-3.5 (3.5 kb BglII fragment). Subsequently the plasmids clones were mapped by Southern blotting and partially sequenced.\n\nAs a starting plasmid we chose the 7.2 kb pPNT vector (Tybulewicz et al. 1991) that contains PGKneo and PGKhsvtk cassettes separated and flanked by a number of unique cloning sites. We first introduced a part of the third intron of the Sp4 gene into the multiple cloning site of the pPNT vector that separates the PGKneo and the PGKhsvtk cassettes. The 1.8 kb Sp4 intron fragment was obtained from plasmid pBS-6.7 (Fig. 1A) as a [Ecl136II]/XbaI-EcoRI fragment and cloned into XbaI-EcoRI restricted pPNT plasmid leading to pPNTSp4i. 5 Hflanking sequences and the first exon of the Sp4 gene were obtained from the plasmid pBS-11.5 (Fig. 1A\n\nE14 ES cells were electroporated with 15 mg of NotI-linearized targeting vector pPNTSp4i/e/IRES-LacZ. Clones were selected with G418 (200 mg/mL) and gancyclovir. Homologous recombination was analysed by Southern blotting of EcoRV-restricted genomic DNA with the probe indicated in Fig. 1. Unwanted random integrations were detected by hybridizing the blots with a Bluescript vector-specific probe.\n\nThe Sp4 1/± ES cell clone was karyotyped and microinjected in C57BL/6 host blastocysts. Chimeric males were mated to C57BL/6 females, and germ-line transmission was obtained. The F1 offspring were interbred to expand the stocks and to obtain Sp4 null mice.\n\nDNA was prepared from tail snips and analysed for the presence of wild-type and targeted Sp4 alleles by Southern blotting or PCR. Southern blots were performed under standard conditions using the 1.8 kb BglII-BamHI fragment of the third Sp4 intron as a probe. For PCR analyses, three primers were used, a sense primer in the Sp4 gene amplifying the wild-type allele (5 H -CCAGTAACAATCACTAGTGTTGCA-3 H ), a sense primer in the neomycin resistance gene amplifying the targeted allele (5 H -CATCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGA-3 H ) and an anti-sense primer in the Sp4 gene (5 H -CTCACAACCATATACCAATGC AAG-3 H ). PCR conditions were 94 8C, 1 min; 60 8C, 1 min; 72 8C, 1 min for 30 cycles.\n\nTotal RNA of mouse organs was extracted by the guadinium/ isothiocyanate procedure using the Qiagen kit. RNA was separated through 0.8% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted on to nylon membranes. Prehybridization and hybridization was carried out as described (Braun & Suske 1998). Gene-specific probes were obtained from appropriate plasmids or primer sets as follows. Sp4: 420 bp PCR-fragment amplified with A8-3 and A8-6 primers on plasmid pBS-6.7 (see above). Sp4Zn encoding the Sp4 zinc finger region: 340 bp PCR fragment (nucleotides 2074±2414 of the murine Sp4 cDNA) obtained by RT-PCR using mouse RNA as template. Sp1: 311-bp fragment containing nucleotides 1371±1682 of the rat Sp1 cDNA (Imataka et al. 1992) obtained by RT-PCR using mouse RNA as template. Sp3: 800 bp PstI fragment obtained from plasmid pBS4.6HindIII (Bouwman et al. 2000). The hybridization reaction with the Sp4 zinc finger encoding region as a probe contained 1 mg each of plasmids encoding Sp1 and Sp3 to avoid cross-hybridization of the Sp4 zinc finger probe with Sp1 and Sp3 transcripts.\n\nNuclear extracts (50 mg of protein) were prepared from adult female brains according to Gorski et al. (1986), separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted on nylon membranes, and probed with a rabbit anti-Sp4 serum (Santa Cruz sc-645). Primary antibodies were visualized using the Amersham ECL kit.\n\nWhole mount LacZ staining E12.5 embryos were dissected from uteri and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30±45 min and subsequently rinsed three times with LacZ rinse-buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl 2 , 0.01% sodium desoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min. LacZ staining was performed with 1 mg/mL of X-gal solution in LacZ rinse-buffer supplemented with 5 mm potassium ferricyanide and 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide over night at 37 8C. Embryos were post-fixed in 95% ethanol over night and stored in ethanol/glycerol (1 : 1).\n\nAnimals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Organs were collected and immediately frozen on dry ice prior to weight determination.\n\nq Blackwell Science Limited Genes to Cells (2001) 6, 689±697 691"
